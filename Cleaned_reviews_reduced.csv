Great love it
Lots of ads<br />Slow processing speed<br />Occasionally shuts down apps<br />WIFI keeps having authentication issues<br /><br />Was cheap for a tablet and now i know why.
"Excellent unit.  The versatility of this tablet, besides being competitively priced is a solution to the elderly.  Poor eyesight and physical disabilities associated with age and using the supporting add on features allows the user to stay in touch with our changing world.<br />A realistic add on keyboard that you can see and use.<br />I cannot wait to use my Fire HD7 to show computer created work sheets and class instructions to my students. (HMDI) Good by to copiers and reams of paper, Farwell to those costly printer inks!<br /><br />Oh yes I have much more to gain back.  Just takes a little effort to learn more, open a book and read.<br />Noel"
I bought this on Amazon Prime so I ended up buying the 16gb one for $95.  The camera is okay and I love the edit features you can do to the pictures.  Amazon/Netflix/Huliu all run smoothly on this tablet. The internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too.  While over all I am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that I wanted to make sure other people are aware of.  I am an Amazon Prime member and I thought that with Amazon Prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free. :(  Also one of the main reasons we purchased  a tablet was because my kids love the Plants vs Zombies games.  The kids were quite disappointed that Plants vs Zombies 2 is not available for the fire.  There are also other games/apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the Fire that were available for our previous cheaper Neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet.  I recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying.
All Amazon products continue to meet my expectations
Good product. I like it 😀
"This kindle works well but the battery goes dead more quickly than you'd expect. Really it is a version of the previous Kindle that weighs less. The internet browser works considerably better than the previous but still has issues loading certain websites. Pop-up ads are a challenge at times. Other than that it is about the same as the older version, a good product that serves its purpose well but I wouldn't rave about it."
"I really enjoy my new kindle, it is easy to use and offers plenty of useful and entertaining activities"
"It's what I wanted and performs perfectly. Everything works great, the menu system is awful. I'd go 5 stars if the menu system were better."
Made well. Like looks and style
Yes it met all of my needs 5 Stars
We have the old kindles but this one does a lot more.  Love it
Great product
The only complaint I have about this kindle is that the camera takes &#34;grainy&#34; pictures. After trying everything to fix the problem the pictures are not good.
great
"Just got it.  The promotional price was very good.  I was worried as my last android device was a real turkey.  My main purpose for this was as a reader .  It downloaded everything fairly fast and with no problems, from my Overdrive app.  I really need it for traveling.  It's a perfect size  The screen resolution if great.  I am not sure of the sound quality yet, but it expect it to be as good as most apple phones.  Amazon really bends over backwards to keep it's prime customers happy.  I really appreciate the good service."
I love this product
Love it!!!
"I really like using this HD display. I have not used all its features yet, but what I have used I live."
"Everything I expected and more. Have already gotten hours of entertainment and information. So much easier to read from, than paperbacks especially on vacation."
Its a nice tablet but I was disappointed to see that they deliberately made using Chromecast impossible
"Don't waste your money buying a kindle fire hd 7&#34;. You'll do 100 better buying any other tablet on the market. The Kindle is limited by Amazon and purposely doesn't allow downloads of apps that aren't on Amazon market place.  This tablet has soooo many problems !! AS in :  slow connection to internet, NO connection to internet possible much of the time, slow or no connection to videos, games, etc. NO support!!! Just reading other problems from other owners.  So, do yourself a huge favor and buy ANYTHING ELSE!!!  Mine was a gift from my well-meaning son."
"Still just as slow and glitchy as the first edition fire. Still not flash compatible which renders the browser useless. Freezes constantly, crap battery life and regularly occuring issues with loading the page you were on last.  Incredibly disappointing."
"I love it, I just wish I could download books without having internet service like I could with my keyboard Kindle."
Was a gift
Doesn't have as much space as I thought it has.
Excellent device. HD is top notch. Sound is great. Would definately recommend Fire HD
Just have to learn how to use
"I'm happy with my new Kindle Fire.  However, this is my second one because after a little more than a year, my first Kindle cannot be used since it refuses to charge up.  (Not happy about that!)"
I thought I would have to ask a professional to set me up with my new Kindle Fire HD.  NOT SO. I was able to program the Kindle easily on my own.  All of my previous books were already there. (In the Clouds). I was also able to download a few songs on my own.  I am enjoying my Kindle Fire HD.
Great item
I finally gave in a replaced my Paperwhite with a Fire. I really loved my Paperwhite and I think I'm going to love this as well. I use it every day and I get a little upset when I accidentally leave it at home and I don't have it with me.  This is one of the best purchases I've made for myself.
Perfect size with great capabilities. Very excited that  I made the choice to finally purchase one of these.
We've bought several for family members!
I have a Kindle addiction!
"Won't stay connected to the WiFi, am having to constantly log in no matter where I am (public, home, etc)."
The unit came with NO directions of use of any kind.  Don't know how to use it.  Guess I will have to buy a kindle.
Overall it's good for the kids.  I don't take advantage of all the things it can do.  But some things are confusing like how apps are loaded and then given to other profiles.  Each app uses space and must be loaded to each profile.  So for me the same app is taking up space 3 places for each profile.  And if you delete an app from the main profile it does not delete from the others.  And for the kids profile I can seem to get it removed at all!  It's not in the device screen but still shows in settings-it's really confusing.
Does everything I wanted it to do.
"It works so well, and fast! Not using it much yet until case comes in for fear of scratching fab display!"
Good value but the operating system is a little buggy. It periodically crashes and requires rebooting.
"I find that is not as easy to use as my regular Kindle Fire.  When I am reading the kindle it freezes up (because you hold it on the side).  Also you have to get out of it to brighten or darken your text that you are reading.  Lastly, the advertisements that come up every time you turn the HD Kindle Fire on are annoying."
"Returned.  Prefer a more open android tablet.  As far as quality...it is Amazon and they never disappoint.  So, if you are a strict Amazonian - this tablet is for you.<br /><br />The 2 stars are personal choice, not quality."
Love it!  Convenient and use the library to download books!  Should have done this a long time ago!
This generation has perfected the placement of all the ports. Very fast operation. Excellent sound. I love my new Kindle Fire HD!!
Can't personalize or connect with google.
It was a gift and  much appreciated.  I love it
Love it.
"The sound is amazing. The video is the best. I don't bother watching the news on the television anymore, I go straight to my Kindle Fire."
"This is the first real tablet I've used with any success. I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected."
Love it.
Great!
"Kindle is like a little computer that is lite to carry n your pocketbook n take with u everywhere.  The site comes n clear n safe. I use this device, more than my laptop. I can't wait to explore what else it has to offer."
Good choice
I like everything about it except that I don't think the battery lasts as long as my other one did.
"Five Stars, only one request to make it easier to exit full screen. 😉"
It is so easy to use. Books are easy to read and I carry it everywhere with me.
Great product
"Love it , everything I wanted in a kindle"
Great tablet from amazon love the new changes with HD and speed
I have two. One for each of us. We both love them!!
"This is my 3rd Kindle.  First was only for reading, 2nd was Kindle Fire which I really liked but did not have enough storage capacity so I got this Kindle Fire HD that has more storage than I'll need.  I have books and games on it and can use for anything I want on the internet. Great product!"
My third kindle and I have loved them all. Kindle support sucks but the device rocks.
Fantastic!😯
We have two kindle fires. The 7 and the 6. They will not connect to my WiFi and if I finally get them to connect it only lasts for a few minutes. I have tried everything to fix but nothing works. I will never buy another kindle fire... Amazon doesn't offer any help to fix the problem.
My old kindle was actually a better one.The speakers on this one stink.sound is distorted and fuzzy at best.It sounds as if the speakers were blown from the day I got it.it's a fourth generation and if I had to buy again I wouldn't.
I love my fire
So far so good.  Wanted a small reader that could also be used to access my e-mail and this looks like it will fill the bill.  Will be able to travel and leave my laptop at home.  Love that it has a USB port.
love it
"Bad assemble, barely works."
i lve this tablet. it was a little different to get used to but now I love it. Very clear screen. Nice to hold. Very Durable!
Cumbersome to use.  Ads pop up all the time.  Carousel hinders more than helps.  I like to use hard copy of instruction manuals but I cannot find a way to print one so ordered one.<br /><br />I think Amazon Prime is great.  The fire is an ok buy for the money.
"Just received Kindle Fire last week and still getting used to it and learning new things. But so far, it's great. This is my second Fire and my third Kindle and thoroughly love it. I am an avid reader and would rather read from my kindle than a book."
Great product but hard to find a good case
It's so much faster. It's screen is a bigger.
I love this device but tried so many times still can't get wechat installed on my kindle fire. Help!
I love it.
Love it!
Works great. Couldn't be happier with this!
i returned item
This is my 3rd kindle. I received it for my birthday!!! The first one I gave to my niece and nephew. The 2nd one I gave to my son. I love it! It does everything that I need and with the prime membership I have access to so many free things from movies to songs! The picture quality is dramatically improved from my first one and I carry it with me all of time. Kudos to Amazon and I can't wait for the next big upgrade!!!
love it
Not that great. I bought for my granddaughters as a replacement and not big enough always saying delete out of room.Plus I thought it was all black like there old ones don't care for the white.
💛💛💛
Gift for grandson and he loves it!
"My mother bought this and it started having problems 8 months after she bought it, well it quit working 8 days after the 1 year mark and they REFUSE to replace it (told us she has to pay for a replacement).  They said that they don't even fix their products...Why would you sell a product that you cannot repair.  Mom is on a fixed income and cannot afford to buy another one.  I have 4 different Kindle products at this moment and now will be getting rid of ALL of them and going to the Ipads (at least they fix their products)"
Great product.  Received earlier than expected.  Expect to enjoy it greatly
"I am in love with my Kindle! It never freezes,with my other tablet could not even copy and paste.So easy to use and learn.Turned right around and let my daughter get one to!"
I paid 157.00 after the price with shipping and it is already giving me problems and I have not even had the item for a week...the Kindle will not stop freezing and the screen keeps going black... I am started to think I received a refurbished item because I should not be having these problems with the device this soon
"I love this little unite so far, and has more than I thought it would"
Very limited number of apps. Reading books it's ok but not a great tablet for all of the choices available on other devices.
Exceeds all expectations!
just wish when you buy the kindle from a retailer you could see the settings to show your memory and version instead of having to go to amazon website
I have always loved the kindle fire and still do
"This was a gift for my birthday and it was a wonderful surprise. The tablet exceeded my expectations performance wise and I just can't get enough of it. I would recommend this to everyone, it's a must have."
Excellent
Love the upgrade.
It was a birthday gift and I love it
My 8 and 7 year old love their tablets!
"A very crisp clear picture, & sleek design.. Not as fast as an apple I pad  mini but great for all the things other than fast gaming..Fantastic price as well! I give it a 5 star plus."
"I love it but not user friendly.  I know the world likes going online for everything, I would prefer an owners manual and I would not mind paying extra for it."
I love it!!
great product although the battery doesn't last as long as I'd like.
Apps issue
Amazing!
Excellent
"Like , this is my third one"
It is a good product for the price. Good quality and a variety of features. Good for the entire family.
I loved the tablet better than the computer because of convenience
"Love it for the price. Works great, much cheaper than an iPad. Battery life could be a bit better but that is my only issue."
I love it! It does everything I need it to!
"I loved my first generation Kindle Fire for three years before I sadly had to lay it to rest, and the fault was entirely mine. In all that time the only problem I ever had was with the charger, which did not work unless I had it plugged in at a very specific angle. I called tech support and they sent me a new charger, free of charge, just to make sure it was the charger and not the device. The woman I spoke to was very helpful and it turned out the new charger worked fine so the original charger was defective, not my Kindle. Both my son and I loved playing games and reading books on the Kindle Fire and occasionally watching videos we downloaded. We used it on a daily basis and I was very sad when I broke it. I had taken it to an eye doctor appointment so I could read while I waited and that is where the accident happened. As I rolled the chair over to the glaucoma testing machine, my Kindle flew out of my lap and slammed into the metal base of the machine...I guess I was rolling a little too enthusiastically. The device appeared to be fine, the screen didn't even have a scratch on it, but when I turned it on all I had was a half blue/half black screen. I haven't called tech support because it was a great excuse for me to get the new, larger Kindle Fire I had been thinking about buying anyway. I don't understand the negative reviews of this product at all; if my Kindle can slam into the metal base of a machine and not break the screen, I have a hard time believing falling three feet on to grass or off the arm of the living room chair can break the screen. I suspect  the negative reviews are exaggerated by people upset at their own or their kid's clumsiness. I highly recommend the Kindle Fire, it is a great tablet for all of its many uses!"
I love Kindle! Works great!
"This is a great little tablet that we bought for one of our kids.<br /><br />As a parent, I really like the kid's options that Amazon provides (Amazon FreeTime) and the parental controls.<br /><br />I feel secure that they won't accidentally stumble on something we wouldn't want them to see with the tablet."
The camera is poor.  The downloads are easy.
This is the 4th Kindle that I have purchased in the past couple of years as gifts.  Great tablet.  I got this one for my sister and she loves it.
Great product for a very reasonable price.  I am amazed at all it can do.  I like the 7 inch screen for is more book-size for reading.  I can now look at magazines in color!  Thank you for developing such a wonderful gadget.
"Love it, I'm not a techie gal, but having pretty loaded with all my info was great."
There were a few features on my first Kindle Fire that I was unable to figure out on this one. It could be that I am not tech savvy.
"Got it for my wife, she spends a lot of time on it, so far no complaints.  Amazon on the special sales day had it for $79, I tried to purchase then bought there were problems trying to put it in my cart, contacted Amazon explained situation and they sold it to me at sales price. GREAT OUTFIT."
I'm having concerns about  the volumn  It goes all the down to a faint whisper after a short time in use. I'm going to use it to watch something at length and see if this continues.  If so I will return it for a new one. If this is necessary I will need a return label sent to me as I don't have a printer. Will be in touch.
This Kindle is so much better than the one I bought 3 years ago. It's so much faster! Advice: get more GB. I'm having to decide what to keep and let go off my device.
"I really like my fire HD 7! Luckily, I have not had one single issue with mine. I had a nook for many years and finally it started having problems. I hated to part with my nook because I had so many great books on it but I really wanted to try a kindle. I figured out how to download my nook books to my kindle and now I can read both my nook and kindle books anytime I want. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"
"Kindle has become my fav now, it is amazing for reading, browsing, movie. Only drawback I see is poor camera resolution but that's not its primary agenda anyways. This is a very good tablet for a low price."
This has amazing sound!!! The quality of this tablet is great!!! I love it alot more then I thought I would!! A great value!!!
Great
Great product
Love it so gar
More than I expected...startup was much easier than I expected.
This is my second Kindle fire.  Already own a generation 2 and bought this generation 4 as battery was getting old on my other one. Works great. Especially like the new location of control buttons. Much easier to use volume and on/off. Only negative issue is that this version does not permit use of a mini hdmi cable to connect Netflix to a television when traveling. Otherwise it is great. Use it more than my laptop as size is great.
"Disappointing, Android? Not really - Google Play etc. not available, no functional Instagram. Prime free books not what I hoped, works fine as a reader with Overdrive/library once I figured out not to download for Kindle, use epub. It was inexpensive on prime day, my expectations were not met though."
This is just awesome! It starts up pretty quickly compared to the laptop I have. It's so nice to just grab it when I want to look something up. Now I don't have to wait around for my laptop to start up.
Love it.  This is the fourth one I bought.  One for myself and three others for gifts.  After two years I had a problem with mine.  I called Amazon and they instructed me what to do and my problem was solved.
"I've had my Kindle 1 month, only use it s few times a week and it's already broken. Suddenly one day it no longer turned on. I tried the power hold button for 30s to reset and doesn't work. Charged for hours doesn't work. Wish I would have read more of the negative reviews for to see that this device isn't very reliable. Still waiting to hear back from Amazon to see if they will help fix the issue on my new device or not. Really bummed."
love it
"Don't bother. Every time you want to watch a video or a tv episode you will find that the app you need &#34;is not compatible&#34; with this device. Damned expensive for an e-reader, which is all you will be able to do with this."
"I loved my original fire, which I use to supplement the iPad if my husband is using it. With Amazon's July &#34;sale&#34;, I thought why not pick up another one as the original did start gradually getting laggy. I'm afraid it doesn't hold the same quality.  Poor battery life in comparison. Volume isn't as loud, and I don't care for the placement of the buttons. (Volume, on/off, etc) for the price, it's ok, but they've gone down in quality, and I don't expect it to last. Too bad my original requires frequent &#34;reboot&#34;. Doesn't compare to the iPad at all"
"I go tthis because my mother encouraged to get one. She knows me well. I ahve never been one not to love turning pages in of a book, but I will try and get to love it like my mom."
I would buy one wit more space. 8 GB is not enough even a two yr old (for whom it was bought)
Very happy with the new tablet. I had an original version and took advantage of the sale to order this!
Having lots of fun with this tablet. Colors are brilliant. Speakers are great. Overall couldn't be happier with it.
"It's a Kindle. It's 7&#34;. An it's in HD. What more is there to say? The Kindles are the best tablets for the money, and rival tablets that cost much more. I have 0 complaints. The white color is a nice touch."
"By far, my most disappointing purchase on Amazon ever.<br />I purchased this for my child, and tried to set up the &#34;teen&#34; profile.  The teen profile is slightly, if at all, different from the toddler profile.  So, if I want my child to actually USE the device, I have to set him/her up as an adult, thereby obtaining access to ALL of my content.<br />Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for touting what could be a terrific product as &#34;kid friendly&#34; when Freetime and Parental Controls are so obviously broken.<br />Parents of children over 9 - LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!"
Didn't like the picture quality of the cams..very basic cam..returned it within few days
"It's exactly what I wanted! I love the music, books and videos. So easy to use. Love it!"
I enjoy my kindle fire.
"Finally retired my old kindal, new 7 is awesome! !"
still learning to use it.. a bit more of a guide would be nice
"the advertisements keeps making the shopping icon show up on my carousel very annoying.<br />cant seem to turn off the locator that tracks you everywhere, an app turned it on and not i cant turn it off.<br /><br />Video quality is good"
Haven't really had time to play with it much
Excellent!!!
I bought my kindle fire. A couple of months ago.  I really like it. I have had no problems. So far. My only complaint  is. I wish the sub or charging cord. Was longer. Because I have this thing that I like to read while my tablets charging.
"I read somewhere that the Kindle ran on the Android OS.  So I bought it during the Prime Day sale.  They actually use a customized version of Android OS, which they call Fire, and will not get you most of the cool apps that a regular android tablet will get you.  Basically this was a waste of money for me and I am glad I paid the Prime Day price, which was the most disappointing sale ever!!"
"This is my fourth Kindle with the last three being Kindle Fires.  The first lasted 4+ years, but then I accidentally cracked the display.  My granddaughter is now the proud owner of the second.  I find I like to have two Kindles on hand, so I never have to be tethered to a charger while I try to quickly (and sometimes uncomfortably) read the last chapter of a good book.  The phone app is okay in a reading emergency, but I find it is not quite heavy enough to wake me up when it hits me in the face if I have fallen asleep while reading ;)  So, my newest Fire gets 5 stars because finally the designers were thinking like actual Kindle users by putting the power button at the top of the device instead of at the bottom where it was too easy to accidentally power cycle.  The charging port is at the top as well which is nice.  Otherwise, this device is pretty much the same as the last one.  Good job Amazon!"
It's a great little tablet. I'm very happy with it.
is exactly what it says it would be
Superb would be an understatement. Wish I had it years ago. Thanks a million.
"I have used this thing for about 7 months now, I got it as a late christmas present, and I love the thing, hoever, I do have some nitpicks, and they will be listed down below, but as far as performance for less than an iPad or a Surface, this is a pretty great performance tablet, probably thanks to Amazon's lightwieght  FireOS, as well as the quad core 1.4 GHZ (for those who arent tech savvy: a bigger number next to GHZ is better, means more speed) ARM processor, powered by snapdragon, I believe. now the nitpicks.<br /><br />1. when idling (screen off, charging, ETC.) it uses 80% of the 1 GB of ram that it has, leaving you 200MB to fart around with. (bigger number next to GB  is better as well. )<br /><br />2. No youtube/ google play services: while some may like this, and some may not, I do wish for google play services but, I also wish for amazon to keep it's current os look. HOWEVER: you can run .apks (android apps) on this device, as long as you're willing to accept that amazon WILL NOT HELP YOU should an android .apk causes internal system damage to your fire.<br /><br />3. keyboard lag: Remember the 200 MBs of RAM that you are left to fart around with? I forgot to factor in keyboard usage,  after keyboard usage, 100 MB, and this causes some slow downs, in terms of the keyboard, and some other amazon apps and services.<br /><br />and these are really the only complaints I have with the device, on the scale of dream about it, play with a store display unit, or buy it?  I recommend Buy It, but to each his/her own."
"Replaced an older Kindle fire, enjoy using the new Fire HD"
"Battery life is exceptional. Lasted through my flight from Iowa to Oregon. Screen is bright, even in sunlight."
Runs faster than my toshiba laptop thats for sure. And the sound is alot louder and crisp. I use it everyday.
Still discovering all the bells & whistles. Love it so far.
Unit locks up all of the time. Tech support asked that I use it for 10 days or so and see if it keeps doing it? Not satisfied at all with this product.
"excellent service, product works as described."
Who doesn't love the Fire!! Can do anything I ask it to do!
This was an anniversary gift and he loves it still. It's fast and efficient. Seems like it would be good for older kids as well
love it love it love it wanted one for years
"It just arrived- already charged.  I logged into my wifi then I set up my email, my Netflix, my Hulu, my HBOgo in minutes and I'm a moderately low tech person.  No problems.  I watched a few shows to check it out and was amazed that there were no problems- No weird &#34;WTH is happening?&#34; issues, and the viewing on the 7&#34; is so clear and crisp.  Great for taking on my vacation and to work so I don't miss my shows or emails.  Will have to play with it more for the other aps.  So glad they added the payment plan so I didn't feel guilty about buying it for myself. I wonder why they don't do the Amazon Prime as monthly payments like Hulu and Netflix?  I don't like the idea of repeating all-at-once big annual ACH that I might forget is going to hit my account so I haven't gone for the Prime even though I also have the Firestick for my TV and love that too."
so far so good - my first tablet and I enjoy ALL the features it has
Excellent product.
I am very happy with the tablets performance.
Had an original fire. New ones even better. Easy to navigate through and overall lovely.
Yes it did and am very happy.Still checking it out and learning about it ready to start ordering books again.
Love it way better than IPad
"It's ok, kind of slow when compared to other tablets.  The default user interface is actually easier to use than the child interface."
This is my econd Kindel Fire. The first one was damaged by accident and i wanted to get the same thing as I was very happy with it.
"This is my 2nd kindle. Compared to my other kindle fire hd I believe is a 2012 version. They are basically the same to use.  I have noticed that there are certain games only available on the newer version. I like that my kids cant get on and play my stuff, they can only access their profiles, without my password.  They moved the charging port to a better location.  This new kindle battery life is only 2.5 hrs until its drained of steady playing games and surfing the net. Graphics are better, more clear."
Very cool table and easy to use. The HD 7 meets all my expectations. Battery life is not the greatest.
"Good product. My problem: big hands, small keyboard. Desk top with standard keyboard and printer, although not portable, works best."
Perfect for what it's intended.
Nice! Love these things
Works grat for me!
"This is my second Kindle. I like downloading books to read. It is a great small tablet and I take it with me wherever I go. The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because the battery needs to be recharged more often than my previous Kindle, I recommend purchasing this product."
"My Fire HD 7&#34; HD Display. 8 GB<br /><br />Is all i had hoped for and more, i have had many hours of joy playing games and reading!  The price was excellant!  Thank you Amazon"
"tablet, great!  But the Amazon support is even better"
Slow download capacity. But the unit is pretty good. I haven't used the fire stick as I'm a prime guest not given the same perks as a prime account user. Have to pay for the movies
Nice picture and does the simple things I wanted it to do but a little heavy for my taste.  Samsung is lighter for a larger screen but quite a bit more pricey.
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Everyone in our family had the second generation Fire, but this one is even better!"
awesome and use it every day
Great!!!
Love my new Kindle!
Exactly as expected
I'm an apple lover. this is the first kindle....its hard to get used to. I didn't like that I had to pay to get the constant ads off!!! that was shocking. I like the screen for reading. I don't like that you can't personalize the screen saver.
I'm writing this review on my fire tablet right now!  It's a great little device. I mainly for it for reading but I was pleasantly surprised by just how much it could do. I really like how it came already plugged into my Amazon account also.  I would recommend this to friends and family. It'd be great to buy electronic versions of school books too.
Good reading device and easy to use
"All was great , Thanks"
I love my reader!
I like it
It was a gift from Elizabeth. She gave it to me with the receipt to return it. I wasn't so sure I'd want it: I have an ipad. I was thinking of getting a new paper white kindle and this Fire does exactly what I wanted and more. Amazingly is isn't just a dumb iPad imitation. I find I'm using it more than the iPad these days. go figure?
"Better than Samsung, sorry"
I love it.  The size is perfect. The processor is fast and the battery had a decent use time. Being used to Apple I'm having to learn how to navigate without all the apps I'm use to. But with Amazon prime music and videos I'm never bored.  I especially love the price point.
Its all I expected. The battery lasts forever. The selection of books is phenomenal. Great reader and internet access. Sound is great. Camera is awesome. Haven't found anything I don't like.  Worth every penny.
It's the greatest thing.
Charge not what I thought but it's still a good product
Love it
It my Christmas present this year. I love it
I don't know what I would do without my kindle!
"I previously had a Kindle Fire that I loved, however it was hard to read outside. I bought a new one because the Fire wouldn't charge anymore. The new HD reads well outside. It is lighter in weight. I am not yet used to the format and have a hard time moving from one app to another. Sometimes it seems to be &#34;frozen&#34; and I have to shut it down and restart it to change aps. All in all, I like the Fire HD but I am disappointed that my old Kindle Fire wouldn't charge anymore."
I have been using IPAD tablet for years and I am still staying and sticking with my IPAD in many aspects. Fire HD is cheaper and will be OK for reading but not for surfing the internet and other apps. It displays advertisement from Amazon which is annoying.
"My Kindle Fire HD 7 has been a user-friendly device that I particularly use for reading books that I purchase online for it.<br />While I'm not particularly a technological person, the Kindle makes my technology life simpler and less stressful."
Its nice and cheap but the app store is awful.  Amazon apps are awful they are missing very popular and important apps. Also you can't customize your kindle and they use your home screen as an advertisement space.
Bought it for the additional camera and photo app. Had ordered blue but received black.
I bought this for my mother. She is in the nursing home and loves to read. This is her 3rd Kindle and the best by far. It was so easy for her to learn how to use it!
"Wife loves this, a definite step up from using her cell phone to read her books"
"There is lots of new features that I like over my old one, like the charger is on top along with the turn on buttom (great) its thin and lighter (great) but I am haveing problems openning my apps some says error. I will go to my old Kindle and it works great."
Good book reader
"Lasted less than 2 years and because it was out of warranty Amazon did nothing. I will never buy another Amazon product again!!!!!!! I barely used it and it locked and would not turn back on. Oh yeah, forget about talking to someone who speaks English when trying to fix problem."
Just a bit different than my previous Kindle Fire but I have no issues at this time.
"Love my new kindle fire, really liked my first one like the newer improvements on this one"
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
"Very nice tablet...  MY daughter loves it.  I purchased the tablet during a special promotion at Best Buy, and it is the best tablet.  Previously, I purchased bargain tablets for the price, but the Fire is a much better tablet and worth the additional money."
I love my new Fire!!
"I've only had my  Kindle Fire HD7 for a few weeks, but I love it. The display is sharp and easy to read. I have not explored all the options available, I've been too busy reading. For the money, I think it is a really good investment."
Perfect size. Streams perfect. Easy to carry along. Big enough to watch videos. Excellent price.
"I have been slow learning how to use my new Fire because I am still using my Paper White to read books. I am writing this review on my Fire  as using the keyboard is easy with a stylus. I expect to get a lot of use and pleasure out of my Fire on long trips as I travel alone, it will be easier to travel with than my laptop."
Great product. Enjoy it immensely. Easy to use and read
"Unfortunately the 8GB is not going to be enough GB's for the amount of TV, Film and other uses I will have for the Tablet.  It is great for people who won't need to use the tablet as much as I will be using it.  I have ordered the Fire HD 7,7&#34; Wi-Fi, 16 GB and that is what I should have ordered first.  The picture is so clear and the sound is excellent.  I wish I could have given the one I returned to one of my children but they both have a tablet."
"I gave my old working Fire HD to my hubby and he is so enjoying reading on it.  I love, love my new kindle it works perfect and that cover with the key pad makes it even better.  Great deal - love Amazon!"
"I'm really enjoying the Fire HD 7(4th generation).  The tablet is nice looking and has an exceptionally vibrant screen.  I read comments about the OS not being a &#34;real&#34; Andriod, but I've been able to load(or side load) all of the apps I've been using on my iPhone. The only app I haven't managed to install that had caused some issues has been Google Play. A couple of the side loaded Google apps say they need it, but then the continue to function as normal. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't allow the loading of the Google apps, just to make the customer's life easier.  The tablet speed is quite adequate about 98% of the time, but on rare occasion things sort of stop, then catch back up.<br /><br />A couple of complaints.  I've only been using the Fire for roughly two weeks, but it does not seem to have overwhelming battery life.  If I use it a lot I would probably charge it daily.  One of the reasons I was replacing my Nook Color was that I had to charge it every 4 days. That's not a completely fair comparison as I'm doing much more on the Fire, but I had hoped the battery would last longer. I've installed utilities to give me some visibility into battery usage, but there doesn't seem to be much I can do to help other than possibly turn off the Wifi some, but that's not why you buy a tablet is it?<br /><br />Second complaint is about accessories.  I guess there is confusion about the various versions that are in some way a Kindle Fire 7, but not the HD 4th generation. I had a hard time finding a case locally, other than the odd one sold by Amazon, or generic cases with hooks on the side.  I ordered one from Amazon.com that was supposed to work, but turns out even though it said it was for my machine it really wasn't. I finally found a non-Prime seller that has a good, reasonable priced case, it just took a while. And unlike anything starting with an &#34;i&#34; or a Galaxy, it is hard to find accessories locally, and I live in a big town.<br /><br />I purchasedit on &#34;Prime Day&#34; for $79, and at that price the Fire 7 HD is an exceptional value.  Would I feel the same had I paid $139? I'm not sure. At full price I probably would have purchased the Nook Galaxy Note Tab 7, primarily because it has an SD slot."
The camera resolution is not very clear.
Very pleased. I needed the update.
"I like it, but it would be nice if it had a charge light like the fire so you know when it is done charging,and didn't have to turn it on."
"I'm only giving it a 4 because the battery runs down pretty fast and I read a lot.  Other than that, I love having easy access to books that are not available in paper form from the library, although I also miss touching library books other people have also read and enjoyed.  The low cost of ebooks is much appreciated.  It's nice to be able to adjust the light, and the background shade.  Also handy to have games like Sudoku, and the web, at your fingertips."
It is better than the original Kindle. The display is great<br />and the size is just perfect.
Easy to use and download books and apps.
"i never thought i would want or even like a kindle-but so far, as i'm playing around with it to see all it can do, i'm loving it!  i was finally able to get a hold of 6 books (which are in 3 different series that i love) and now i can also get Netflix!"
Perfect!
Great graphics and functionality
best thing ever
Interesting upgrade from old kindle fire. Wish it did not have ads.
wife loves it
Love it!
I love the kindle had and so does my family<br />!
Love the pink color. My only complaint is Amazon Apps don't have the same apps as Play and ITunes. I almost returned it for an Andriod but I really wanted this for the Kindle reading and screen glare.
"I love the tablet, it 's ease of use is unparalleled.  My only problem is with the camera.  The photos are terrible.  My granddaughter loves the games."
"Just love my kindle!  Meets all my needs, yes I wish it had instagram, or snap chat app but oh well."
"I enjoy my first Kindle Fire (2013) so much I ordered the 2014 version - replete with camera.  Very nice, but I wish it had more memory.  We are turning into quite the Amazon family - 2 Kindle Fires, 1 Paperwhite and 1 Fire phone - but all are in use and very much liked."
Very disappointed in the charging process.  It holds a full charge for 5 hours but runs down the battery whether in use or not.  Will be plugged in all day/night and still not be charged.  Will just show the low battery symbol.  Very frustrated with this.
I love this tablet.  Well worth the money.
Love this but it's a little small
I got this during the Amazon one day sale. For the $79 price it is a pretty good purchase. After having it for a month it died. I couldnt even factory reset and had to get a replacement. Amazon handled the replacement great and the new unit came in 2 days. As an e-reader this works great. However to be more of a tablet it left me desiring more. I like that there is an extensive library of ebooks. I like that I can search web if I want but I think I will go for a more robust tablet.
Excellent product......meets my expectations!!!!
I love this tablet it is the perfect size
ok
"I bought the Fire HD 7 on Prime day for a good price.  My 5 year old daughter uses it for her Barbie dress up games and enjoys it.  I'm not disappointed in my purchase for that reason as it was a cheap way to free up our iPad.  If I paid more, I likely would feel different.  I still use it from time to time for shopping, YouTube, etc.  I always end up putting it aside and getting the iPad as it just doesn't work as nicely in my opinion.  I keep giving it another chance, but still prefer my iPad mini.  The battery life is the most disappointing.  It always needs charged.  It would lose the battery race by a long shot to our iPad mini."
i am enjoying my new Kindle so far. I have read a couple of books. I am still in the process of learning.
"this is my 4th Kindle, and my second fire. My first was the simple one, my second got left on a plane (sob) I preordered the kindle Fire HD 7 and it was worth the wait. Recently my screen cracked. I called amazon to see if it could be repaired. I had no idea it was still under warranty, so imagine my surprise when they said they would send a replacement. amazing! I love my kindle Fire HD. It is worth every penny. Not only can I read anytime, anywhere, but I can play games, surf the web, watch movies. I can do it all. Best, Tablet EVER!"
"Easy to use, lots of options and nice picture quality"
I did not like Fire HD 7 at all. My old Kindle is much better that is why I sent it back.
"I love my Kindle Fire HD 7!  I had the previous version, but like this one better.  It's great to be able to take pictures with it.  It is the perfect size!"
Like it.
"Loved this tablet until I found out that you can't share downloaded prime instant videos on a child's profile.  the only way for the chd to watch prime videos is through the parent profile.  very inconvenient and not thrilled I'm paying for prime and can't allow child to watch videos on long car rides.<br />UPDATE:<br /> Had to go down to two stars:  An update that came out a few months ago made it so that whenever you turn on the tablet it automatically boots to the parent profile.  Before the update it would automatically load whichever profile was loaded when it shut down.  This change is causing a good deal of frustration with the toddler who used to be able to power it on and get into his profile with very little assistance.<br />Also, I purchased the full version of some preschool apps, but they cannot be used in the child's profile because it does not allow for in-app purchases.  While Amazon was willing to refund my money for the apps, their first response was to allow the child to use the apps in the parent's profile.  I felt that defeated the purpose of parental controls.  My husband and I use a Samsung tablet.  When we upgrade our tablet we're going to give our old one to the kids because the Samsung Kid's Mode app is more user-friendly--it allows in-app purchases to be used in Kid's mode and if the tablet shuts down in kid's mode, it reboots in kid's mode."
"I'm a bit disappointed.  The price was great, but I've had issues with the touch (it doesn't recognize touch sometimes), games freeze after playing them for a while, and I was surprised to see that some games aren't compatible with the device."
"I was very disappointed in this device. The device has one advertisement after another.  This was apparent even when checking my email. The ads were so intrusive and they most likely contributed to the slow loading of pages. I used this device once, and knew this was a fail."
"Loving my new Kindle. Great graphics, much better sound. Very easy - ready to use."
Great kindle fire.
Still learning.
"It works well overall. Great for use as a kindle and for basic surfing. If you're in need of a tablet for reading, note taking, and basic web surfing that isn't as large or expensive as an iPad, this is a great alternative. I've had mine for a couple weeks now. The processor is definitely a bit slower than an iPad, but it still gets the job done. The amazon store is missing some basic apps though, which is a bit disappointing. The wifi on my device also has some issues disconnecting often (I'm not experiencing this with any other devices, so I know it's not the network).  However, I'd recommend to someone in the market for a cheaper iPad alternative."
"Got it for 90 bucks on cyber Monday and I think it is great! Watching movies, reading books on Kindle, side loading apps, etc... And though it only has 16gb of space I for one am not an app crazed young person, so it fits my needs! The battery is average but charges pretty fast. It is the &#34;sponsored ads&#34; version but that is only on the locked screen so no biggie. And I bought it for when I'm at home so only needed the wifi version.<br /><br />You just need to remember when you buy a mobile device is, does it fit your needs? Because when you have a smartphone, a home computer AND a tablet then buying the most expensive  top of the line product becomes redundant and unnecessary. This is not saying that my Fire HD is isn't good. In fact it is great! And it fits in with my needs! Buy it and I guarantee you'll be very pleased!"
can't wait till x-mas I think my son will luv this
It gives me everything I could possibly want great books amazing movies and the pictures are SO clear thank you so much for the amazing things you make this tablet do for me it's really put some spring in my life!!😊
You lose so much when moving from Android Tablet. Never again.
I love the weight of this Kindle. But it keeps stalling and I end up with a black screen. The only thing I can do is restart. The charger does not stay in the hole on the Kindle.  They tried to make it do too much
my wife loves it
This is very slow. Likes to freeze up. Would not buy one. Won this in a raffle. I will be sticking with the I pad.
Have not read one book yet.
"For the price the Kindle HD 7 and the 6 are hard to beat. Good picture on movies and a good touch response. I still like my iPad, but for the price this is as good!"
"the Fire HD 7 is very nice, but the directions for use that came with it are terrible for someone that has no idea how to use it. Is there somewhere to get information o how to use it? Need help."
"Worst Kindle I've ever owned! I've had this kindle replaced 3 times now. Fortunately, it was still under warranty. One of the replacements I was sent worked fine for a couple of days and then it just wouldn't turn on at all! Customer service was very helpful and they quickly sent me a replacement....3 times. This final replacement they sent me still has issues with going blank.  I'll just stick to my older kindle."
"The kindle itself works well and has many apps that you can use, but Amazon prime gives you horrible movies and music that you haven't even heard of before. The wifi barely ever works, in my experience, even when it says that you're connected."
"I finally bought a Kindle. The tablet that I'd been using would freeze regularly as tablets do and was particularly frustrating when I was reading a book. When other apps froze, I could switch to my phone but I didn't like reading on that small screen. The Kindle is perfect.  Not only do I use it to read, but I also put printer and docs apps on it. It syncs with my calendar on other devices. (I'd heard I'd be busier after I'd retired and it has proven to be true! I really need that calendar with me all the time.) It's perfect for reading while I'm on the treadmill at the gym - easily fits in my purse. I followed the instructions to run down the battery monthly. The camera works well, too. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could."
"I have had 3 kindles, bought this new one a week ago. Nothing worked right. Goes to a blank screen, skips pages, have to power off to try to bring screen back up. They are sending me a new one , hope its better. If not ,I will buy I Pad Mini."
"Fire HD 7&#34; is user friendly, and you're getting a lot of bang for your buck."
"Difficult to hold, no way to stand up"
I love my new kindle
wonderful item.. fast shipping
Im giving this as a gift. Im sure the other person will enjoy.
LOVE IT!
As usual it's wonderful
Works fine. I don't know what people in<br />the other reviews are complaining about with the pixel sizes/ resolution. I have excellent eyesight and I can't tell a difference. Screen has excellent display...
It was a birthday gift!  Everyone here is enjoying it.  Very easy to use!
"Nice for surfing the web, just wish it had more memory."
Replaced my first gen kindle. It can always use improvement so 4 stars.<br /><br />My one major complaint is it doesn't dim enough. I'm not sure why they don't give us the full range of dimming. I have been using the Screen Dim app with some success. It tends to conflict at times with other apps. But it has allowed me to use this kindle to read in the dark without getting a headache.<br /><br />It's got a nice screen. Much improved from the first of it's kind. I know for a fact this won't be my last kindle. It's much loved.
"I had expected this to have 4G, but I can only use it when I'm within Wi-Fi range."
"It was everything i wanted and more. Amazing tablet and even better price. Had to wait a month to get it after ordered, that was the only minus.  But great performance and desing."
"I like having a Kindle to read and get online, but I was really disappointed to find that regular Android apps don't work on it (you have to do complicated workarounds, which is really frustrating) and mine is pretty slow to turn on. Overall, I wish I would have gotten an iPad."
"I am impressed, this our fourth kindle in our family, and it was as easy to set up as the rest!"
My daughter absolutely loves it!!
My second fire.  Absolutely love kindles.
Happy with this product....thank you!
Love it!!!
I bought it for my dad. He loves it :)
very pleased. met all my expections.
Works great and is easy to use
I've had the tablet for a few months now and have just started to really get used to it. Sometimes I find it laggy and a little slow. I also am disappointed that the App Store doesn't have as much as the Google Play store. Really wish I could use my Google Play account and apps on the Fire. But overall the tablet is good. Just a few things that will need some getting used to.
Great...!
Was very excited to receive my new Kindle ahead of schedule!
"It works fine, but I find the &#34;offers&#34; as disconcerting. This replaces my original Kindle Fire. I find I liked the old one better."
"Got this on the fire sale July 15, and even though we had to wait about a month to get it, what a DEAL!  Nice quality, we're very happy to have it.  Looks and is exactly as described in ad and by any person you've ever known that has one."
It's a great tablet for the price. Both my kids love it. The only set back is the battery drains very quickly!!
Love it!  Will order another one.  My husband took it :)
"I purchased this Kindle to take on a trip to the beach.  When I reached my destination I couldn't connect to the internet to download my books.  When I returned home everything downloaded fine.  It was the fault of the internet server, not the Kindle.  I'm very pleased with my Fire HD 7."
It's my second kindle .
"I take it everywhere, it does everything I need it to.  Books, games web surfing, the hd quality is great."
Great
"Bought for the 5 year old granddaughter...She loves it! (And I get to use my own, unless she forgets to bring hers along!)"
This product was easy to setup easy to use. It is as good as they say it is very happy with it. I browse the internet do email good product
"Exactly what I wanted, very happy with my Fire HD"
"Love my new Kindle Fire 7<br />I do a lot of reading and I bought the KF7 to purchase books that I want to read and study that I do not have to have in hard copy. This way I can take a library with me when I am on the go.<br />Was not sure about how I would like the small screen for watching Netflix but it turned out just find, the convenience of the device outweighed the size issue in my book (pardon the intended pun)"
"The only thing I'd change is that I would get more memory. If you like music AND ebooks AND a couple of games, there's not enough to hold it all at 8G. Other than that, I'm happy with it."
"Wonderfully designed Kindle. I use it in place of almost all of my paper books at this point. The screen is plenty big and the interface is intuitive and easy to use.<br /><br />My only mini complaint is that I can't tell the Kindle to specify a language translation dictionary as the default. I'm trying to learn French, and it would be nice to be able to set the English - French dictionary as the default to use when highlighting a word in a French book. It currently uses a normal French dictionary, which is fine, but this would be a nice feature to have as well.<br /><br />Overall, yet another great product by Amazon."
I love it works great as t for my needs !!!!
"Battery discharges quickly..operating system has problems on a weekly basis.  After one year, just throw away!  Just buy something better."
I am really enjoying my HD 7 .... just the right size to carry around .  The pictures are very clear --easy to see and read .
"I loved my gen. 1 kindle, but this one is 100 times better."
"I was not pleased. I have 3rd generation Kindle Fire and love it but needed more GB so ordered this newer one. The app I NEEDED to have , Moon Reader, which I have on the older version is impossible to download on this newer Fire. I expected more and am so disappointed, would like to return and exchange for a Google Nexus."
"A nice tablet for the price. The apps available in Amazon are limited but it works well for what I use it for, which is reading online and streaming music to my stereo via Bluetooth."
"The Fire HD 7 is compact and has a great display. Very handy for email, Facebook and Web surfing."
Even better than expected . Very pleased with purchase.
"Nice for the price. Next time I would probably pay more for more memory and to eliminate the annoying ads. Otherwise, enjoying using it."
Great my 3rd fire!!!
"The crisp clear display on the fire hd is super, better than my iPadI was pleasantly surprised!"
The picture is no where near as good as I expected. It definitely should not be called HD. The battery is not good either. Even when I am just reading the battery drains really quickly. An hour of reading drains the battery by at least 40%. I bought the 16 GB version and it moves really slow and lags. I am extremely disappointed- I wish I would have just saved up another $100 and gotten a better tablet.
Great deal. Love it.
Exceeded my expectations.  Much faster than my LG Tablet with better HD.
"Over the past few years I've purchased one of these for for just about every one in my family . This one is for me . I like the front and rear cameras and I believe that this version is quicker and easier to use than gen. 2 &3 that I purchased before . My only advice for prospective buyers is that while 8 G is fine for a reader and surfer if you intend to use for video or music storage you should get the 16 or 32 G version . It is , however , perfect as a help in Bible class .With the Bible app. you can find references with great speed ."
"4.5 Stars - Outstanding value, great picture, no visible hesitation in performance during regular use or streaming video, easy to navigate, ability to not only read books purchased on Amazon but easily read ePUB books with the Overdrive application.<br /><br />Detailed review: I had the original Fire Tablet. I won't go into details, but it was an all around disappointing experience. I replaced it with an Asus tablet and a Kindle Paper white, both of which I continue to use today. I still had a technological hole in my heart,  wanting a smaller, more portable tablet to read ePub books and for light surfing, Facebook and Pinterest. I purchased the HD 7 during the July 2015 sale, and for a tablet? I consider it a steel.<br /><br />Pros: Great picture, intuitive set up, performs well during regular use, light surfing, and streaming video, provides me a smaller, lighter tablet for reading ePub books, easy to switch between applications.<br /><br />Cons:  The battery life is just OK. Limited applications - they still make it difficult to load android apps that aren't specifically marketed through Amazon. Shopping on Amazon using Silk and the 7&#34; screen is not easy.  I usually revert back to my Asus tablet or a PC. It's a bit heavy to carry around in a purse.<br /><br />In closure: it is a great little device for the money, but until it can fully integrate with the rest of the android world (play store), it will be relegated to reading and light surfing."
Love it
I have had this tablet since November 2014. I loved it at first but starting about three months ago I have had nothing but problems with the tablet freezing on me. They have replaced it now two more times but continue to have the same problem. Very very frustrating!!!!
"I have an older fire, bought this one for the camera, I shouldn't have.  Camera is not very good, the pictures are not very crisp.  Struggles in anything but perfect lighting.  Highlights are too white and low light gets grainy quick.  Often fail especially are just blurry washout.Tablet works fine, does everything my other fire does.  The case feels cheaper than my old kindle."
I loved the camera on it  and everything about it.
"I guess I didn't read the description clearly.  I expected a slight bigger screen and a black tablet. The kindle is great however. Sometimes it's a but slow, but otherwise it's great."
Love it!!
"Loved my first one.  This one frequently freezes, blacks out, and sometimes will not work at all.  I have had it ready to take back to point of purchase and tried it again only to have it start up again.  Not impressed with this model."
Great product
Grandson loves it!!
Ever since Amazon started using the new people to go thru for returns or breakage. I am sorry to say they no longer stand behind there products.
This is the first time I ever buy a kindle fire tablet and so far it's amazing. Wish it had more memory though
Absolutely love this ordered for my 2 yr old who couldn't stop grabbing older sisters.  It is great for the lil ones
"Much improved over the original Kindle Fire, which had a lot of bugs when navigating the web. Very fast and nice screen."
I was very disappointed that I can not see the screen outside. I thought it was the same screen as a Kindle.
"Great color, among many attributes"
"First tablet for me, so I don't have any baseline for comparison.  I am enjoying my experience so far!"
"cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job."
This item was a gift from my daughter and I am thrilled with it. I love to read but I can do so much more as I am still learning.
From the recipient:  My wife gave it to me. didn't particularly want it but glad I have it!
This Kindle is perfect for my reading pleasure. I purchased at reduced price during Prime Day.  It arrived in excellent condition.  I did have  difficult time syncing with my other Kindle books.  But a customer rep was very helpful and we did get it working.  I still know that I can be doing much more with it and will experiment in the next coming weeks.
"appstore is pretty small, compared to usaual market on android... :("
"Was better than I expected,and did way more than my old kindle,"
Very good.
Good
"I received my kindle fire 7.7HD and found that I could not use a headset.  I was getting no audio through the set.  I checked the ear buds and they work fine with my old Kindle.  I contacted customer service and the made arrangements to send me another Kindle.  I sent back the damaged Kindle.  I received the new Kindle on Friday 8/21 and the earbuds only work on one side.  I don't get audio on both sides, also the picture keeps flipping around.  Now I am very unhappy with the new Kindle and will be contacting customer service to return the Kindle and get credit for my purchase.  Before you send out a replacement I would think you would check that everything is working .  I have been dealing with Amazon for a few years and never had any trouble before.  I hope you will be able to correct this problem.  Marian S.Kindle"
"I ended up getting the Fire HD because I dropped my old kindle and broke the display. I experienced issues with turning it on and getting a blank screen, finishing a book and it freezing. I was restarting it multiple times a day. I was very annoyed and seriously considering paying to get my old kindle fixed because I had no issues with it. Then I looked into the features to see if anything was causing the issue and saw there was a special offers feature. I turned that off but it sent me an email saying it was charging me money to turn something off that I did not want in the first place. I was not happy about that but have yet to see if appear on my statement. Since I turned it off I have not had any further issues and have thoroughly enjoyed my new kindle which is why I can give it a 4 but not the full 5 due to the issues mentioned above."
"Piece of s***.  Charger is flawed.  This should be recalled.  Let's a spade a shovel shall we gentleman.<br />What has happened to.Amazon's customer service????  Once beyond excellent, it is now garbage.  Wha Happan Amozon?"
when I am reading a book it freezes on me. Then I Have to power down to unfreeze it.
I hate this product
Met and exceeded all expectations.
It works like my old one but better.
So far I love it...
Kids love it
Bought the Fire HD 7 during the black Christmas in July sale for 88.32 out the door. It was worth that price for sure. Love the size. All my favorite apps are available.
"had problem with the first two , they send me a thirdone so far doing  great Amazon tean help was greate helping me solve the problem."
"Bought for 9 year old son. super tough, loud speakers, good battery life. When i said tough, i mean this thing is dam impressive."
"After Using this for several months now, I'm beginning to get use to it.  However, there is still more I have to learn.  But overall I like it very much.  This was a great gift."
My Mom loved this as a gift!!!!
Love this Kindle!  It has everything I need and I really am enjoying all the free apps!
"I have purchased 5 Fire 7, 7&#34; Hd display tablets as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren as well as for myself in a variety of colors. I have personalized each one and have purchased a variety of colorful cases to make each tablet their own. I have also downloaded apps for each tablet so that when Christmas arrives, each of their tablets will have age appropriate apps and will be be ready for use. Although 8 GB is not a lot of space because some of the space is taken up by the system itself, apps can be removed and replaced with new ones. The Fire tablet offers parental controls which will prevent children from watching adult content. Love that feature. As for myself, I will use it for work and leisure and have downloaded some adult games such as solitaire and Tetris."
I now have 4 different units and like them all
The moment I took it out of the box it started lagging. it was thick but the battery life said otherwise. Did not meet my expectations. It also does not run android...
Awesome tablet
"Very happy,  My husband has had one for quite sometime and we both enjoy them"
Nifty little tablet for a great price.
i have the old fire 7&#34; and somethings on it are better.  the off switch is better located and the off button color shows it being off.<br />otherwise the fire hd 7 is good.
The battery dies twice as quick already. I have only had the product for about 5 months. Not quite what i expected.
I absolutely love it. Perfect for me!
"I`m still learning about the different features and apps. I`m a bit overwhelmed, but definetley impressed, and it`s every the manufacture said it would be and then some. I hope to add to this review at a later date."
"I really liked the ability to read without additional lighting. I dwnlded games which are right on the home page. Turning it on is slow and then I have to tap on books and tap on the book I am reading. which takes more time.Would really be nice if the book I was reading was on the front page,tap it and go straight to the page I left off."
"This is my first Kindle Reader and so far I enjoy it.  I'm &#34;electronically challenged&#34;, but I found this device pretty simple to operate.  My plan is to use it for reading novels, pretty much exclusively."
Love the HD 7 it is fast and easy to use.
great
Love it .  So does one of my daughters and we have just touched the tip of the iceberg.
Fun little pad. Great screen resolution.
"3rd kindle, have upgraded every few years. Very pleased with this larest version."
I love it. It's thin and light it is very clear screen.
Loving it
Excellent!
slow slow and slow
"This new tablet is a lot sleeker and faster.  Gotta give Amazon credit on that.  The main complaint is the fact they do not allow Google apps to be installed.  Google offers so many functional apps, that could turn this tablet into a computer.  Instead, this tablet only seems to be useful for games and books.  This may be a cheap tablet, but there is no value, since you cannot use it like a computer.  You might as well but the Google tablet, and then it's 2 for the price of one.  I am being you Amazon, please support Google apps, or allow this tablet to integrate with the Google Play store.  I will no longer invest in the tablets until that happens."
like the flexability to view  were i want around the house
"Got this for my husband.  He's on it a lot, so I guess it is working out just fine."
Love this tablet. Wish it had Bluetooth.
Tremendous tablet!
we sent two back before getting one that worked
Battery seems to die faster.and seems thicker and heavier.
It is extremely difficult to remove all air bubbles from the anti glare shields when applying to kindle fire.
"in less than 20 minutes (with no apps running) my battery went from 100% to 80%. I called kindle support for assistance and NO ONE in customer service was able to assist.  I updated the screensaver, brightness, and battery options...nothing worked.  You can't close apps without forcing the apps closed. WORST.PRODUCT.EVER"
Love it
I was looking for a replacement for my first generation Kindle. My old one wouldn't show pictures well. This new one  the screen is perfect for colors and any videos. Email and any Apps work seamlessly also... I am still leaning what else it can do. I find the reading very easy on the eyes and the font size can be changed.  It has a lot of &#34;bells and whistles&#34; which I am tweaking to my liking.
Amazon AppStore is to limited.  I wish Fire HD would come with google play store installed or allow google play store to be installed on it.
"This device is very good for what I want. It's my second one as my grandson latched onto my first one and he watches a lot of kid stuff on it. So, I thought i'd just get another one."
"Defective. All kind of hassle replacing. Service people very nice though maybe ill informed of procedures. Finally figured out? Though still a problem in listening to customer needs so again I will have contact service again today, 5th time not so good for long standing Amazon customer."
"I have been very disappointed with this kindle. I purchased 2 kindle fire hd 7,7. Both have similar problems. They randomly freeze, restart, and shut down. Also difficulty with the power button, kindle will not turn on. I have an older kindle fire hd that doesn't have any of those issues."
"Since receiving my Kindle from Amazon only last week, I can so far say I am more then pleased with it.  If there are any negatives to report I have yet to deal with them.  It will be perfect to travel with containing all my favorite apps and remove the necessity of lugging my laptop around.  I don't think it will be great for reading at the beach but I still have my nook for that.  I'm sure I am going to enjoy this little machine!"
"It is no good.  You cannot read a book outside, and that is what I use my old one for.  Also confusing to use."
What a great joy to have all my favorite Authors at my fingertips.  And access to internet....  great buy
"Don't like this one half as much as the earlier generation.  The screen keeps going off a few seconds after turning on if you don't respond to it, so you have to wait around for it to boot up or you start over again.  A lot of the new &#34;improvements&#34; aren't intuitive or helpful, like the volume control  buttons on the rim.<br /><br />They force you to buy a whole new case for this version because the buttons are in different places. I wish I could've kept my older one forever, but the batteries wear out in these things and can't be replaced.  How convenient.  Technology is this advanced but they can't figure out how to replace/fix a battery for these devices.  Thanks for being crafty-greedy, Amazon.<br /><br />I've been a loyal Amazon customer for years and have never been disappointed, until now."
can't seem to change amazon accounts... annoying
"I love my fire HD 7,7&#34;HD tablet it is the best tablet that i have it is better than any tablet that i have."
Battery life is terrible.
Works great
not as intuitive as I thought or maybe I'm just use to IPAD. Battery life not great if watching movies from amazon prime.
I am enjoying it greatly!  It was a gift.  I am so amazed at all it can do!  I highly recommend it to everyone looking to buy a tablet!
"Great product, but it does take a bit of time to adjust to. Coming from iOS, some of the displays aren't intuitive, like the home screen that shows only some of the apps unless you select one of the categories from the top and the carousel, which I believe shows you the most recent used apps but shows me books, too. I wish there was a way to categorize apps within the home screen, because it's quite messy. Silk is not my favorite browser, and I don't like how I have to go to the homes screen to check something on another app (i.e- Goodreads) and then have to return to Silk to search, if that makes sense. Essentially, I think there needs to be an easier way to toggle between apps. However, the Kindle does it's job, so no big deal."
Very disappointed in the apps available.  This tablet needs to be rootable.  This would be 5 stars if I could get the google store on here.  Please let me know any info on rooting kindle.
"I love it!!  My awesome lil sister sent me this as a birthday gift.  I can't thank her enough!!<br />I am an avid book reader, so this is really sweet to bring with me where ever I go.<br />Love the colors on the screen and the games are fun too.<br />Can do so much with it, email, take pictures, FB, and shop.....just to mention a few."
I think it is great - wish I got a bigger size.
Great price. It was a gift for a 10 year old and she Loves it!!!!
"It's lighter than my original Kindle Fire, which is good for my hands.  There are some things I am unable to get, such as google hangouts.  The on/off button is a bit irritating; it is almost level with the surrounding case therefore making it hard to access.  It's quite beautiful, and the graphics are vibrant and colorful.  This is my third kindle and it just keeps getting better."
it's marvolous!
Great!
"Its the best. Screen is awesome when watching Movies, the audio is outstanding."
"Absolutely awful product.<br />the day I got it and charged it, all I could get was a black screen that gave 2 options:<br />a) reboot<br />b) reset to factory defaults<br />I tried both, nothing worked.<br />called Amazon, they sent me a replacement.<br /><br />then the SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED AGAIN.<br /><br />Two Kindle Fires, brand new out of the box, neither worked.<br />I won't be trying a 3rd time."
I was kinda leary about going to a new Kindle. But glad I made the change. I really like it. It is easier to use than the First Generation Kindle.
"My grandson was forever wanting my Kindle, he preferred it over his DS. He just had his eighth birthday so I purchased this one for him. He listens to music, plays games and reads books. He loves it and I enjoy not having to share mine."
Love Kindle
Love it!!
Excellent product - love the screen size and clear pictures. Easy to navigate and to many available apps to count.
"I was very excited at the purchase on the amazon anniversary, but have been pretty disappointed with the battery life and system. Its good enough for what I paid, but would probably not recommend it."
So far appears to exceed my expectations  still<br />Learning what it can<br />Do and what the limits are and still exploring it
"Low storage capacity, poor camera, feels like cheap plastic compared to my KindleFire.  The one good thing is that the keyboard is more usable. Was not worth the price"
This is my first tablet. It has exceeded my expectations. It is easy to use and has many more functions than I thought it would. Other plusses are the size and weight both of which make it extremely portable.
is the best. so happy with it
I think it's ridiculous that you can't sign out of your e-mail account! I also would have liked to get the color I wanted without having all the ads.
"I've had a Nook for several years and have always been pleased with its performance, but my new Kindle Fire out performs the Nook. I especially like the front and rear cameras and being able to record a video."
"It's a very good product!  Easy learning curve, a cheaper alternative to other tablets.  I approve!"
Great purchase.  Wonderful upgrade from my basic Kindle.  Couldn't be happier!
All that I expected it to be
8GB is too small. Get something bigger.
Very nice... I really don't like all the ads and marketing.. Is there a way to turn that off?  I'd rate it higher if there wasn't ads polluting my screen every time I woke up my device.
Have to charge battery much more often.  Not as user friendly as the kindle fire.  Harder to figure out how to do certain functions.
"I bought the tablet to stream video to my TV.  I have a new TV with a Chromecast.  I have been streaming with my phone, but it is annoying, when a call comes in to try to answer the phone and pause the streaming video. By the time I have brought up the video and paused it, the phone has stopped ringing and I have to call the person back.  I was streaming from Amazon Prime with no trouble with my phone, but the tablet, which I assumed would be easier, if anything, is not compatible with the Chromecast.  I have tried for hours and cannot download a simple Chromecast app to the tablet.  It does not recognize the Chromecast on my TV, so the tablet is useless for streaming.  I also have Webroot software to provide security for my laptop, desktop and phone, and I cannot get it to recognize the Fire tablet.  Apparently, Amazon has gone to such extremes to be proprietary, that it does not work with any other system or device.  I am very seriously considering sending it back.  I have worked to get the Webroot and Chromecast on the tablet for 2 hours today and am to frustrated to continue.  I will probably try again before I return it."
It only lasted about 2 or 3 months before the screen blacked out.
Excellent
"i will NEVER buy another amazon kindle, fire, etc. product ever again ... not only was i transferred about 10 different times to people, NO ONE COULD HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM ... my kindle fire still won't work and the person who i last spoke with said Amazon couldn't replace it ... meanwhile its Amazons fault that my device is having the problem!!! i usually always buy amazon products and now I'm not so sure i will ever purchase from them again ..."
Love it!!
I have enjoyed it from the moment it carried
Not impressed.  I have a Kindle that is about five years old that is way better than this one.  I bought this because the battery in my original is starting to fade a lot sooner that it used to.  The battery on this one is worse than my older kindle.  I regret buying it.
"I had a regular kindle that I wore out. I was afraid the Fire HD 7 wasn't going to be as good as advertised , but it surpassed all my expectations. I have recommended it to all my friends."
love it
I really like it so far!!
"While I purchased this tablet for a very attractive price and I think it does some functions very well I am disappointed by some aspects of the tablet. First it does have advertising when you turn it on, that itself is not a big deal, but the fact that several Android apps don't work on the device is a true impact on me. In particular the lack of support for google chrome is a real deal breaker for me. If you are looking for a device to consumer amazon content this tablet will do a nice job at a very attractive cost. If you want a generalized android tablet you will disappointed and I think there are better alternative for less than $50 more."
"I'm glad I purchased this, still learning what it can do."
Love it
"antiglare protector screen does not work well, the millions of free songs never seem to be the ones I want... my taste runs to the classic rock 70's and 80's and there is a cost to almost every selection I made... movies same story.  I will probably cancel Amazon Prime for the same reason  if my experience doesn't change in the next few weeks.  Otherwise the hardware is everything I expected."
"Overall its a good tablet.<br /><br />Cons: if you use google or one of its competitors, it will slow and lagging."
was so used to my previous Kindle which allowed me to have all my unread books on the carousel and all read books in favorites.  LOVED this feature. Wish it was on this Fire HD7
Requires additional $15e fee to remove ads from lock screen.
fits perfect.  Love the color.  Not to heavy.
Its great
Love it!!!!!
Both my husband and I love the Kindle Fire.
"the screen freezes often.  It does not always go to the last page you read, sometimes it resets back to the beginning of the book."
I already had a KIndle but wanted another so that I would not have to wait for a &#34;charge&#34; in order to keep reading.  The second Kindle has been the greatest thing!!! No more waiting----just switch to the second Kindle and keep reading.  My only problem has been &#34;kicking myself&#34; for waiting so long get the second one!
"Received the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; yesterday. Easy to set up, user-friendly, great screen quality. But I do have several issues. A: Amazon, your app store is deplorable! All the apps I really want I can only find on Google play, but Google play doesn't work with Kindle. So, you have to either sideload it or live without it. Amazon should really do something about that. B: I thought that I could mirror my screen to my TV. Only works with Kindle HDX. I like to watch tv shows from other countries in my browser and hoped I could fling on the big screen. Doesn't work. Kindle HD has a front and back facing camera but lousy quality. I would consider a HDX 7&#34;, but it only has a front facing camera. Is it that hard to put a front and rear facing camera on a device that costs almost $ 300?. Not sure yet if I will keep it. It's not much of an upgrade from my previous Kindle HD."
Gets what I Want done so no complaints here.
"For the price I purchased it during Prime day, and being my 1st tablet.  I think it was a great purchase, just wish i had gotten a better case for it."
"Very disappointed coming from a nook tablet. I hate the ads on the lock screen, it's not very customizable, and the screen is ridiculous. It's so shiny, I mostly just see my own reflection, not whats on the screen."
"I love my Kindle Fire HD 7. So far, no complaints."
Very good. Like a otter box for kendal
really like this
"I've had this tablet/reader for about 3 months.  I bought it to replace a Nexus 7 (original gen) that was getting on in years.  That was a mistake.  The Fire HD 7, while providing a nice screen, is very frustrating to deal with when you're coming from a more versatile system.  To be clear, the only things I really do on these devices is: 1) read books; 2) watch movies/shows on channel specific or general apps like Hulu, Netflix, Showtime, etc.; 3) occasionally browse the web; and 4) occasionally play games.  For these simple purposes, the Fire is okay, but barely.  Because it's a closed system, you can only download apps from Amazon, who doesn't have the full complement of apps available on Google Play.  You can root the Fire, but that's way more work than should be necessary for something like this.<br /><br />Then there's the battery life, which is horrible.  I now rarely use the Fire because it always needs to be charged.  I can have it fully charged, read something on it for 30 minutes, put it down for a day, and come back to find it's out of juice.  My old Nexus 7 doesn't even eat battery like that!  That makes this thing an occasional device to use after my Nexus runs down.  Added to that, despite its use of the universal Micro USB, it only seems to charge on its own cord, which makes meet think it's poorly constructed to boot.<br /><br />Bottom line: I regret wasting my money on this and will not be buying again, or recommending to anyone else to purchase unless it's super cheap."
"I have read two novels on this device and I am very  happy with it.  I have previously used the large Kindle and iPad for reading, but really do prefer the Fire HD."
The fire hd is great i will use this one for books other one for music so they are both great
This product is awesome  with a very reasonable price.  Its a pleasure to use as well as convenient.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves to read.
"We had to take it back to best buy. We have owned two others, this one went bad within one week. Very disapointed."
I don't like all the advertising for Amazon.
I would like to have more apps available. The device was easy to use and the sound when playing music is great.
"My life has completely been changed, and for the better!  This was a gift (am I allowed to say that?) from a wonderful friend, and a total surprise!  I am now able to take pictures, videos, I have downloaded a lot of my favorite music, I have watched 2 movies, I've read several books on it, I check my email and face book - all with this wonderful, magical device!  I seriously don't know how I ever lived without it!  My favorite thing is that I have been able to download the Bible onto it!!!  There is a handy way to look up scriptures - sort of like a table of contents - it takes me right to the chapter and verse I'm looking for.  I can't rave enough about this.  Consider this a smiley face!!!"
my wife is very happy with her fire
I Gave this to my Niece to have.<br />I had no Idea it was Pre-Loaded with my Amazon information to be able to Download and BUY Apps.<br />Now I have to find away to get my personal Info. OFF the Kindle.
"Bought for my wife. It was the only good deal they had on Prime Day. She loves it! Now, I can have my Galaxy Tab back!"
"I saw the 6&#34; Kindle fire and thought it was a bit to small, so I ordered the 7&#34; screen to my surprise it was bigger than I expected (I know it's only 7&#34;).  I was even more surprised of it's quality, it was heavy and the picture quality was better than most 7&#34; tablets. The speakers sound is extremely clear and very loud for its size. Overall for its size I'm more than impressed with my new Fire HD 7. I LOVE IT"
Great product!! Would give it a five if the battery lasted longer!!
love it except photos crashes all the time
"Love it - perfect size and weight.  I dropped my 3-year old Kindle e-reader and didn't want to replace it with another e-reader.  So I picked this Fire up during one of the promotions. I use it mostly as an e-reader, but the kids use it for games, learning apps and movies."
"I love this kindle, I check my emails watch movies and play games."
"It's the best!!  I bring it with me on my commutes to work and have grown quite addicted to it.  Haven't used the  camera yet but, WOW!<br />It has a camera??!!  I love my Kindle!"
Great buy! Still have a lot to learn
"One of those products that reminds you of the saying, 'You get what you pay for!'. Its not very responsive, app store is limited, and I get spammed by all sortsa &#34;unknown sources&#34; apps trying to download on my device. Sometimes I have had to restart the device coz its acting too slow on loading/switching apps. And I am only 2 days into using this."
Quality and performance is very clear.
battery life is terrible...other than that it is nice.
Wish I bought two of these on Prime day.
"Still learning how to use it. Easy to navigate, however, sometimes you inadvertently hit the wrong area which changes what you were doing or looking at. When starting the free games a pop up often appears wanting to take you to an app either for free or for purchase of new game. Some free card games run out of coins and you get the offer to purchase additional coins, not what I had in mind for the free card games. It does offer a beautiful display and ease for reading your e-mail and checking Facebook."
This is the best tablet that I have seen for this size. The price was a lot less than I expected. I enjoy reading the great books I get from amazon on this tablet.<br />I would highly recommend this product.. this is my second one.
"This is my first tablet so I'm not exactly knowledgeable about how it should work. But so far, I absolutely love it!  I've downloaded tons of music (Prime membership) and simply love enjoying music from my youth anytime I want to!  If there is a negative, I'd say it doesn't seem to hold a charge very long.  And I don't keep it on all the time so it would be worse if I did."
"I am happy with many of the features the Fire HD has to offer. It can be temperamental at times. When I am on Facebook, it will not open stories that I would like to read. I am still learning all the features it has to offer."
Excellent!! Just what I wanted.
This my third purchase of a kindle fire. That speaks for  itself.
Love it! Replaces an orginal Fire which I have had since they first came out. Have an 8.9&#34; HDX for most uses but the 7&#34; HD is best for reading in bed as it is smaller and lighter to hold .
"I love the Kindle, this is the 9th one I have bought. I have gotten them for grandkids, nephews niece and even one for the girl I work with child. Ever time you buy the kid an educational toy it costs you $30.00, ten of these toy is $300, and that does even cover the things needed to run them. Once you get the Kindle app are so cheap or free .Also the Kindle grow wit the kid.  I gave given them to 3. year olds but know that he can be using it when he is 69 like me"
"I'm very excited about that high definition, however it's so much slower than my old fire that I can only give it three stars ."
Love it! Hasn't left my hand :)
Like this Kindle was Lil smaller than I thought would be. I still like my 3rd Kindle best. The biggest
"Love it, watched a movie on it and the picture was so clear."
"I haven't had much time to spend on it, still learning features, etc.  I like the size and weight."
"I thought it would be just as good or better than my old kindle 7, but it's disappointing, it freezes @ the picture quality on the camera is very poor. Movies the picture isn't nearly as good as my last kindle."
"Ok, this is going to be an unashamed great review on this product! I researched tablets for my sons as they had specifically saved up to each buy a tablet. After checking on price, game availability, apps, etc, we settled on this tablet. We bought two, one in black and one in blue.  They play on them, read on them, take pictures and make funny edits on the photos on them. In the time we have had them, they have been played on everywhere and taken on numerous trips with us. Yes, this is worth the money. Yes, this product is durable."
"Overall really good.... Doesn't replace my iPad, but does a lot and let's me use more of my prime and kindle services."
I like it the graphic are nice. I still do not know how to totally use it. I am so glad I purchased this.
Purchased the Fire HD for reading books.  It is wonderful.
Item was exactly what I ordered. It works great.
I love my kindle. It's my second one. My first one only had the front facing camera. This one has both front and back and I love it!  For the price you can't go wrong. I would recommend this one.
Works great. Glad I waited for the 16GB; the extra space is a must when being shared amongst multiple people.
It is so much better than the old kindle.....
"Love, love, love this for reading books. I still use my laptop for shopping and reading the news, but will eventually change because the Fire HD has an excellent display. I can now read without having to hold the book and without bending my neck, which is important to me because of painful bulging discs in both my cervical and thoracic spine. I have been using it in an old book holder I bought one of my sons when they were in college, and it is the perfect solution to not having to bend my neck for long periods of time. ."
Bought for a 10 year old & he LOvES it!!
Love it!!
"Totally disappointed in the Kindle Fire.  There's NO access to the Android Play Store, and mediocre selection of apps available through Amazon.  I knew there was no play store, but I figured I'd just be able to side load it (no go), or that the Amazon app store would be comparable to Google Play.  Additionally, the battery life on the tab is meh, and there's no sd card slot (which wasn't a requirement, but it would've been nice).  As a reader, it's good, but as a tablet if fails miserably."
Couldn't get all the app I excepted..sorry!
I love it so much
love my kindle.
Very pleased with the clear resolution and colors.
Really enjoying all it's amenities.
Great tablet for my son.
Excellent entertainment device. Good price and plenty to keep the kids busy.
Best birthday gift ever!
I love my kindle
I have had a Kindle fire since the first generation and have LOVED it! Only reason I got a new one (after 5+ years) was that I wasn't able to charge it anymore (the charging port got kinda lucy-goosy) The resolution on the new one is incredible!!!!
My children love it.
"II am truly enjoying exploring new things with my new fire,"
works great
Worth every dollar. My son loves it!
Great devise but it has a crack .
The magnetic opening and closing the Fire HD7 is very convenient
"I love the Kindle Fire for my own use (reading books, using apps, etc) but it is NOT very user friendly for kids. We have two iPads and our kids can operate them without problem. My biggest complaint is that after you finish watching a purchased TV show or video, it goes back to the store listing all of the episodes available to buy. I wish that screen was not as easy to access. Also, the screen has quite a bit of glare when reading books.<br /><br />However, the battery life and price beat an iPad by far!!"
This has great graphics and plenty of great aps available at the ap store. I love my new Kindle Fire! (When i can get my teenager to let go of it.)
I love it !!!!!😍😍😍😍
So far so good.
"Easy to operate, excellent graphics."
it's fine
"I purchased it over a month ago for my 8 year old. I like the Free Time app which I used to restrict apps etc that he can can access. The graphics are not as fluid as the iPad mini but good enough. Touch screen is responsive and speakers are loud. Battery life could be better, I don't think we are getting 8 hours of battery life.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I got it for $80 much less than all the other tablets (Notion Ink, Asus Transformer, iPad 2, iPad mini) I had bought before it. All these other tablets were at least 5 times more than Fire HD 7."
"happy I purchased this item, great product."
"Love it, now that I have it talking to me in English. I had to spend a few hours waiting for customer service to get back to me, but it'a all good now."
"When listening to a book & playing a game, games glitch.  16GB. Only have had it 12. Once it froze."
Love it! Exactly what we were looking for!
"I absolutely love my Kindle, but having a couple of issues since getting it a couple of weeks ago. Otherwise, I absolutely love it!!"
Broke in 3 months. Wouldn't charge then froze and just stopped working altogether. Really disappointed as I bought this as a gift.
"Once you learn how to use it, it's very user friendly."
"I love this thing. Held off on buying a Kindle for years and ended up getting one for me and one of my mom when they were on sale. Jeez these things are great to read on, it's so great to be able to buy books again without paperbacks outpacing your living space."
Items in cloud no easily downloaded.
All that I expected . You did a great job and delivered on time.
The Kindle Fire HD 7 in the magenta looks and feels amazing and the wife loves it.  She is able to read all her books and more on it and she likes the light weight feel compared to her iPad.  The only downside was that we bought the Kindle during the Prime Event in July and did not get the Kindle until middle of August.  Amazon should prepare better when putting on big sales like that.
"This is fine. I don't like all the advertisements.  App advertisements pull up before I have gotten off the home screen. That really annoys me.  I also don't like that when you are watching a show on it, the picture doesn't fill the whole screen. I did get the extras on it and that is nice.  I thought that the free time would come free for a year, but it is only a month.  I guess that is fine though. I do like that I get unlimited cloud space. That is a great extra. I haven't taken advantage of any of the other things it has to offer.  I will be excited to check out the books when things in life slow down a little.  It is fine for the $100.00 I paid for it, but I would never buy it for the $160.00 is usually runs for."
I love it
"Best tablet, best price.  Excellent sound quality, graphics, and versatility.  We got these on sale for a fantastic price.  The whole family has been extremely happy with this.  We can't recommend it more."
So far so good but i wish i could change the background or lock screen wall paper. Perhaps there is a way but no guidance for tips and tricks on making the tablet your own.<br /><br />Other than that I'm pretty happy foe the moment.
I love my Kindle.  My first was a Christmas gift from my daughter that got stolen.  I immediately ordered another.  Great product.
Very happy with it.
This morning I woke up to my Kindle Fire suddenly not turning on or charging.  Conveniently 3 days after the 1 month warranty coverage.  I have never even taken my Kindle outside of my house.  I literally use it at night in my bed and then place it on my nightstand.  There is no way that this device was damaged other than already sold to me defective.  I was on the fence about buying one and it took me months to finally make the decision and I regret it wholly.  Please do not waste your money on this item.  I have a Samsung Tablet that has been through you know what and back and still works perfect.  I will be buying another one of those as my first one has been taken over by my children.  So disappointing to have spent my money on this item.
just awful. I saw it only had 1 port so I chatted with Amazon before I bought it. They said I needed an hmdi to connect to the TV. Well no problem. I already have an HMDI for the old kindle fire. But noooo.... I need a different HMDI and that HMDI cable is 24.99 and has awful reviews. So this is going back. I will be gentle with my old kindle and hope they put the feature back in.
Love it
Size is perfect.  Love not having to pull out a laptop.  Great to read on or search the internet.
It's a great tablet. Very budget-friendly and it will do most anything you needed to do when it comes to surfing the web and checking your email. If you do a lot of reading this is definitely the way to go.
Purchased this for my 13 year old and she loves this. i messed with it and its easy to use. Setup was simple and easy to follow.
Love it
"I bought this because my 2013 Kindle HD 7 with 32GB RAM crashed.  The Amazon Tech told me do a Hard Boot and I held the power for 20 seconds, release and turned it on. Garbage screen and nothing.so I was transferred to 2nd tier tech support. She did nothing but sell me THIS Kindle with 8GB RAM.  It came with a 2015 version of a book i already had.  The book said Kindle have problems if you let the batteries too low.  The book said to WAIT 10 seconds.  I tried that and the Startup screen looked no better than before. I had it plugged into my Windows 7 pc.  A short time later I opened the case and it was NORMAL.  Amazon Tech did not tell me to WAIT 10 seconds. The keyboard on the new Kindle is hard to use. It is smaller but has more functions.  My first kindle IS dead But it's content CAN be accessed by my PC.  So what I now own is a new Kindle HD 7 AND a 22GB Flash drive. Slower because it is Android."
I love my kindle!!!
"The tablet looks nice and works okay.<br /><br />The browser is good enough for light browsing.  Although I have found that the browser has been incompatible with a few things (relatively rare, but has happened) like the Southwest Airlines in-flight wifi.  If you fly southwest often, don't expect to be able to watch TV,<br /><br />My main complaint is that there are ads all over this machine.  While it's in sleep mode, in the apps, in the browser.  This can get very annoying as sometimes they cover necessary buttons within apps and it's just very strange to have bought a machine only to be bombarded with advertisements after the fact.<br /><br />It is cheap and relatively easy to use, so for someone who doesn't use a tablet often or extensively, it's perfect.<br /><br />Just beware that you will be advertised to CONSTANTLY and it does not run on an apple or android operating system, so there can be some incompatibilities."
Awesome tablet
mom loved it
music crystal clear.  Loads fast.  like lightening.  Powers down fast.  Beautiful pictures.  awesome.
"For your watching entertainment, see amazon"
This is an easy and intuitive device.  It exceeded all of our expectations
"A nice tablet for the money. I have one that I keep in my guest bedroom for guests to use and keep one in our vacation home. You can watch video, read a book, play a game, whatever you need to do. The only thing that is really lacking is that there isn't access to the Google Play store  which has a far superior list of apps"
"Love to own one, if it goes on sale let me ."
It's ok I don't have access to as many apps as I thought I would so I'm disappointed about that. I wish it came with word processor and a keyword so I didn't have to lung my laptop everywhere to do my homework. I also think adobe should be able to get downloaded.
👍👍👍
This is my daughter's Kindle.  She moved up from a 2nd gen.  Loves being able to have the HD capabilities!  Although she is still hoping for a laptop for school I know this will get her through some of her classes.
Freezes up and has to be shut down way too often. Kinda a bummer.
Absolute junk.  It would not charge.  I got a replacement that doesn't hold a charge.  Now I have been charged for two kindle that are worthless.
I love my Fire!
Ut was a wonderful gift.  Thanks for having this Kindle at such a great  price.
Great little pad for watching movies. Charge holds for a long time
it does what it is supposed to do. nothing fancy.
This was a replacement Kindle for my daughter for one that was broken. However it keeps shutting down for no reason every couple of days. Seems to be an issue with the newer Kindle fire as my personal kindle was doing the same as well
"This newest version is not as good as the previous kindle fire I own. About half of the time I try to swop the screen to open it, the screen come back blank. I have to reboot the kindle just to get it working again. It's extremely frustrating."
"I bought this during Prime Day because of the discounted price.  I wanted a tablet that would fit into my purse to use primarily for reading.  I do also use other apps on this.  The only thing that is a little weird (mainly because I also have an iPad) is that anything that has been downloaded to the fire shows up in the middle of the screen.  I found it weird when I downloaded movies to watch while traveling (even rentals that had already been watched and passed the 2 day rental still were in the middle of the screen).<br /><br />Other than that, I love it!"
"Don't care for the special offers--recommend paying extra for offer-free version! Otherwise, great, quality product. Purchased as a gift for 3-year-old to play educational games and he enjoys it."
"No match for other tablets, but okay for a $99 one. Apps are incredibly lacking- no browsers have been developed for the Fire beyond the Amazon one provided, which is riddled with issues. Many many many times my home screen becomes unresponsive and I have to restart my tablet. Silk browser needs updates so badly."
"ETA: I've had this thing for about a month now and I'm not impressed. The ads at the beginning of the lock screen are still very annoying, but now the lock screen will randomly pop up when I'm reading and decide to change the way I'm holding the tablet. Also it has locked up on me several times requiring that I restart it. There is no way to cancel any of the programs that are running, or any sort of master control.   I would not buy this again and suggest no one else purchase it either. You're better off using the kindle app  rather than the actual kindle.  I like the book suggestions, but that does not make up for the crashing and slow loading. Seriously though, the ads are super annoying and I don't understand why not people aren't complaining about them. Amazon fail.   So far this is a pretty awesome tablet/e-reader. However, every time you turn it on, there is an ad for something for sale at Amazon.com. yeah yeah, I get that it's an Amazon product, but seriously, it feels like they're shoving it down our throats. Boo Amazon."
Great tablet at a great price.
Love it
Love it.
"The color is almost purple. YouTube app is a link port to the YouTube website that works well, but isn't the YouTube app. Clear, good sound, high quality picture that's great for movies. I didn't buy it for productivity and so far I'm very happy with it. 4 stars because I don't like purple"
"It is nice device but we have found the battery life to be inferior. It seems to only last a few hours and we have tried to adjust settings but it just doesn't seem to make a difference. Maybe we got one that is defective because it says the battery should last 8 hours or so but ours doesn't and we have to charge it daily even when not using it as it discharges fairly quickly.<br />If anyone has any suggestions, we would love to hear them. thanks."
daughter loves it hard to get it back from her.
The processor is fast. Intuitive. Graphics are outstanding!
It made my exceptation and some. I didn't realize it did everything it does. I had a ball adding all my apps and getting to know it.
"This is my third Kindle Fire and although I loved the first two, I am not as happy with this one.  This one was a gift!  These devices are not cheap, nor are the books, so I don't think I should have to look at ads on my tablet.  The person who bought this for me, should not have had to pay extra to not have ads on it.  It is MY device not Amazon's.  Several times the ads have even frozen up my tablet, which requires an inconvenient and time consuming reboot.  If I was using a free Kindle app, I could understand the placement of ads, but not on my paid-for device. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth every time I use it and has ruined the experience for me."
"Do not buy this product. I've had it since November 2014. The screen cracked today. I called into Amazon, and was told that they would not replace or fix my Kindle Fire. I asked them why does the commercial say that the Kindle Fire can withstand G-Forces, but not a drop of less than 2 feet. When I told the representative, Melissa, that, she got smart with me. I asked to speak to her manager, and she said that she could not contact a manager, but she could contact a supervisor. (Same thing.) When the manager, Ryan, got on the phone, he apologized that my screen was cracked, but he would still not replace or fix my Kindle Fire. We asked for his supervisor, and were told Jeff Bezos, but they had no way of contacting him. I've had this Kindle Fire for less than a year. This is the first thing to happen to it. I do not believe that they should state that the Kindle Fire can withstand G-Forces, when obviously it cannot. I am very disappointed not only with Amazon's response, but with the attitude of the phone representatives. I was never informed that there was an accident insurance plan, but I wouldn't have been, since they are all third party. (I also wouldn't have thought to buy one, since they are supposed to be able to withstand G-forces.)"
"I guess my problem with the Fire was that I was comparing it to my iPad. I didn't buy this to be a high powered unit, bought it mainly for reading and for that purpose it's more than capable.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the mail feature and that could be greatly improved. I have Comcast mail and even though I set it up to delete my mail from the server when I delete the mail on the Fire this doesn't work on any level. Also, even after I download my mail to my laptop (which then deletes the mail on the server), the mail is still on the Fire and it doesn't have the option of deleting all the mail, which makes it a pain to have to go in and check each email individually in order to delete them from the inbox. If these improvements were made, or the Xfinity mail app was available on the Fire, I would change my rating, but I don't see that happening any time soon.<br /><br />Overall, the screen resolution is more than adequate and now that I've used it for a little over a week, I'm getting used to it's idiosyncrasies and liking it a bit more, but it will never replace my iPad. Another problem I'm finding (and I only have 2 games on it) is that there is a delay when playing that is extremely frustrating. Good thing I really only wanted this to do mainly reading."
"The kindle fire HD is a good device, however there are certain pitfalls that should be looked at for the next generation and things to know<br /><br />-Hardware: (good) The hardware of the kindle is good enough to perform the functions, however sometimes switching between apps or trying to navigate it can feel sluggish. Logging on from the lock screen is also sluggish where after i put in my pass pin there is a good 1 second lag where i am often unsure if there was an &#34;enter&#34; or &#34;ok&#34; button i forgot to press. Performance within apps are no problem, once an app is loaded it runs smoothly from books, to games, to movies.<br /><br />-Battery: (Fair) battery is tied to hardware but warrants its own section Battery life leaves much to be desired, my daughter plays on apps and watches videos (too young to read yet) and the battery will last for ~4-5 hours, which is plenty if you are using it in the house but if you are going to be flying then it can fall a little short sometimes.<br /><br />-Kindle operating system (OS): (Excellent/poor):<br /><br />-- Part 1 [main system]: (poor) it doesn't run like anything that most people are used to. I have used and am very comfortable with both iOS (apple) and Android. the main idea with those is to have a few apps on the bottom with a library in the middle. the kindle makes it different where there are large &#34;recent history&#34; apps which side scroll in the middle. then on the bottom there is another row of &#34;favorites&#34; on the bottom. with a swipe up from the bottom tray you can access all of the apps you choose to have there, (like a hidden home screen). The search function is also mainly geared towards finding things on amazon and makes anything that is on the store come up first.<br /><br />--Part 2 [Free time]: (Excellent) this is the main reason i purchased the kindle, this way i could give it to my daughter and not have to worry about her getting into system files or getting into anything that sheshouldn't be seeing as well as making it easy for her to grow with the best parental controls offered without competition. This combined with an easily buyable foam case makes this by far the most toddler/child/kid friendly.<br />****one downside of free time that i have found; is that you cannot give the &#34;free time&#34; app access to your uploaded videos; i wanted to give my daughter access to some movies that i had on my computer, i uploaded them to the device but you can not give the freetime app access to those videos. i suppose it has to do with the fact that videos cannot be categorized so they don't give it access or if it is just overlooked because many people don't know how to directly upload videos to the devices.<br /><br />App store: (Fair): This is another possible weakness of the kindle; the reason being is that there are not as many apps available for the kindles as as the google play store or the apple app stores. One thing to note is that the kindle operating system is much newer than android and apple so this is normal. just like not that long ago there were more apps for apple than android, however today that is reversed. Currently there are not as many apps that i want to put for my daughter (kindle only has endless alphabet, where android and apple have all 3 endless alphabet, words, numbers)<br /><br />overview: I really like the kindle fire that I purchased, it is a great tablet that my daughter can grow into and use for years to come without me constantly looking over her shoulder or locking her in and out of specific apps (iOS guided access). There are many things that amazon can improve, however it is a great system for kids and for reading.<br /><br />*Caution; if you are looking for a tablet to organize your life with productivity/organization apps, i highly recommend you look some place else. the kindle is EXCELLENT for kids, and parental controls."
"I have an original Kindle Fire and this new model is a huge improvement. It's light, with an incredible display."
"I purchased this on Prime Day for a discount and am very happy with it. I had a previous generation 8 GB one that i enjoyed, but this has better resolution. The battery life is slightly less than the old Kindle, but it allows me to stream video for 2 - 3 hours before recharging and lasts all day for email, web-surfing. I like the wake/sleep function by the camera."
Great device!  Meets all my expectations!
"awesome!, reasonably priced, reliable, and great hardware"
"my great grand daughter loves it, and so do I"
Having a hard time using free movies in Guatemala City
It's awesome I love it
Love it
First I cUt root my device second on Minecraft the ip for my wifi doesn't work some reason and third why not add Google play?
"Love it!! The ad is only when it is turned on. Not intrusive at all. Not so worried now that I didn't spend the extra money on ad free. Vibrant images, easy to use."
"Although I had to wait 3 weeks for this little guy, I have been impressed with how it is. So far I have watched videos, taken pictures, and use prime to watch some movies on here. This is just the right size to not only carry around but to watch videos without too much hassle to hold on to it. All in all love it!"
"Provides you with a very nice reading experience I have to say. And can be used just like any regular tablet, meaning you can go on the Internet, watch videos, Skype etc etc. Don't hesitate!"
Nice electronic.  Fast shipping.
"Paid $80 for it on deal of the day type of thing. Great for a general purpose tablet. Would have been nice to have memory card slot, but not a deal breaker for me. Serves my basic need."
Just what I hoped for.
I love it I can take this with me in my purse and don't have to fuss with a big bulky laptop
"Learning all of its features Love it so far…wanted it for taking on trips, and sitting in Doctor's offices..."
No google apps. To dependent on amazon app store with limited apps.
"I've had this for only a month and have had a LOT of problems with it.  It reboots randomly.  Half of the time my books won't open, or they close immediately.  It won't sync (over wi-fi at home) from my Kindle to my phone, or vice versa, despite having it set up that way.  It will even regress to chapters earlier, and won't save my bookmarks.<br /><br />We had an HDX that worked great, which is why I purchased this one on the July 15th Amazon sale.  I wonder if they sold defective ones for that discounted price.  Supremely disappointed."
Great product after reading some reviews I was really not sure what to expect but really it seems more like people aren't happy unless they are complaining as I have not had any problems at all with the device itself or any of the games or apps that I like to use
"In the past I would have leaned heavily on the iPad (I currently have an iPhone and an iPad myself) but due to cost and also risk of one of the kids losing a tablet and/or it becoming broken, I find the Kindle Fire a great alternative if not even better for a child in general. I set up a profile for them and can then decide what specific books, apps, etc. that I want them to have access to. There is one little quirk in which sometimes application which I have downloaded on my profile and selected on my child's profile will appear on the child profile but they don't have access to them (an 'x' is present in the icon). I'm sure I will work through this as it has only happened on a couple of apps. Other than that there have been no issues with the Kindle so far and my kid has been thoroughly enjoying it!"
"I won this in a drawing at the library.  I did not expect it to be as nice as it was.  As my husband needed one, I gave it to him.  I now wish I would have kept it.  My husband is very happy with it so in the long run, I'm glad he has it.  If I were to get another one,  I definitely would consider this Fire."
"I ordered this on Prime Day, July 15, 2015. And I didn't recieve it until August 11, 2015. Twenty seven days later... I would understand that since it was Prime Day it could possibly take more than the two days guaranteed shipping promised to Prime Members but I didn't expect it to take 27 days long. Being a Prime Member and having to wait that long is disappointing because the member ship fee isn't exactly cheap. The thing that makes me wonder is why did Amazon have a claim queue for the Fire HD 7 during prime day, making you think they had enough stock of this tablet at the discounted price just to tell me the next day after I ordered it that it wasn't in stock. So they oversold items that they didn't have in stock. I wanted this to arrive in time so that my girlfriend could use it for her trip to Europe but I wasn't able give it to her in time. I am usually happy with Amazon service but this was very disappointing thus the one star.<br /><br />Now about the tablet. It is a good size for traveling and being on the go. I put the Netflix app on it and it runs smoothly and the picture and sound is very good. It's a very good tablet for traveling thus why I wanted it for my girlfriend for her travels. You can download books and read on it and it seems to do that very well."
"As a tablet, it's great, with one nasty little caveat: the battery life is full-on horrible and it can run itself down to nothing in the course of being left idle for 48 hours.<br /><br />So as usual alas it's a great idea...with horrible execution around the place it was easy to save a buck. It makes me sad but what are you gonna do? It's okay for the price but the point of a tablet is not being chained to the wall."
Does everything that an Apple iPad would do! Very happy! Especially since I really wanted it to read books on but a bonus because I get to play my favorite apps and browse the Internet when I need too
Constantly freezes and must be shutdown to resolve. Would not buy again.
Great little device and very easy to use.
I used it like I use my old kindle which did not have a camera and I get more bang for my buck. This one gets full to fast and you can not ad no more stuff. Yet all I was adding was the same stuff my old one had on it. It got full so if I was to buy this one I would buy the 16 and not the 8. Cause the 8 is not worth it.
I bought this tablet for my son and so far has performed to expectations.
"Great, can do a lot more on the fire hd 7, display and screen easy to read,love it"
"I'm very highly, greatly disappointed and irritated to find that the child profiles do not allow a parent to add the  Amazon Instant Video app to the profile.  This was the main reason I bought this device!  I'm tempted to return the device and bite the bullet for a second iPad Mini!"
A good one to buy.
"So far so good.  This was for  the kids to be able to read and study on.  Of course they also do some playing on it, but they've been very happy so far."
It's  great
This the more st undurible tablet n the world don't even want your money informed it 6inches off the ground and the screen shattered what the f*** Amazon talk about false advertising
Its a kindle so I knew I was getting a great product. and recived a great deal when amazon ran a sale. its self explainery its a kindle backed by amazon. i have baught 4 kindles and i have never had a problem with them. keep up the great work and quality amazon
Was happy with the way my replacement was handled. Thank you so much.
"I didn't realize the tablet took up so much of the memory. I didn't think the advertisements would use up a lot either.  After only installing a hand full of apps, we are almost out of memory. Not cool. How can we get more? There is no slot for a memory card. Disappointed for sure."
"Love it, grandkids play on it until the battery needs charging"
Super deal on 7/15 daughter loves it.
Cannot read it outside.
"My first tablet and the playability, diversity of apps and the reading availability through Amazon exceeds what I expected. It is a good companion to have with me."
"Nice size, in my smallish hands.<br />Easy user interface.<br />I quickly learned to return to the home screen when I was done using an application ... otherwise it drains the battery.<br />I'm still learning about it, playing with it, learning how to customize it to my needs and wants."
I gave this to my son who is a Marine.  He started using it right way.  It works wonderful for him to watch movies and he is able to get books in seconds after reading the reviews.  It is perfect.  He is able to take it anywhere he goes.  Only issue is now my daughter wants to upgrade her Kindle..she wants the cameras too. :)
Love my HD 7!
Excellent great price
"I just my new kindle , it is so easy to take pictures and send to face book . Love all the free games also"
Internet Access is the best I have seen in a tablet.
"it's a kindle fire! It is a good value and usually works well, though it does occasionally freeze up and need to be rebooted. I will keep my reader because I tend to read books all in one sitting and the fire battery won't hold up for that. But I got it on a great deal and am very pleased with it."
This seems to lose charge faster than I would expect. I had a super old kindle fire and it held charge much longer than this.
I purchased the Fire HD 7 for my mother. It was just the right size for her to hold and carry with her. The screen is clear. The kids especially love the camera feature. She never knows who's going to pop up on her screen! Great buy!
"I received the Fire HD 7 as a birthday gift from a friend.  I had never used a tablet before.  I'm still getting used to the features.  But I love that I can search the web, read e-mails, listen to music, etc.  I find it to be very user-friendly.  I would purchase this for someone in the future."
"I purchased the Kindle Fire, 8GB thinking I would have more storage than I did with my previous item, but was confused when I looked at the on-device storage and it only added up to 5.05 GB. When I called customer service, I was told that the other 3 GB are used on pre-installed software that I can't get rid of. It would have been nice to have been told this ahead of time, or at least given the option as to what &#34;pre-installed&#34; software came with the device."
I just love my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
Very nice updates.
It's my son's First Real Tablet (as he calls it). Love the set up for parental controls. Battery holds up well and my kids love it!
Works great. Very pleased.
I love the Bluetooth feature
"My last one would not turn on, so am glad to have a new one."
None
"I purchased these for my kids. However, it appears 8GB is not much. It would be nice if we could add a sds card or something to increase the memory."
This is handy to have! Fast and speedy delivery.
Love it!
"Lags a bit.  But all in all, good for movie watching and kindle book reading.  Not quite a web browser tablet."
"Absolutely don't like this tablet. I has good speed, a nice book reader, good front and rear cameras and crisp movie viewing but NO personalization allowed. Every time you open the case and wake up the tablet you are greeted with an Amazon commercial. You can't set a personalized desktop image or even a lock screen image (at least the Fire Phone allows you to do that). I HATE not being permitted to customize and personalize my devices. I'm already looking for something better to replace this. Guess I can use it to entertain my grandkids when I get something better for myself."
"I bought this Fire HD 7 on Prime day for $79 so my wife and I could have something that is easier to travel with than a full laptop.  This Fire works great for browsing the web, watching Youtube and Hulu, and playing some games.  The sound quality on this thing is quite impressive and we use it to play Pandora all the time.  I also purchased a bluetooth keyboard/case combo that is awesome.  My biggest complaint about this product is that it tends to freeze up every so often.  This seems to happen most often if you leave an app open and then lock the screen.  Other times the screen will just freeze while trying to load something and you have to either lock the screen and unlock it, completely shut it down and restart, or wait several minutes for it to figure itself out (doesn't always work).<br /><br />For the price I don't think you can beat it, but as I stated it isn't perfect.  Would I have paid full price for this item? No."
This Kindle is the worst I've had and we own 3 others. It often gets stuck on a page or kicks you off and back to the home screen.
I am enjoying it I just wish there was a manual for it.
I bought this and within two weeks my screen went black while my daughter was playing her app on her child account. It wouldn't charge or turn back on. I called and they sent me a refurbished one....so now I have a used kindle that I paid full price for....I feel like I got a yard sale device for the full price of a new one. I just hope this one works I guess.
It's not really set to be a book read. I don't really need the rest of what it does.I got the<br /><br />Fire to download woodworking magazines.
"Don't bother buying for a child or a teen. Parental controls are horrible. The product itself is fine, but child profiles and interface around them sucks. THERE IS NO WAY TO ENABLE WEB BROWSING FOR A CHILD! What? That was 80% of the reason for buying the product. My IT professional husband spent 1.5 hours trying to find and install a browser that would work under child (or teen) account. Nope, no go. So either you get your kid an independent amazon account pretending he/she is an adult, or let them use yours. Sure, no awkwardness there. My 12-year old would be able to see all my kindle purchases and my amazon order history. No thank you.<br /><br />Amazon - please get it together. Kids will browse the web. Concentrate on site blocking, not on a blanket prohibition of having a web browser under child's account. And by the way there is an option to unblock &#34;web browsing&#34;, but it actually doesn't do anything and will not put Silk (or any other browser) on your child's available application list. Shame on you!"
"First off, the battery drains very fast.  My IpadMini, which is almost three years old, has more battery life now vs. my new Fire.  Second, the screen sticks and wont allow certain actions if the Fire becomes moody.  Then I need to turn I off and hope that I can access the browser or email.  Finally, the reason I bought the dang thing is to read books; however the device won't have the screen stabilize.  I may go back to my second edition Kindle and just use that for books.  Amazon's product is inferior to the Ipad, plus most other devices.  I wonder if they were made by different companies than the first few Kindles.  I would not buy again or waste my money - even if it was on sale like mine."
Excellent tablet.
My kids love it! Great price! Wished that I would have bought the 16GB.
Love it but wish the battery would last longer.
"Bought this for my husband as a replacement for his old Fire.  Very nice picture quality and decent speaker, though it does sound better with headphones.  Runs very fast and was very easy to set up.  Downloads apps/games/movies, etc very quickly.  No complaints other than the battery seems to drain a little quicker than the last one."
The graphics are amazing
It's a great tablet what can I say. I still love my older Kindle but this one is much faster and better would definitely recommend it got a great price on it on prime day.
Like it so far. Moves faster than my old Kindle. Have not yet tried all the features. Will rate again later.
"As of now (I have it three weeks), I have no complaints. In fact, I'm loving it. I've been reading a lot and playing Scrabble and except for one point, it's what I wanted the Kindle for.  I need to download PDF files, which I can do, but I need to bold words for my teaching; however, the bold I typed in my computer do not show in bold lettering. I have been too busy to address this, but now I have some free time and will deal with it with product support. I sure hope I can solve this because it's one of the reasons I bought the Kindle. For reading and playing scrabble, it's wonderful. Good battery life."
It was the best device I've ever handled
Not at all happy had mine for a year since new it cuts out with no warning (plenty charge in battery)now it's started freezing when I touch screen to open an app and then has to be shut down and restarted to use but that does not always solve the problem I know I bought it for the books but I should be able to get more and you cannot get help to solve problems
"The Fire HD 7 is great. Definitely worth the money. I am not a technical reviewer, but for casual browsing and as a reader this a great device. I am very pleased with this purchase and the product support at Amazon."
Pros<br />- FireOS is simple and intuitive<br />- Prime integration<br />- excellent value ($79 on prime day)<br />Cons:<br />- Build quality feels a little plasticy<br />- Speakers ok (what do you expect on a 7&#34; tab)<br />- large bezel
very happy with it.
"Very impressed by the screen quality for video but I prefer my paperwhite Kindle for reading. The sound is good, not the greatest but more than acceptable. The power button seems a little flaky."
Love it!
I love this device. It is light enough for me to read for hours without my hand starting to hurt. Very easy to browse Kindle store. Battery life for me has been about 8 hours with constant reading and some game playing. Charges back to 100% pretty quickly.
enjoying this kindle fire even more than my first!
Love the device. Got it for my 7 year old.  Does everything I need it to and more.  I'm giving 4 stars because of the limited android games available.
Love my new Fire HD 7!  It's a perfect size and does almost everything my much bigger and more expensive iPad does.  So happy I made this purchase!
Great tablet!
"Traded up on Prime Day so the price was a steal.  Have had no trouble with my older one, even though many complained about them.  It is not an iPad by any stretch, but I find it to be a good fit with my families' needs."
Like the upgraded features over my old fire.  Works great.  Would prefer not to get ads posted when I turn it off and back on.
I don't like it was much as I did my iPad that got broken but it will due I'm glad I got it on sale!
This kindled is the greater
"Ok was not happy with 8GB storage but found that with the Amazon USB cable for 4th Gen FireHDs I could play music and videos from flash drives.  Movies work best if in MP4 format.  I also tried the SANDISK Wireless Drive and APP - it works great, and makes available to whatever you have stored on it to Android, IOS and Windows devices - at the same time via WiFi - advertises up to 4 hrs, but I can't confirm that yet but I have tested connectivity to multiple devices with simultaneous playback of different movies.  In the end I am very happy with the Fire with my add on storage."
so far I am enjoying it. No issues with the speed or screen.
"My husband is incredibly happy with his new Fire HD7!! He hadn't read in several years, and when he turned his Kindle on, it was dead. I called to get assistance, but even the staff at Amazon couldn't resurrect his old Kindle, so they offered him this one with a discount. Thanks Amazon...my husband now reads most of the day again, and just loves his new Fire!!"
"Awesome Fire, I absolutely love it!"
Much faster than my old Kindle but it has no space because the system uses so much. I bought the 8 gb without understanding how small that is. Of course that is my error for not checking into it but was a limited time offer about to expire.<br /><br />My Fire HD 7 often tells me I have a slow connection so I should download the movie to watch without interruption but there is not room for one movie on the device.
This is my third Kindle.  My second one just stopped working about 2 weeks ago. So I had to buy another.  Works great!!
do not find the use of this device intuitive at all.
"I got this for my Wife for her birthday present to replace an earlier version. I like the enhancements, specifically the addition of a camera app."
Love it!
I am in love! Didn't think I could like not reading a physical book but this is working out great for me plus being able to play games & surf online it works great for what I needed and the price.
"Portable, good value and easy to use tablet. Love it."
"Pretty good.  Not as nice as my old kindle for reading, but the other stuff helps make up for it!"
"I don't like getting advertising every time I turn my Kindle on.  Once again if I had the know how to delete this feature I would. Item has camera--I did not need this feature and was not told by CSA it was included. (Wouldn't that have made my purchase less?)  I don't like your providing me with your own search engine--if I had the know how to delete/change I would, but I don't.  Also the CSA said it was just like my present Kindle, but had more memory.  Its not like my current Kindle--since it has a camera, I now have to buy a new case for it.  The power cord is too short--doesn't allow simultaneous charging and using unless you're sitting right on top of an electrical outlet. Necessitates using an extension cord.  Also, please fix the power cord/charger inlet port.  All the Kindles I have bought have gotten too loose for the contacts to touch and allow charging of my Kindle.  I hate the feeling that this could be an easy fix, but Amazon just wants me to buy a new Kindle each time it happens.  Teach people to fix your product vs requiring it be replaced. Also, I accidently tripped the Prime enrollment when I purchased this item.  After 2 phone calls, and now a query on my credit card bill I'm still waiting for this to be retracted and money put back on my card.  If this rating gets any Feedback to the customer from Amazon, could you please tell me how to fix the above issues?  You have my data in my customer profile."
I would be lost without this kindle.  The camera has a wonderful quality.  The size of the screen is perfect for reading.  I read tons of books on my kindle and use the web to pull up recipes while I'm cooking in the kitchen.  There are tons of apps available and this kindle is so easy to use.  The screen is bright enough to read while I'm on the beach.  The battery life is nice and long so I am able to bring my kindle anywhere to read at great lengths.  I use my kindle when I teach yoga as well.  Some of the yoga books I use have kindle versions.  I have all of music on my cloud player and create playlists that are easily accessible.
Love love love
I love the size and the ease of use.  The high quality resolution can't be beat!!
still getting to know what all it does.  But do enjoy what I see so far.
"I will never buy another amazon tablet device again. These turds have not only disabled our choices in terms of modifying the way that we want to see our interface, they have blocked us from using interactive devices that would, in every other circumstance (using alternative hardware), provide valuable services. In short, DO NOT BUY and amazon device unless you crave to be tyrannically stripped of your choices regarding software."
"Glad I went with the 16 GB because unlimited cloud is misleading. Only free cloud for 90 days. Had an original Kindle, still works fine and is thinner but no back light. Fire does so much more there really isn't any comparison except Fire being thicker which can sometimes be an issue when you are reading in bed. Not big on music so sound I can't rate but everything else is perfect. Haven't traveled much with it yet because I did not get accessories since I wanted to get familiar with it first but have recently ordered case and earphone accessories which could make this purchase an even more highly rated one."
For the most part it meets expectations... Does tend to &#34;freeze up&#34; and needs to be rebooted.
"This is my first of the family Fire HD 7. Is smaller than I expected but it does work very well. I have included two pictures to see. The pictures and videos are sharp. Does not weight a lot making it easy to travel with. Is easy to manage with the basics of turning it on/off, volume on the side like a cell phone and the settings once you scroll down from the top screen. The sides does have a rubber grip to easily hold it but I do recommend to get a protector just in case it falls. I use this for simple emails online, video search and watching movies. What I can not do like my android is download youtube, pandora apps like my cell but you can download it from Amazon. Those apps are free unless you want to do other specific work on your youtube channel the high tech ones will probably need to be paid for. Overall, this product is worth it. Is simple and useful when you do not have your computer or laptop near."
Wish I could customize home screen and such but a solid purchase for sure
Excellent product
Perfect reader and handy tablet.
"Still getting the hang of the whole tablet, but so far so good! It's pretty intuitive, but there are a few areas I definitely need to learn more about how to use it, like customization."
"Nice display, fast processing,<br />Dislike- can't get lot of apps I enjoy on ipod"
This is my first Kindle and so far I really like it.
it's ok.. nothing special
Great product!! Kept kids entertained across the country!!  Loved the free game choices.  Educational to boot!!!
Love the white color and the camera!
"I find it quite irritating when I am doing an application and it takes me to another page unrequested, but by and large I really like most everything about it."
I love it. I have a kindle touch also. Love the fire so much more. Easy to use and do things on.
"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. i was not too sure about this but it has quickly taken the place of my computer. ITS PORTABLE YET HAS A BIG ENOUGH SCREEN FOR VIEWING, A GREAT SELECTION OF GAMES AND APPS. IVE NOT TRIED OUT EVERY FEATURE YET BUT LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT MY FIRE."
I absolutely love my new Kindle Fire.
I love it :)
"Not as good as I expected, as I thought I would be upgrading from the original kindle fire. However this kindle fire has issues with the web browser slowing down when using certain sites that have a lot going on. There is also an issue when on the internet browser and the kindle falls into sleep mode when u turn it back on it only shows a blank screen until you turn it off and then restart it."
"Coming from a full-up android 5.1 phablet, the Amazon version of Android can be a shock. Nothing is where you expect it to be. Nothing works like you expect it to. The UI feels like a too-tight sweater. Performance was awful. I was beginning to wonder if I had wasted my money.<br /><br />Then, my wife reminded me why I bought it: I wanted a bigger screen to read books and newspapers on. So I forced myself to use it for just that purpose.<br /><br />Got to say that when viewed from this perspective, it's a decent gadget. The UI makes sense (sort of) if all you're doing is reading a from a few sources all the time. I can see where Aunt Grace from Peoria would get the hang of it pretty quickly- and that's Amazon's true audience with this product.<br /><br />After seeing what it can't do, I'm wondering is one of the PaperWhite devices might have been a better deal as a pure reader- better display, better battery. Something I'd consider if I was buying again.<br /><br />Since I guess I'm stuck with my choice now, the big things I'd complain about are the glossy screen in bright light (hoping I can find a matte screen protector to remedy this), battery life (about a half-day of solid reading), and overall performance (forget about listening to Amazon music while reading).<br /><br />Summary: As long as you keep telling yourself it's a reader and not a full-up tablet, you'll be OK. If you're looking for a reader for Mom, Grandma, or Aunt Gracie, this might work. If you're looking for a full-up tablet, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a pure reader, I'm wondering is one of the PaperWhite devices might be a better deal."
"We have Sling on our Amazon Fire television.  We thought that since the Fire tablets were promoted as working with the Fire t.v., that we could watch Sling on this tablet; however, that is not the case.  We are unhappy that we cannot watch Sling on this.  We think that as long as Amazon is promoting these tablets as working with the Fire T.V., then all the things that can be done on the Fire T.V. should work on the tablet.  Otherwise, we like reading Kindle books, watching Amazon Instant videos, reading the Washington Post, playing games, and doing things on the internet on this tablet.  We were just unhappy about the Sling."
Just started using it and it works great.
great tablet - especially when on the move
Love this product! Lightweight but with a wonderfully clear picture. For the price it cannot be beat. Battery charges quickly and lasts a full day or more!
"Bought for gf, she's loving it"
"This kindle is so much lighter and easier to maneuver than my first edition kindle! Beautiful 7&#34; HD display with over a million pixels (216 ppi / 1280 x 800) I love the bright colors on the HD screen, it's so much nicer for the kids to watch movies!"
"I won the Kindle as part of our summer reading program. I love it! I ordered a case for it. Previously I had to read my Kindle books on my phone, but this is much better."
So far so good. A bit of relearning still going on. Big enough light weight and battery power good.
Great item.
I was so glad to get back my kindle and after using a &#34;tablet&#34; that kept losing WI-FI connections even at home. It was good to have a kindle which I could depend on.
great product
"The charging port on my last fire (and the other two before it!) ended up loosening up so much so that they wouldn't take a charge any longer. My mother-in-law uses her kindle daily, so I had to replace it with a new one which will probably last a little bit longer than the warranty covers, if history is any indication."
"Overall, I'm happy with it.  The resolution is excellent and it has a quick response.  My only issue is that the battery drains quickly.  I'm finding that even while I'm not using it, the charge goes down. I'm trying to find out how to close running apps, but can't find a clear answer on this model.  Other than the battery life issue, I really like it."
"Buggy, unreliable, subpar compared to my previous Fire HD 7&#34;, so disappointing. Two lengthy customer service phone calls since I got it in May! The old one was a gift in December 2012. I had used and loved the Kindle app on my iPod Touch for 3 years and was debating a Kindle Fire vs an iPad when a friend made the decision for me. I'm mostly a reader, with a few games and some Internet surfing, maybe a few old TV shows; I used it a lot and bought a LOT of book content because it was much easier to read on the Kindle than the Touch or my iPhone. Until 2.25 years in, this past spring, when the screen started flickering and then breaking up totally. I could not find a solution online and decided to buy a new Fire when it was on sale around Mother's Day. First problem: my books were not all showing in the Cloud. That was lengthy call #1 and included the CS rep saying that I would have to upload each book individually because some had updates (!). Today was lengthy call #2 because the Home icon opened to what looked like the App tab (but wasn't, because it included some books that hadn't been opened in months). That required a factory reset and again, hey, not all of my book content was showing in the Cloud! The CS pushed them out remotely. Not what's supposed to happen! I expect that this one will fail around the 2-year mark, too, and then I will be done with the Fire."
This was an addition.  We already had a Fire 7&#34; HDX and decided a second Fire would be useful.  As a second unit we did not feel the added expense of an HDX was necessary and it wasn't.  The HD meets our needs entirely.
I expected some form of Word and am disappointed that there's not! I do like the color and resolution.
I'm so glad to get my Kindle back. Never new how bad it would be without one after two years of having the other one before it went bad. The new one is more than I expected and I'm enjoying reading again and looking for new books. Amazon always comes thru and your support staff exceed all expectations.
I love it  !!!  I hope it will last longer then my  first one !! I had it for two years and it couldn't be fixed.
"I charged my tablet to 100% the night before. I go to work the next day and once I get home to use it, the battery level is already diminished to 10%. I even tried placing the tab on Airplane Mode in the hopes of keeping its battery life longer but battery was still drained.<br /><br />My iPhone 4 (5 years old) can retain its charge for about a week on standby."
Very pleased with it. I am 86 and my daughter is teaching me how to use it. I am a coin collector and the<br /><br />book has a lot of GOOD information.
Not all I thought it would be
Really just wanted a vessle to run plex in my bedroom. Bought it on prime day so it was a bargain.very happy with it.
"I was originally going to give this device 3 stars. It's an extraordinarily fast device for the price with a brilliant screen. I understood the limitations with the Amazon Marketplace and bought it anyway. However, Fire OS leaves a lot to be desired. This device will not screen cast to my Fire TV. I see no reason for this limitation. In fact, it will not allow Chromecast at all.So, I was going to give this a 3 star review. But if you install Fire OS 5.0, all that changes. You now have a nearly basic Lollipop experience. Did Amazon give up on the Fire OS Carousel? I don't know. All I know is I can have wallpapers and widgets again. You can even install launchers and any google apps. I can now use Chromecast with Netflix. I still can't cast Amazon Prime Instant Videos. I can even install side load play store apps.<br /><br />There is only one con and that is the keyboard. It is very slow to respond. Takes a few seconds to load. Then even when it is displayed, it is isn't done loading so I often type 3 letters that never show up. I finish typing and wait a few more seconds for the letters to catch up to my typing. But since I am missing the first 3, I have to start over again. If you use this as media device, this is not an issue. But if you do light forum discussions as I do, then it is too distracting for my tablet browsing experience. I have confirmed this behavior on 3 other Fird HD 7's owned by my family so it isn't limited to my device. I noticed the issue with all Fire OS 4.x thus far. It's subdued in Fire OS 5.0 but still there."
I love it!  It is easy to navigate and the HD makes it easier to read my books and play games.
"I loved my old Kindle, this one just is not even close to the same, not near as comfortable to hold and does not feel as well made. Worse news is, I purchased a Kindle reader for my husband and it is awful - can barely see the screen it is so dark and no way to adjust it."
"This is my second.  The first one was &#34;adopted&#34; by the grandkids, and I wanted a replacement.  This is great!"
"This is a revised review. At first I was disappointed but after a few months I'm pretty satisfied. Yes,  there aren't as many apps as Google play, but I managed to eventually get Roboform on it which is so much better than Amazon First Pass. The silk browser is smooth and fast. And Dialpad let's you use it as a phone with Wi-Fi. Facebook is not the same as the regular site but then it's not the same on a smartphone either. I got it as a Deal of the Day for $77 and it's definitely worth every penny. I gave it four stars only because of the limited apps but its got everything you need."
"I've had this for only  2 weeks and it quit working.  The battery is fully charged but the unit will not turn on.  I loved it during the two weeks that it worked - now, not so much."
"This is my 2nd Kindle.  So glad I brought a new one.  It was cheaper, bigger and better definition.  Very easy to tap into my cloud!!!!"
Was pleased with the brightness of the HD display.  All around head and shoulders above my old one.
"Great device for books, tv shows & movies. Can be frustrating when you're watching something and time it times out  (but that could be my WiFi). Great product for the pric"
"So far I am happy with this product.  My grandkids may have to teach me how to use it better, but it will work well for the reasons I purchased it.  Mainly to read books, watch how to videos while I work on projects and play games when my lap top is not available."
"Wow, this was a lot nicer than I expected. And at almost half off....well I wished I had bought a couple more."
Great tablet for the money!
"Overall, I got this kindle on sale for $60 off during Prime day. It was the only thing I wanted on prime day. It is still all the limitations of an amazon tablet vs a regular tablet -- including the REALLY annoying aspect of going through the internet to use youtube when obviously an app would be a lot easier and less temper-tantrum-throwing on amazon's part. It also feels a bit cheap--plastic-y and a bit of bulk and girth for being so hollow seeming inside. It has some bugs--it tends to freeze up quickly, and it tends to get really confused during high-demand apps like netflix and I've had to power it down and restart it a couple times already because of this issue. I have to completely get out of the program before turning the screen off to fix this.<br /><br />But for $100, it has a lot of memory and space, it saved the day when I needed something else with internet access when the wireless card on my laptop went out, and I use amazon frequently since I have prime so I have access to the shows, and the music, and all of that jazz. I also like having it small enough to shove in my purse or bag to take with me. I do want a bigger tablet eventually, but this is perfect for pulling up a recipe I need to cook with from online, or plugging into the stereo to play music while I do things around the house. It's a great little tablet, if you can get over the amazon-only limitations. A lot of people can't, which is understandable.... but hey, I have a smart phone, and a laptop, and between those two things I can deal with it. Also it DOES support netflix, which is the other really big thing I use it for.<br /><br />Having prime? I think for $100 this tablet is worth it. I would NOT have paid $159 for this tablet, but I thought the $100 price tag was fair."
I have had several Kindle Fires.  I dont like this one as much as the earlier ones.  I dont want one with games and other foolishness I want to read and you make it difficult for me to do so.  I may have to stop buying from you and try other types.
I ordered a 16 gb fire and had it for a week and loved it. It's a little different because it's hard to use anything that amazon doesn't promote but worth a little work i was able to use them.  When i liked at the box i realized they sent me an 8gb. So now I'm trying to get what i originally ordered.  I've never had so much problems with an order from amazon
Love it
"Please tell me what it cost.<br />thanks,  Mary Garland"
Love the HD 7
"Meh. I'd classify this as an e-reader, not a tablet.  If a tablet, I'd give it 1 1/2 - 2 stars.<br /><br />This reader's settings are useless combating glare. I had a better experience after applying Boxwave clear touch anti-glare screen and then setting brightness to max. I only purchased this model instead of the Paperwhite because I was told by the salesperson at BestBuy that I'd only be able to use the Overdrive app (my preferred reader for borrowed library books) on this model.  Hope he wasn't mistaken :/<br /><br />It's fine for e- and audio books and games that aren't graphics intensive such as Dots, Mahjong, Spider Solitaire,  Chicktionary. But graduating up even a half step to PandaPop is a disappointing experience coming off one's smartphone (Samsung Note 3 in my case).<br /><br />The big plus is the pricetag. At $140, I have *no* qualms using it at the beach/pool, lol. ;-)"
"So far excellent tablet for reading, watching programs and ease of use.  It's size contributes to its versatility.  It is a good go to tablet to use instead of larger tablets and/or laptops.  Love it."
just what we needed at a good price
"Awesome! Delivered on time, box could bang all over inside though so adding air packs or something to keep it packed tight and padded would be a lot nicer. It made me worry if it could have been damaged in shipping. It works fine though so far :) Takes beautiful crisp pictures, little heavy for me to hold and a bit large for my hands compared to the smaller original Kindle Fire, but that's just because I have finger joint issues and small hands. Speakers sound very nice, clear without any distortion and the double speakers really made watching movies or listening to music a much more enjoyable experience. I'm going to save up and buy my mother one for Christmas, she's 60 and technically challenged but I believe Kindles are much easier to use than most tablets I have tried (as far as a easy to learn use of a tablet). I bought mine through the FingerHut credit rebuilding store/website. Amazon handled the purchase/shipping of it though. I felt much safer/confident knowing Amazon was the one the Kindle was coming from."
Great deal!
"Slow.  Hangs up.  Does not respond to commands.  Cannot adjust audio tone or vol for keyboard taps.  Hi res display, good color.  Ample audio vol for music, movies."
I have a fist edition Kindle Fire.. I was tire of not being able to see the screen at the beach and it would not hold a charge very long anymore.. Time for an upgrade! My new Kindle is much better for the beach. Battery last all day and screen is a little bigger.. So for really worth the Christmas in July price of 79$!!!
"Love my kindle!  Lightweight, super fast and so easy to enjoy a multitude of options; reading, browsing, videos, music<br />My only wish is that my white kindle came with a white charger_ :("
Love my new Fire. It's easy to learn and fun to use.
We really are enjoying the tablet
"I really like the fire, the only issue I have is the battery discharges way faster then my original kindle fire, even when I've taken all of the battery conservation techniques.  Also.. I really don't like that there isn't an indicator light that tells me when it's charging and when it's finished."
Fit and function is great
So far so good..
Love the Kindle! Nice quality screen resolution and fast processor. Amazon makes good quality  tablets.
I love it. I read and watch movies. Very clear picture.
Not as user friendly as I would like.
"Clean graphics, easy to read, even without my glasses."
very good.
Best thing I've bought in a long time!!
I wanted a tablet for reading my books and would be easy to carry around.  I was really surprised when I got my tablet.  The screen is sharp; easy to hold while reading.  I have a lot of electric &#34;toys&#34; and I would definitely recommend this tablet.
My son absolutely lives it.
I like it. It is thicker so it seems more durable. Lots of games. Easy to use.
"Love the graphics and reading backlight,"
I like the new fire hd 7 except for one thing. You have to turn it on to find out if it is charged. My first one had a light on the pad to let me knoe when it was fully charged.
Do not like the touch screen.
Just Okay.
Camera better
Very nice
I-pad much better and easier to use
"I looked this over for six months and got on sale.  I am so glad I did.  I had the first Kindle Fire that came out for five years.  I am so impressed with the wifi reception and internet browser on this.  I like the features.  Easy to see, but there is a magnifier for menu text and browser if you need it.  Battery does not last as long as the original Kindle Fire, but lasts about four hours.  I still love this as a backup because it is reliable to access most anything off the internet as a backup to computer.  Highly recommend."
"I am completely happy with this new Fire.  I bought the first generation and didn't like it.  I love this one (4th Gen.)  I am on a Homeowner Association Board Of Directors and use it for all of my meeting.  We have Wi-Fi at the club house and I am able to store my documents on it and can call them up when I need them.  I only have to take a thin note book with me to meetings.  My wife has a expensive i-pad mini and I can do everything on my Fire that she can.<br /><br />I have amazon prime so I can stream free movies and free music,<br /><br />I only paid $89 for it (Regular $139) because of Amazon Prime Day a couple of weeks ago, but I think its a good deal at $139."
Awesome deal!!  Love it!
"I like it.  It is light, bright and wonderful."
Awesome
"Love the fire. This is our second one. It is used by Mom for email and web access. It is easy for her to operate, charge and carry around. Graphics are good."
Love it. Has rear and front camera.
The product looks nice but tends to turn off or drop out when watching movies or playing on-line games.  This is annoying to say the least.
Just what I expected.
"I bought two of the 7&#34; models, plus one 8.9&#34; model, in December 2013 as Christmas gifts for family members.  This past year, all three stopped working and wouldn't turn on.  One conked out a few months ago and the other two did so recently.  I had the feeling something was inherently wrong with the Kindles shortly after my family started using them, one of them started freezing, then another one started doing the same shortly after that.  I know technology is fickle, but I would expect them to last longer than a year and a half since I paid Amazon nearly $600.00 total including covers for each.  On top of this, I bought my Samsung 10.1 tablet in November of 2012 (from BJ's Wholesale Club, of all places) and it's still working perfectly.  I could understand if one of the three Kindles I bought malfunctioned, but all three?  I will not be purchasing any more of them."
love this fire . its a perfect size...
I love it! I got this to replace my old first generation Kindle Fire and it's a big improvement. I don't really have anything negative to say about it. It does everything I need it to do and it does it well. I probably should have bought one sooner. It's a neat little gadget. I combined it with a Roocase that comes with the stylus and the combination is very nice.
"This was a replacement for my son's Fire HDX that shattered and quit working the first time it was dropped (unfortunately we didn't get the replacement plan). I'm surprised at how user friendly it ISN'T.  I opted to save a few bucks and have the ads come preprogrammed,  and intended to use a photo or some other graphic as a Screensaver. I have yet to figure out how to save a photo as a Screensaver or even background for this Kindle.  The quality is there,  as well as speed and so far storage is great.  Navigating is the only thing that I don't like about it.  Of course it's not my Kindle,  and my son seems to have no problems or qualms with it.  I just don't remember his other Kindle being this ornery."
"So I'll keep this short and sweet. I decided to pick one of these up on Prime Day. I really had never thought much about getting a Fire tab but It was on sale for something like 80 dollars so I said, &#34;why not?&#34; I have no issues at all with the functionality of this tab. Looks great, pretty light, good display and has great specs for the price. Here is my issue. It is the same reason I prefer Android over IOS or PC over Mac or a Chromebook. I hate not having options. Because this is an Amazon product everything goes through Amazon. It's like everything on a chromebook is ran through Google services; without other options. I have to use the browser on it which is called Silk which I wouldn't mind but I can't import any bookmarks or anything from my phone or PC. You have to use the Amazon app store. It doesn't have a lot of things that the google store has but you can't get the Google play store. No issues with Amazon or this tablet I just didn't do my research. The point is if you want or need to be able to access your accounts from google or Microsoft (you can check email), documents whatever on your PC, any non-fire phone, Mac, chromebook whatever this isn't for you. If you want this for basic stuff: Games, kids, web browsing, reading it is perfect and if that's what you're looking for I'm sure you would love this but for me it just doesn't cut it."
having to side load ap's is pain but the deviice is very solid.
"Nice tablet,  screen is excellent, Many apps already installed. I may need to delete some of the ones I don't use."
Awesome. Has a lot of great features and is a nice size. I like the size compared to the HD 6. There is so much that I cannot explain it all. I recommend all who are interested see what the e of Kindle Fire they want and do research. It has a lot of memory. It processes very quick.
Well pleased with Fire HD.  Easy to operate.
"love the kindle fire, my only complaint is the charger cord is too short."
It does what I need it to so I am pleased with my decision to buy it.
It is a great tablet to read on.  I only wish it had access to Google play.
"I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it as well as I. I then ordered one for myself but it got put on backorder for a month or so. But I finally got it after 4-6 weeks. Anyways, I absolutely LOVE it!!"
I've enjoyed reading books and watching Amazon Prime on my new Kindle! Would highly recommend it.
Love it.
"I'm a little disappointed in my new Kindle. It's a good reader and as Kindle does, it is, in my opinion, better than my iPad for viewing movies. My complaints are that the camera isn't worth having; not HD. Grainy, grainy images. And the battery runs down very, very fast. Finally, turning down the sound while watching video requires three steps/screens."
Never used a tablet before and this one is easy to understand and use. Also the customer support folks really helped this tech dummy get started. LOVE IT.
Great deal on fire hd. Arrived on time
Like it as much as my other larger Kindle Fire. Those difference in size is barely noticeable.
Excellent!
"The screen is just beautiful, case is more challenging to use.  Not impressed.  I wish there was someone to talk to with some probems that I have.<br />It would have made the whole experience easy and so much better and maybe five stars would show up.  Right now its still a hit and miss.  So I won't get the whole positive experience and that's a shame."
This was my favorite Kindle of all time and it finally died.  I am not happy with the replacement of a Paperwhite.
I love my kindle fire!!!!
Love it!
Love it
Very pleased with my new kindle! Love the camera feature that I can now shoot a photo without trying to get a shot while viewing it from the front only plus I can now shoot video!
LOVE MY kINDLE.  ON SLEEPLESS NIGHTS I CAN READ AND DISTURB NO ONE BY PUTTING ON LIGHTS.
"My second Fire, the HD is awesome.  My old Fire was still nice enough to hand down"
Nice tablet.
This is working great for the kids to watch their shows on Prime. It came already set up with our account info. We added the wifi and the kids were set.
"I bought this during the prime day sell for $89 and ended up returning it to amazon for a refund. This tablet has a nice screen with the high pixel density and preformed tasks fast, however it has advertisements built into it. The speakers are truly amazing and the best I have ever listened to on a tablet. It is kinda thick but feels good in the hand. I got the white version and that was a big mistake because it got dirty very fast like within the first day of having it. I really liked this tablet but I ended up returning it because I did not use it frequently and also decided to put the $89 towards paying my credit card bill from buying an apple watch. This tablet also does not have google play store built in and it runs on android. I would have kept this tablet for watching movies, playing clash of clans, and probably for reading E books but I didn't have the money. I also own a Microsoft surface 2 which I already use for watching Netflix and it has a bigger screen than this one. The kindle was overall pretty cool just don't buy the white version, and be warned that advertisements will appear on the locked screen. If you have the money for it and can justify it go ahead and buy one, also you can return it if you use prime within 30 days. I hope my review helps.  :)"
Love it
"a lot of people talk trash about fire OS but so far i had no problems and i really like it. This tablet is very cute and i even like it more than my laptop. It has very strong speakers btw. It feels great to listen to music or watch movies with these speakers. Reading books have never been so good. I was first skeptical about it but all my worries have gone now. I bought this tablet because our bookshelves at home have no place left for books and our home has no place left for extra bookshelves! Like i said previously, reading books have never been so good. First of all the screen brightness is perfect and it doesn't mess with my eyes. Its actually even better because with a real book you wood need a light all the time and i like reading in darkness more. Second, the translation and highlighting options are perfect. Turning the pages are easier. Also now you don't need to worry about brushing pages of a thousand books every once in a while to protect them. And i don't know if this happens to others but old books make me itch.<br /><br />I love this thank you amazon."
It is exactly what I wanted.
"This is not at all what we expected. It freezes frequently, is very slow, and we are returning it."
Amazing
Great tablet. Using it all the time. Nice.
I take it everywhere. I quit reading for awhile cause I was having a hard time reading small print. This has gotten me back to reading again an I love it.
Fell in love with it. It is everything I hoped it would be.
"Very nice.  Now, if I can just figure out how to use it."
Love my new kindle fire
Enjoying it much. Wish it were able to operate without wifi
Love my new Fire HD 7 and so happy I was able to buy for $79 on Prime Day!
I have used a tablet with kindle app for 4 years. It is getting slow and won't hold a charge so this was a great deal and replacement.
Love it
Fun
"I reviewed this before Alexa was forced down our throats.  We have NO choice about this obnoxious memory hog, as Amazon assumes we've only rented this hardware from them.  We don't own it.  FU Amazon.  I bought this from Best Buy because my Kindle Keyboard finally gave up the ghost.  I HATE KINDLE FIRE.  HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT.  Hate it with the passionate fire of 1,000 burning suns, that's how much I hate it.  I wanted a device that would do lots of things for a reasonable price.  I also wanted the ability to READ BOOKS.  You know - books?  Things you READ?  And yes, it's possible with the Kindle Fire.  If you transfer them to your device INDIVIDUALLY.  No bulk transfer option possible - at all.  In any way.  NONE.  I have thousands of books.  INDIVIDUALLY.  Just imagine that.  Roll it around in your mind.  When I went on the forum to ask, sure that I was mistaken and I just couldn't figure out how to transfer my material, the overall response was &#34;Why would you want to&#34;?  Gee, I can just access the heavenly cloud anytime I want, read a book, then send it back to heaven!  Really?  Who controls the cloud?  I don't.  I want my books on my device and where I can get to them without the grace of the Cloud hovering over me.  And yes, it's possible.  One at a time.  Why the hell did I do this to myself?  Amazon, KMA.  Seriously.  I can't believe you've done this to your customers."
"I have always loved Amazon. I thought Amazon was ''the one''. I  decided to commit and became a prime member. Me and Amazon together forever.  So when Amazon decided to have a day dedicated to me- its prime member-I felt obliged to reciprocate by purchasing a Fire HD. My IPad Mini had recently left me a widow, so the timing was perfect. It was meant to be.  Finally, my new late night reading companion arrived.  Well, you can imagine my horror when I charged it up, turned it on, and some buxom babe advertising a game app popped up on my screen.  Amazon knew I would not want this constant reminder of my beloved's two-timing ways, and offered to discontinue this advertising affair for an extortion fee of $15. I felt so used. But what's a girl to do? Obviously, I was never special. No doubt there were signs (and small print) that I missed. But love can be blind. Yes, our relationship has continued. But now that I know where I stand, my eyes may wander...."
Very happy. I had a Kindle fire and up graded to this HD at a great price.
"Very nice, a bit odd sized: to big for easy palm hold, but nice to stash away."
"Got it at a super price so I am pleased with that.  Easy to use if you're familiar with Android, decent screen clarity and very good sound. Body feels a bit cheap but I always get a cover anyway. Camera is unimpressive. Great that you can download movies (if you are Prime member) and watch offline for free. The biggest downside is the inability to use Google Play for apps.  The Amazon library is missing some basics like Dropbox. That is a disappointment that isn't really noted in the description.<br />Since I got it for such a good price ($99) I think it's a good value. It will fill my need as a smaller backup tablet but there may be other Androids out there for good prices too. Know your options, the Google Play blockade really irritates me at times."
"the Fire is fast and generally a really good option in the price range. However there are some caveats: I wish there was more compatibility with popular apps. I use google docs for everything and there is no way for a non techie to use it easily.  I've notice that the silk browser is also not supported by certain web pages.  The screen is also extremely bright, reading at night it lights up the whole room."
"Very crisp HD display - even on some of my old movies (1940s) I watch on it.  The &#34;special offers&#34; (read: advertisements) aren't annoying like I thought they'd be, as they only appear at the unlock screen.  My only complaint is the placement of the volume control.  I really like that they are buttons on the outside edge rather than onscreen, but when I want to watch a movie with my M-Edge cover on it to prop it up,  I have to turn it upside down.  Then when I want to power off, I have to turn it right side up.  I minor problem, I know - deal with it, right?!  It also powers on and loads movies, etc., much faster than my old Gen 1 Kindle Fire.  I just hope the charging port holds up better than my first Kindle!"
Great value for the price.
"I've purchased 4 Kindles in the past 4 years.  The original was a Fire.  I loved it, but when I bought a Fire HD for a grandchild last Christmas, I was impressed with  how much they had changed.  I bought a new one for myself and one for my daughter's birthday this summer.  We are both very happy with the Fire HD, and we are exploring all the things it can do."
"Still getting used to it as it's my first Fire tablet.  Not off to a great start however.  After ordering it on Prime day it just arrived (a month later...).  Also, after doing some digging apparently &#34;Special Offers&#34; in the name of the tablet did not refer to the fact I bought it on Prime Day but that it's loaded with ads.  Every lock screen is an ad for some childish app or game.  Doesn't affect the functionality of the machine, but damn is it ridiculous.  The other part that is frustrating is that nowhere on the order page does it say that SPECIAL OFFERS means advertisement machine."
I have an older Kindle Fire and love it but I wanted one with a forward camera.  This one seems to have a bit of a delay but I will see what happens as I go along.
I'm doing my Masters program curriculum on my Kindle Fire and it is great.
Fit our need and got great price on prime day.  Good for kids and surfing the web and apps.  Battery life is only issue.  Great tablet for the money.
"I ordered my kindle about mid June but it was supposed to get shipped August 1st because they were out of stock at the time. Come August 1st, they still hadn't shipped it yet so I waited a few days before notifying Amazon. When I fianlly did, they notified me they were out of stock until the 10th of August. I was very excited to get my kindle, but I understood that they had a high demand for it. I love Amazon and the Amazon experience, so I wanted a Kindle Fire since I already had a Kindle Paperwhite. I wanted a tablet that was fully compatible with Amazon (such as Amazon instant video, audio books, etc.,) and also a tablet in which I can do the same things that I do on my android phone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out that Amazon is very limited in the apps available for download. There is also not much customization available. These two things were a big downfall for me to be honest. The camera also isn't that good, which I already knew prior to buying it but I didn't mind.  The special offers on the lock screen bother me and I have tried to remove them, but there is no option to. Another small issue is typing; it is very with the cursor when I need to retype something. Ultimately, the kindle Fire HD 7 runs pretty smooth, has a nice screen resolution, and the volume is surprisingly loud. It is a good price for a tablet, but if I would have known the apps and customization are limited, I would have preferred a Galaxy. The other issue is that I would like to be able to access all of my Amazon apps from it as well, so I feel like I can't really win either way."
"First you should know, I'm a diehard Apple user and I'm disappointed in the Kindle Fire.  The keyboard is cranky and a bit slow and certainly I have not found the OS intuitive at all.  I still can't figure out how to get into my music library.  However, really, I only paid $79 for this tablet and it takes good pictures for sure.  I discovered though that to make use of the email system I have to surrender privacy rights to Amazon and to Google and I found I was not comfortable doing so.  Really, more Big Brother?  I would not buy it again.  It makes a good &#34;Audible&#34; book reader, but I have that with my iPhone.  And that is basically sort of what it is, a clunky bigger Kindle reader (my Kindle is a paperwhite and doesn't have audible) and that's about all I can say.  I have a grandchild and maybe in a few years....."
now i have all my books at my fingertips without carrying a bigger device.
I love it!  I have no complaints whatsoever :)
Just got this Fire HD7.  First time using a tablet.  Getting used to it and so far no problems<br />trying to navigate it.  Went on line to Amazon Kindle help and learned what I needed to know.<br />Also the Kindle Help Forum is a great place to find help.
I really like the features on this kindle.
Much better than I was expecting!
Easy to set up.
So excited love reading however with the kindle hd I can do more.  Enjoy.
I like it but very hard to set up and figure out!!!!
"A good quality tablet at less than $100!  I also own an iPad mini, but I use the Fire tablet more often.  It offers great readings through the kindle unlimited and a huge library of great videos.  It lags sometimes, but it's manageable."
Poor product quality.
We got this on the Amazon black Friday sale for an amazing price. It will show up under the tree for our daughter in December.
very limited in the options to connect to devices.
Awesome
Great deal! Perfect for the kids
Really impressed with this product.
"I have had my Fire HD for about a month.  It is my first tablet, and I really got it with the hope that it would be able to replace my laptop, which is slowly dying.  It is great in some ways, like for simple things.  But I really can't see that it will replace a laptop.  There are certain things that I can't do on the Fire.  For instance, sending emails with attachments?  I can't figure out how to do it!  I also really hate not having a proper keyboard.  I was hoping that I would get used to it, but I haven't.<br /><br />All in all, I'll keep the Fire HD for things like reading books and watching TV, or when I just don't feel like lugging around my heavy laptop.  But otherwise, I'll stick with a real computer!"
So happy with the display and the heft of this tablet. Did get the leather protector for added safety.
Perfect! I'm semi-retired and spend a lot of time in Mexico.  Excellent for travel.  Super user-friendly.  Hardly ever leaves my side.  Couldn't be happier
Excellent.  Only draw back is the on and off switch.  Appears that this one is going to break as<br />my original Fire
Easy to use. I also love picture quality while watching movies.
Love my new HD 7&#34; Fire.I had a Fire (not HD)before this one but it died. This one is faster and easy to use. It is set up differently than the other but  user friendly. My other seemed when you had your finger close to the screen it would change frequently. This one doesn't seem as sensitive. Would recommend.
"I want to start by saying I really like my Fire HD 7.  I don't want anyone to read this review and think I'm not happy with my tablet.  Two of my three complaints are my fault for not paying closer attention to the product specs.  I'm very happy with it except for a few things.<br />  I am such a huge amazon fan that I almost feel guilty about pointing out, what I see as a few 'challenges' for the Fire HD 7.<br />There were a few things I was a little disappointed with on my new Fire HD 7.  The first two are really my fault for not paying closer attention to the product specs when I ordered it.<br />  First, there is no flash for the camera!  The first night I got it I wanted to check out the camera and I had to turn every light in the house on to even get the pictures to show up.  Forget about taking a picture with it outside anytime after dusk.<br />  Secondly, I didn't realize when I purchased it that you can't access the internet using your phone provider.  So when I'm on a road trip and my husband is driving I can only view or read what I have downloaded to the devise and can't access the internet.  This drives me crazy.<br />  The other thing that is really strange is that when you are reading books, and only when you're reading books, you can't place two fingers on the screen and expand the size of the text.  You can expand it by tapping the screen three times and it does expand the text,...once....so you have no control.  There's only one text expansion size on the Kindle Books.  And to make it even worse, when you do expand the text, it doesn't fit inside the screen!!!! And yes I've turned it horizontally and it still won't fit all the text inside the screen.<br />  I seems like the Fire HD 7's big brothers do have at least two of the features I feel are missing from this one.  It might be that my daughter will end up with my Fire HD 7 and I'll end up getting one of the larger (and more expensive) Fire Tablets.<br />  As I mentioned, my first two complaintsare listed in the product description and I guess I just missed them.  If the things I mentioned aren't a big deal for you, and especially if you are a big Amazon Fan then it's a great little tablet!"
It's great!
"The battery drains quickly, the &#34;recently viewed&#34; icon bar is annoying, and the Android apps aren't particularly impressive.  However, the picture quality is top-notch and this is the ideal tablet on which to watch videos from Netflix and Amazon Prime."
"I love my Kindle!  So, it isn't an iPad, but it certainly isn't the extremely expensive price as the iPad either! I am on my Kindle every day. I let me grandkids play on it and have some really cute games for them on it.  I thought I would use the  gigs in no time, but I have had it almost five months now and still have not used all 8 gigs."
Love my fire :)
working well
"Wonderful device.  Excellent screen resolution and excellent sound.  This is a good value for the price.  However, I didn't know the OS blocks access to all Google software.  As a result, all you can really do is buy more stuff from Amazon and access Amazon Prime music and video.  As a result, it's a paperweight.  Back in the box it goes."
Love this thing ... can't get enough of reading late at night :)
great tablet！
Good.  Wish it had a not reflecting screen.
Very complicated to use. Parental control and family profiles are a home. Not intuitive at all. Would return and get an iPad if I could
Great case
"Wow, this Fire HD 7 is a great little tablet.  The pictures and video are very clear and the sound is great for a small tablet!  It came with a few added extras which are really nice to have.  It is pretty speedy too!  I am glad that I have Amazon Prime which gives me lots of extras for this tablet; such as movies, music and free apps.  This is one of the best tablets I have bought.  I really enjoy my Amazon products; the Amazon Echo is also a great addition to have in your home.  I have this too and love it!"
It wasn't useful to me for the reason I wanted to use it for.
Very pleased with the Fire HD 7!!
Easy to use.  Great display.  Easy to print from.  Love it.
Wanted the two way camera.
Better than the old Fire!
It was everything that i was looking for - Fit perfect and love the color
"Great, my granddaughter loved it!"
"Great screen, and easy to use"
Very nice!
Love the &#34;camera&#34; feature. Takes video and pictures among all of the other wonderful things that a kindle fire can do. Love that it now comes in white too!
I love my Kindle Fire.
Bought this for my wife.  She loves everything about it!
"Really happy with this on two fronts.  Purchased on July 15th, and the clarity is wonderful.  Nothing beats being an Amazon Prime Member.  Nothing."
"I own the Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD from 2012 and could hardly wait for this from 2014.  This new Kindle is even better than the 2012. The improvements have already been mentioned but one of my favorites is the ability to touch the carousel and push it up to see all my downloaded apps. No searching for them. I also like the new arrangement of the sidebar Search, Home, Back Arrow. The new placement of where the charger plugs in is much more convenient. Depending on how you hold the tablet, the charger cord will either be on the right or the  top of the tablet. I definitely did not like having the charger at the bottom. It didn't sit up nicely when charging. Having used the 2012 version for 3 years, I give it a B+ rating.  This new 2014 I just purchased I give a resounding A+.  I can't find any fault with it."
Very happy with my Fire so far!
"Love my new kindle. Only problem I have is connecting to Wi-Fi at home, as I don't have a computer. Connects at work though!! I also thought is would have a lot more storage than my old Kindle but found I had to delete a lot of books to clear up some space. Other than that, I am thrilled beyond words to have a Kindle again and all the new functions that my old one didn't have!! It's great!"
"Am TOTALLY Loving my Kindle! Still on a learning curve with it - haven't checked it out completely yet, but, so far, I have NO complaints!"
Using my kindle for email is one of my favorite features. It is more convenient than using my computer.
"This is so easy to use, and the size is great to take traveling. Wonderful display and features."
I ordered the kindle fire HD 7 on Prime Day. It's the version with ads (which I don't find obtrusive but would consider paying the extra $15 to not deal with them in retrospect).<br />I bought this as a replacement for my first generation fire and it's a vast improvement in speed and screen responsiveness. I still hate the design of the home screen and wish there were more personalization options. The one thing I really miss from the original Fire is the construction. The color is the back plate and it feels like cheap and crackable plastic. I really liked the matte rubbery back of the original Fire. This will be the first tablet I buy a case for I dislike the construction that much.
"Overall great product. Cannot download histogram, which aggravated me....can do just about everything an iPad does-love reading books in bed without a lamp on!!"
Its awesome
"I love it: it's nice looking and the colors are great.  I bought it mostly for reading,  and it is truly easy on the eyes.<br /> 80s very light and easy to carry around.<br />Don't like that the back is plastic, though."
Just upgraded from the First Kindle (finally) and I love all the changes so far.  Great deal on a device I use for everything.
"It is a very good tablet, it is well made. Sadly it's down side is a lack of apps and it is not an ipad killer. Plus the adds on the lock screen are annoying, and Amazon charges you to remove it"
"It's completely useless, no way to connect anything to it.  Boy did I read something wrong.  Complete waste of money."
"I really love my Fire HD 7 Kindle.  I take it everywhere I go.  I can check my emails, go on the web and play my games.  I wouldn't know what to do without it!!!!!!"
Love it !!!
"During purchasing Amazon asks you if you want the  &#34;Special offers&#34; option or not, they don't tell you what the &#34;Special offers&#34;  is so you select it any way. The Special offers means your tablet Fire comes with background ads when you first turn on your Fire (or come out of sleep mode). They are the large, full screen ads, or screensavers (shown below). The other ads are the books, apps, music, videos, etc that appear below the carousel to display what &#34;Customers Also Bought.&#34; The only way to remove this is paying Amazon $15!  And if you choose to not select the &#34;Special offers&#34; at check out the tablet price rises $20...you cant win  Also, when you add a new app a &#34;suggested&#34; apps are shown below.  At the end of the day, I don't want to be pushed with more advertisements. I want to be able to all my Fire &#34;MINE&#34; and NOT &#34;Amazons&#34;.  Edit (September): The camera has very poor quality, all my images are grainy. I attached an image of en eagle I was less than 10 feet from and a recipe I tried to take off a bottle....not impressed  Edit March 2016: I wish I would have saved my money and purchased another device- Amazon is now removing encryption from their tablets. Encryption keeps us safe by preventing third parties from recovering data. Think about the passwords you keep or even important for sensitive data like social security numbers that might be stored on devices."
exactly as I expected..........love it.......takes great pictures
"This is great. Love the speed and clarity.  Quality of the video player is amazing.  This does not work with Google Play which to me is the only downfall, but is a major one."
Love it!
Love it!
I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it. Very user friendly.
"I got this to stream shows in my kitchen, works well for streaming and browsing.  The blue tooth does not work that well which is funny cause it was paired with my Echo 3 feet away. Find it ironic that two amazon devices have a hard time communicating. Work work well for the price point."
"My Kindle freezes up and I am constantly having to power it down and back up again.  When I clicked on the &#34;return&#34; button in hopes of exchanging it, it said I was too late (2 weeks too late).  This is my 4th Kindle - I used to love them, but this one is frustrating me to no end.  Perhaps it's time to become an Apple user after all - at least they stand behind their product.  Second Entry:  I emailed Amazon and they took care of me!  Shrew!  I would've been extremely disappointed in them if they had left me high-and-dry, but they didn't!  THANK YOU, AMAZON!!!!"
I love the HD 7.  My grand daughter also loves it!
"Is it just my device or does anyone else experience the worst battery life? It doesn't hold a charge. With the device on airplane mode, I watch one show/movie and the batter life cuts in half or more. Play a game and the same thing happens. I can't believe how bad the battery life is"
This is an awesome piece of technology~!
"I love my Kindle Fire HD! It is easy to operate, fast and the perfect size!"
I guess I expected the displays to be more vivid being the bit larger size.  Not as simple finding what you need as in my old one.  I guess I will have to get used to it but am sorry my old one died.
Love my Fire HD7 it's a little different than my old Kindle Fire.  I'm learning more about my fire as the days go by.
Love the kindle! Even has a parental control that way my son can only enter certain apps when he's on it
"It's everything I wanted and more!!! Love it so much. This Kindle is fast, holds all my pictures and books. It has different settings for my kids and myself. The kid profiles have parental controls and even control how much the kid is allowed to use it. I am so happy with the unlimited kindle option for ALL the educational books and apps. My kids LOVE IT!! Which makes me love it even more.<br />I am truly happy with this purchase. One of the best I have ever made. Everything I was looking for in a tablet I have with my kindle. It's durable, beautiful color. It matches the sellers description perfectly. I will highly recommend to everyone!"
"I have had two Kindles. Now with the Fire I can read, listen to music, take and share photos. I am excited to learn new things with it."
"I received my new Kindle on Monday and as of today, Friday still haven't been able to set up email on it. I WRONGLY assumed that it would much easier to do myself...I tried calling Kindle and they said to call my ISP.  My ISP said to call Kindle. I spent over half an hour with a Kindle CS Rep who thought I was asking him about my MAC the whole and not about my IMAP server!!  I am so frustrated!  I am about ready to send this back!  My tech server guy is out of town for another week so I will have to pay him $100 per hour to help me!!! .  NOT A HAPPY CAMPER RIGHT NOW!!!"
"There needs to be a waterproof case, otherwise good"
Great so far!!
Love it!
Love love love .  I got it for my daughter .  She loves it .  My son has the iPod .  And I feel like I wasted so much money on it .  I should've got the Kindle fire too
"I received my kindle fire a day early.  Needless to say, the shipping was unproblematic. The color appeared slightly different than in the images however,  that is to be expected.  The videos look slightly above average. The app store has some inefficient qualities (unavailability). The tablet frequently has &#34;glitches&#34; where I have to stop the application amd restart it (about 2 a day with 2 hours use). I feel as though I mainly purchased the ability to download videoa from prime. If that quality was universally applicable,  I would not purchase another kindle fire. It was about average and for the price, other tablets can surpase the qualities it has available. I've only owned this for 2 weeks so I will update after thoroughly exploring it. Update: the product continues to freeze. It appears to be occurring more frequently. I would return it if it wasn't the only way to download prime videos. I will be going with another product next time."
"Exactly as described, works great"
"Cannot get my book account to work, nook. Not a real tablet, clunky design, bought a galaxy by Samsung 5 days later."
What a difference this makes in my life.  Don't know how I managed without it all this time.
"I can't really rate this 4th generation Kindle yet, as getting it up and running has been such a pisser.  Couldn't even take a picture because it said my memory was insufficient.  I bought 16gb on my first kindle, and 16gb on this kindle.  I probably have less stuff stored than any other single individual worldwide, yet I couldn't even take a picture.  I should be able to have 20 books, a couple of games, a few pics and my email programs work without getting error messages.  Oh, 'updated' gmail inbox doesn't show how to delete messages en masse.  When I called about that, the tech couldn't tell me to simply press the 'edit' link at top of page to reveal the checkboxes on left margin to make this happen!  Good Grief!  Luckily, I got an answer when I googled the problem.  Bought this upgraded kindle solely for the rear-facing camera, so I could do videos at sporting events.  Lets see if that can happen without a problem.  If so, I'll update this review.  PS:  hows about ya send a basic &#34;step one&#34; &#34;step two&#34; list that ANY level of user can get full benefit from their electronic device from amazon.  I still don't know how to stream a Netflix video (to anywhere).  I also tried to watch Bosch a few months back, thinking it was free. . . because it said it was free to prime members.  Can't watch a second episode so I just gave up!  Grrrrr"
I love it. Only one small issue. I wish the on/off button was more conveniently placed and easier tonpush.
Exactly as expected!
"Sharp images and easy to use,very compact.Big product in a little package."
"Got it during the Amazon Prime Day sale at $99.  This is my first tablet and I'm very happy and satisfied with it.  It's a basic tablet and reader and has a good battery life to it from what I've noticed so far.  I only got it to have around for random usage at home, internet browsing, playing music (Pandora app & Spotify app), watching YouTube (no app yet for it so you have to watch from YouTube.com), Prime Instant Video (I can save and watch videos offline so this helps for traveling and airplanes), and to watch porn in before I go to bed at night.  Does what I want it to do, no complaints.  My only wish is that I wish it was more customizeable as far as wallpapers and lock screens.  P.S.  As info - I saved Pulp Fiction and World War Z from Prime video offline viewing and I now only have 2gigs left, roughly.  Everything else is a few apps downloaded and the rest of the system memory."
"Still trying to work it,but I am enjoying it"
What was I waiting for?????? I had a 2nd generation Kindle fire 8.9 HD...and just received the new 7 inch HD.  Don't wait! Upgrade now! You will be happy you did. Awesome product and I highly recommend!
"I love it!!!! Long battery,fast , great!!!!"
"My 8 year old loves it. Great graphics for his games, education apps as well as the books. Great for the price too."
"got this for my husband, he loves it."
My mom loves this. Think I need one as well!
"We got this for our daughter's 7th bday. It does enough to keep her entertained. The battery life, however, is not ideal. The thing dies pretty quickly because most kids forget to remove apps from the carousel. Other than that, its pretty good for a young child."
"Besides the camera, there is practically nothing I like about this Kindle Fire more than my second generation Kindle. I don't like that Silk, the browser,  doesn't hold my most visited sites, but instead just offers Bing as a search engine. (I NEVER use Bing) Also, I don't like the way the music shuffles. If you're in shuffle mode and the second is the last song in you're library, the shuffle stops.  The battery doesn't last at all if you don't shut the Kindle down between uses which really sucks. With all that being said I do like the X-ray lyrics feature and all the extra references like Wikipedia and translation when looking up a word in a book. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who already had a Fire though."
I love the kindle line. If I were to purchase another one it would have to be an x. This 7 inconsiderably slower than the 7. The dual camera is a nice feature however the speed is definitely notably different.
My new &#34;Fire HD 7&#34; is nothing more than an expensive hand held billboard for ads. NO one warned me about this. I wish I had bought a tablet instead.
"Easy to use right out of the box.  Perfect for my needs.  Clear screen, plenty of memory."
Love that I didn't need to get it set up.  ready to go right out of box.
"I purchased this thinking that it would work like any other tablet.  In fact the technology is all up to par but because of Amazon and Google refuse to play nice, Amazon limits and controls our devices' permissions.  That means, no Android / Google Play Store apps.  If you rely on Gmail and Google Drive, your out of luck.  I hate when Apple pulls this &#34;stay in our ecosystem&#34; crap, but even my Mac syncs with my Android phone and PC desktop.  Not my Kindle Fire though. Along with no Play Store means no Snapchat, Instagram, Waze and mostly every other app you know and love.  I love amazon for purchases. I do 90% of my shopping though this site. But if Im going to write emails, keep a calendar, contacts, documents, etc etc, Im sticking with Google because they do it best.  And thats why tech companies need to let me chose how I use MY device, with the apps and functions I want, without them blocking me for their competitors.  Foreshame Amazon!"
Exactly what I expected love it
"I am still learning how everything works, but I am quite satisfied at this time."
Limited apps  after you are used to AppIe. I like everything else
"I love it, this is my first piece of technology, others have been helping me with how to use."
It's such a shame that such a nice piece of hardware is held back so much by horrible software.  Being closed into just the apps from amazon is not the greatest thing.  The games available remind me of the toy section of family dollar. Cheap knockoff versions of what you get from the Google store.  Nor do I understand why we are locked into amazons interface with ads on my lockscreen. Not impressed.
"The camera is not good, and it's not fast with some of the apps when I click on them. I have been a very good customer for Amazon for many years and now my kids are purchasing things also , so if you would like to send me a new Fire HD 8  I will take it<br />Thanks<br />Deidre"
It is all I thought it would be. Easy to begin and great in all aspects.  Get one you will really enjoy!!!
4 stars because there should have been an owners manuel with it. There was nothing to say what to do with it.
"I love it, this is my third or fourth Kindle."
Screen cracked first day. Not made to last. Found out after I bought they are expensive and difficult to repair. Wish I would have bought something else.
Does exactly what u wanted no more no less. Doesn't have all the bell and whistles of more expensive models but for the price provided the😃basics and good value.
Love Love Love this tablet!!! Perfect size
"Got in on sale, great price for a handy little tablet. I have a smartphone, a Kindle Paperwhite, a laptop and a PC. This was nice for the price, but don't expect it to suffice for all of your computing needs. It has surprisingly decent sound for a tablet, especially in this price range. I stream plenty of Netflix and Instant Video on here when I'm viewing alone. Much better than on my phone. I do wish Amazon allowed other browsers as Silk is not that great... Like I said, though. At this price, it's a great little device. Just don't expect lightening speeds while browsing."
"Too many ads. Also, would be better if Steam worked on it. I have an iPad mini and find that I use my iPad more. Should have magnification within color books, and should be able to do it without just blowing up pixels (resolution killer)."
work well but the battery life is not as long as desired
"love my new kindle fire, can't beat the deal! can'beat all that you can do on a kindle. I will always own one! (or two)"
"This is a great tablet. Very nice picture. Apps and videos play awesome. For the price, you can't beat it. My daughter loves it."
Nice
works nice
"My wife got this for my birthday,  I stayed up all night to fool around with it. I am sure glad she got this. Amazon prime is so cool, and it's not necessary to download songs or movies unless you're moving around."
Everything I wanted.
I bought this for my husband  not knowing if he would like it or no.He loves!!
I had an original Kindle Fire and this new Kindle Fire is much faster with a better screen. Love it! I use this more than my iPad.
"I got this as a gift for my wife and we have both been able to use it. The Kindle Fire HD is well designed, and flawless in every way possible straight out of the box. Amazon put a lot of love into their Kindle brand and the Fire HD shows this. It has a very easy to use interface with quick access to music, videos, apps and the Amazon store. I am so impressed I am considering ordering another one just for myself."
Better than expected.
"I love my Fire HD 7! I use it to read books, play solitaire, shop and with headphones on ( the sound and picture quality is great by the way) to watch shows in bed while my husband is sleeping (he has to be up early for work and works very hard). My husband loves that I do not need a light to read. This is my husbands better sleep solution, lol (I always tried to be considerate while he was sleeping, but sometimes he'd hear certain sounds on our t.v. or the light that I used for reading would bother him). Much less bulky than my laptop in bed! I also love the lenders library and that I got a good deal on this item on Prime Day! The ads do not bother me as much as I thought they would. Do not hesitate on this if you are considering- great little device!"
Just received my fire hd and find it easy to use and easy to carry
Touch screen response time is slow at times. I don't like the placement of the buttons
Useless..
"I hate the ads that I can't seem to get to go away, if that was the price of the discount it wasn't worth it..."
"am new at Fire HD7 but a, really enjoying the experience.  much more to learn"
Very happy with my new Kindle Fire HD7!
"What a great little tablet.  The price is right.  Brightness control allows it to be dark enough for bedtime viewing and bright enough for daytime use in the car or a brightly lit room.  The sound is nice and loud (louder than my nexus 7 and lenovo windows tablet).  The software could use some work and the app availability is somewhat less than on Google Play, but for what it is I'm ok with it.  Where I am actually disappointed (hence the 4 star rating and not 5) is the battery life.  This tablet only lasts 3 or 4 hours on a charge.  It should last 7+ hours to keep up with competitors.  It also burns through battery life when left in suspension (tablet on, screen off), so leave it plugged in when not in use.  When it goes on sale, it is a good value.  I would buy it again."
"I was lucky to snag this item during Prime Day. While I still need to get used to the user interface (as I'm normally an Apple person), this really does do everything I need it to do: mainly facebook and watching YouTube videos. You cannot beat the price considering how expensive Apple products are. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the camera is not the best... it doesn't come out as clear as my iPhone or iPad. If you are looking for a basic tablet, you can't beat this at this price."
"Would be nice to still get a small &#34;quick start manual&#34; or key features.  Doesn't really come with any information, and if you are sending it as a gift to someone older, it doesn't allow ease of use.  Also, not sure where or how you can get help or assistance like the old adds where you had the one button quick connect help that adds showed last year."
Great picture and much faster processor than previous versions. This is our 5th kindle HD and they keep getting better. The 16 GB has plenty of storage and our 6 year old is adding lots of games and pictures. It's a good size for smaller hands and these tend be more durable than iPads. Very happy with the purchase and Amazon platform so it's good for kids and accessing all the free content via Amazon Prime.
Love Love Love my new Fire Kindle
Not worth wasting your money on. It's slow and has a tendency to freeze up. Should have cancelled my order when I was informed Amazon sold me a product they didn't have in stock at the time of purchase.
"Although I use the tablet mainly for reading, it does have some excellent graphics and it's integration with Amazon is very handy."
"Love it, did not know it had a camera.  Surprised and Pleased"
Excellent value.  Limited phone apps.  Does not have TWC Phone 2 GO was disappointing..It would be nice to be able to use Google play apps without voiding the warranty. The email application is flaky. You never know if it will remove emails from the server upon downloads or not. Deleting them from the tablet may or may not delete them from the server. You can only delete mail messages one at a time.  If you use multiple devices you run this will result in mismanaging your email.  As a result I deleted my email account.
My new kindle is really to.use. The grafics are awesome.
They met me needs and expectations with no hesitations
Very nice device.
"Not great, freezes, games fail to upload, does not sync to last page read in Apple devices. Battery does not last."
It took almost 6 weeks to get.
I love my Kindle Fire.
"Very easy to learn how to use I am very pleased with fire HD 7,  I learn something else that it does everyday does more then I thought it would"
"I already owned the HD6 when I purchased the HD7.  When the HD7 was listed on sale during the Amazon Days, I couldn't resist.  The HD7 makes it a little easier to read my emails and watch my Amazon videos.  The downside is the battery power doesn't last as long as the HD6."
Battery life is poor. Amount of preloaded and unwanted apps is ridiculous.
"It worked fine for a few days, then it would not cut on."
"The Fire is my first experience with a tablet and I really love it!  Easy to set up and use, and my husband downloaded a book (our first book download ever) that he would have never read otherwise. I highly recommend this tablet for both novices and well-seasoned users."
Perfect reader.
Nice tablet performs well.
This is my second Fire. I gave my other one to my daughter when I got my iPad. I like the size of the Fire for reading and I wanted to borrow some books for trips. Also my grandchildren can use this when they visit.  My only critique is that as a left-handed person I wish the on button was centered or maybe it's just the cover I bought that puts it on the top right.
Love it!!
good
one of my better tablets
"My wife loves her new Fire HD7. She predominantly reads on it but I have also added some movies on it for our son to watch while in the car. The Fire HD7 is a well rounded device that allows for reading kindle books, watching movies (locally & streaming), social networking, and listening to music. I love that it has two speakers vs the one speaker in the HD6. The only thing I wish it retained from older fire tablets is auto brightness. Aside from that, it's a great tablet option."
"This unit just turns itself off. Won't come back on until you plug it in, even with 70% battery. Pain in the neck needing to be plugged in. I would not recommend this tablet. I took advantage of the sale on prime day. Still not worth needing to be plugged in. Anybody want to buy a tablet. This is for sale. Lol"
Doesn't hold a charge as long.
So far I love it but I wish I had access to Google based apps and more options in the app store.
Garage.  Won't contact to home network unless I use MAC.  Does not support IPhone.  I should have done more research.
"The display is clear and bright as advertised, but the screen is way too small for my liking. My iPhone screen is almost as large."
Love that is all I can say
*good quality screen (with a bit fingerprints marks need to clean between time to time)<br />*nice stereo speakers<br />*perfect size &  grip<br />*average battery life<br />*no overheat issues<br />*good price<br /><br />am giving this product 2 of 5 mostly of the software<br /># no play store<br /># poor apps in amazon app store<br /># restricted tablet<br /># amazon ads on locked screen<br /># launcher<br />#camera (3 of 10)<br />#small volume and power buttons<br /><br />thanks
"I received this Kindle Fire as a gift and as a first tablet, I'm generally happy with it. But there are also tons of cons for it which is making me anticipate another tablet for actual internet usage and save this strictly for eReading. Biggest disappointment is the fact that it doesn't connect to the Google Play store and seriously hinders which apps I can add. Seems most of the apps I want/like are not available from the Amazon store which renders most of my non-reading usage useless. Second biggest disappointment is how poorly this connects to wi-fi. It takes forever sometimes to connect to my home wi-fi and it drops way too easily. Say I'm connected but I step away from it for an hour, when I come back to it, I'll have to spend another 5-10 minutes trying to get it to reconnect again which is seriously annoying.<br /><br />However, as an eReader, I enjoy the different backgrounds and fonts that suit my likes, as well as the number of books I can load to it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a colored eReader, this gets a plus but for anyone who wants to use this as a respectable tablet too, I'd get something else for apps."
Love it so much. Quick speed to internet connection. Wonderful picture and different read settings.
"I should have researched more before I purchased this product, I hate how I can't transfer my videos to the device without making all my videos MP4. Not to mention it only has 11 gigs of space out of the package without a way to make it larger. I will be purchasing a different device and giving this one away as a gift."
Nice little gadget that was given to me because it was extra. I love it but it does seem to freeze up a lot .
Its a kindle what more is there to  say. Great tablet for its purpose.
Works ok
Works like a champ. My husband loves it.
"Easy to use and because I am a Prime Member, I was pleasantly surprised that it was already loaded with my account information and all the books I had on my previous Kindle! Literally I just unpacked and it was ready to go. Thank you Amazon."
Slow. Will not recommend it to others.
I waited for a while to get one.. glad I did. the glare can be difficult while reading sometimes but I like it.
"I purchased this for a gift.  She absolutely loves it, uses it every evening."
love it
"Really love my new fire, it was so easy to upgrade all my books, games and pictures all transferred to my device.<br />I am so glad I picked Amazon for my tablet.<br />Thank You"
Very happy with it. It does a lot more than the Nook Color that we have. So far so good!
"Its no Nexus, but it works"
Still trying to figure out what all it can do for me. Like it so far!!
Have used it some but my main purpose is to use in with the Echo. It works like I expected but was hoping to use it for multiple lists not JUST Shopping and To-do lists. The battery duration is a little less than I expected. It was advertised at about 8 hours. Mine is more like 6 hours. The documentation (Manuals and help) leave much to be desired.
"I bought this on Prime Day and received it two days later.  The first few days it worked alright, it was a little slow when I did anything besides reading books, even checking my email.  I knew I would only be able to download apps from the Amazon store but as I had never used it before I was unaware how limited it was.  After 5 days (Yes, 5!!!) the screen became stuck on landscape mode.  I tried everything I could think of to fix it but nothing helped so I finally contacted customer service.  After repeating everything I'd already done (turning screen rotation on & off and turning the device on and off) they told me we would have to do a factory reset.  I attempted to do the factory reset while still on the phone with customer service and the screen just froze on the loading screen.  After waiting several minutes the customer service rep said he had done everything he could and they would send me a replacement.  I received the replacement quickly but this one only worked for one day before messing up in a completely different way.  The screen partially froze, I could click on some things but pretty much nothing reacted .  I couldn't open or close anything at all.  I couldn't even get the device to shut off!  After setting the device down and leaving it for about 20 minutes to talk to someone from customer service again I came back to find the bottom half of the screen completely black.  You could still see the image on the top half of the device but the bottom half was all black.  At that point I decided to return the device and not try a 3rd time.<br /><br />I am aware that these things happen sometimes with devices (odd that it happened to 2 of mine) so I am not giving it a 1 star.  Also, Amazon Customer Service was very helpful during the whole thing and they made the process bearable."
"I bought this to replace my old Kindle Fire.  I'm very happy with the product, the HD display is impressive.  It does everything I need it to do."
Works perfectly for my needs but is a little heavy.
"Easy to use and has multiple uses for teenager (books and games), pre-schooler (educational games), classroom use (online edu. games and easy storage)!"
"This budget tablet far exceeds the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and the Lenovo A1000.  It has better sound, way better video and the interface is much smother and easier to use that the other two mentioned.  This is the best 7&#34; tablet I have tried excluding the iPad Mini.<br />Two cons:<br />1. The adds that are run when you first turn the tablet on but hey I can live with that for $80 (Amazon Black Friday in July) compared to $140 - $200 for all the others in the same price range.<br />2. Lack of a mini SD slot.  The 8GB internal memory is more than enough for my use but compared other two that had limited 1gb of internal memory that filled up quickly even though you could move some of the apps to the miniSD.  This meant that I had to constantly move and delete stuff to keep the other two from filling up.<br />I know that the others mentioned are older models but they were disappointing out of the box.  I actually use this tablet for home and basic work application and have been exceedingly pleased with the purchase.  I'm sure there are comparable 7&#34; tablets out but not for the same price unless the other major brands have stepped up significantly.  Note that I also in-store tested the HP, Asus Memo and LG versions and although they were marginally better than the two listed they were also $50 more at the time.  From my internet research of the all 7&#34; tablets this got some of the best overall reviews in the price range. Do the research and decide for yourself."
So far it looks like a great machine.
"I love my Fire HD 7 with 7&#34; display, I still have yet to learn everything about it but it's so lightweight , easy to read, clear and crisp visually."
I love love love it!!!!!!
I am very excited about my new kindle HDX I'm sure I will enjoy it as much as I did my first kindle hd.
"While I got this on sale and really wanted a tablet the kindle fire has plenty of reasons to make me regret getting this even at the low price I got it at. I guess my chief complaint is the lock screen, I don't want to see your dumb ads for apps and products I don't want Amazon, I already purchased your tablet leave me alone. Another big problem I have is the amazon app store itself. Maybe having an android for years spoiled me because the google play store is by far superior, if you use play store or Apple app store then switching to amazon app store will drive you insane. Not only do they not have the games and apps I love and use, they bombard you with sub quality apps and games and  they all heavily utilize in game purchasing (maybe just the ones I checked out and possibly a problem with the phone game and app business in general but still upset me). The last big point I have to make is the lack of customization allowed. You basically can't customize anything, as I mentioned before the lock screen is always some ad amazon is throwing in your face, but the home screen also cannot be changed, just a black screen with your app icons there. I really wish, like my phone and my brothers tablet, you could add your own pictures or even change the app icons themselves, but alas I'm stuck with this sub par tablet. Anyways, sorry I rambled but I needed to get that all off my chest. Definitely going to get an Apple or Samsung next time."
Love it...
I'm very pleased with it so far.
"Nice little tablet.  I had an 7&#34; hd before.  I find this one a little sensitive, but it is nothing I can't handle. I would purchase it again."
Great tablet for the price! I do just about everything I need to do that my daughter does on her iPad. So that fact that I paid about 80% less is a win.
Free time on the Kindle is wonderful for young kids.  Makes it very easy to limit what they have access to.
I love the case very easy to use and has a bend back so you could set it on the table and read hands free.
I love it
"Purchased this during Amazon Prime Day. Was hoping for a Kindle but it was sold out. Opted for a Fire HD. However reading books on the lowest settings is still too bright. Option? Purchase a $1 app to dim the light. Cheap solution? Yes. Bad Principle? Yes. This should have been pre built into the system. Unless I'm blind and didn't see it nor find any other feedback online, Amazon customer service was not able to assist me in the solution. Just created a return label if I wanted a refund.<br /><br />I tried giving it another shot to see if I liked using the Fire HD and haven't really been able to pick it up. I wasn't looking to use it for the tablet functionalities such as other apps etc.,<br />Will be sending back and revert to reading printed books."
Bought this for my husband who was always using his phone to play games and go on Facebook.  He absolutely loves it.  Perfect size for him.
"Overall great device, just wish more apps were available on the Amazon App Store or that you could use Google apps on it since it is an Android."
"I just wish it charged faster. Other then that My only problem, is that my 12 year old keeps borrowing it! Lol"
This item has issues which causes my grandson to have to reboot.
Wonderful
"Love it, it works perfectly. No issues with it at all."
love it
Not working very well.  I need to keep restarting it because it keeps freezing up.
Works great
Great as always. Just what I expected from Kindle!
"This did not come with a manual.  I need one to be able to refer to and I can't even download one.  I am returning this item. For those of us who are not that computer saavy, it is a pain in the neck.  I have enough computerized things to learn how to operate without my reader being one of them."
This is the best tablet for a kid. I got mine during the Black Friday in July sale and the value is amazing. Do yourself a favor and skip the Nabi and Nabi Jr and just buy this one.
Everything I wanted and expected.  :) excellent choice for a tablet (especially if you are already a prime member)!
"The same as it's predecessor.  I thought I was ordering an upgraded version of my Kindle Fire with better sound, etc.  But this is exactly the same.  I sent it back.  There is nothing wrong with the predecessor except the volume leaves a bit to be desired when you're listening to books."
"So far so good.  The previous Kindle that I have does not hold a charge and stopped working after 7 months.  So far, this Kindle is holding a charge and works well."
I brought it for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it!!!
Very pleased with item but disappointed that I  paid extra to opt out of special notices but receive them anyway.
"i am an older senior citizen. stiff fingers and poor eyesight and very little tech ability.. i have  own edthe fire 2nd. gen for several years  and absolutely love it. i bought the fire 4th. gen ONLY  to be able to take pictures and email them. i found the advertisements that are there agrevating  and so paid 15.00 plus tax to eliminate them. that said, here is what i found. the toggles for on and off and sound are very narrow and do not raise very high and so are very hard to feel and operate. add the case and its really hard. i checked the sound and its good. willy sounds pretty good.  colors are good  and speed is adequate. i went to the users guide and found they automatically assume you know more than you do. first it is not google. you cant put in a question and get an answer. you must put in the subject only, for instance. camera, then you get the entire camera section and have to read it all to find your answer. mostly its there and i found a few things i didnt even know  to ask. same with every thing else. in an earlier time i was a photographer so appreciate good pictures,.. these are adequate but be careful in bright light. i couldnt see where the enhancement feature did much at all. im going to just be satisfied with what it is and use it. i still cant find out how to send more than 1 picture at a time. but someone somewhere will tell me some time. for now my family gets lots of email. anybody got a bright 5 year old they will lend me for a while?"
Love it !!! Had a kindle paper white and wanted to upgrade
It's been great so far. I appreciate the larger screen and the HD.
"I purchased this for my father, who has no earthly idea how to work a computer smart phone or tablet. All the man wants to do is play games, watch movies and watch porn. So far, I've been able to show him how to download game apps. Even though he still thinks yelling at the Kindle will enable him to play better, he seems to enjoy it. We are taking baby steps into Netflix, but I'm sure he will yell at the Kindle for that too."
The battery power does not last very long.  I watch about 2 hours of shows on it a nite and by morning it is completely dead.  I have only had it for about 3 weeks.
Works well for me
"This replaced my Kindle Fire HD (2012) that died just a few months out of extended warranty.  The plastic back is chintzy when compared to the 2012 model,  but no matter since I keep mine in a leatherette protective case.  I love that it will go to sleep when I close the case, then wake up as soon as I open it.  Another big improvement is that you can actually see what you are photographing instead of having to guess.  Having the volume and power buttons in different locations is an improvement, as is having the charging port at the top instead of the side.  Same great Dolby sound and HD screen!  It would be nice to have a slot for an SD card....<br />I love my Fire HD 7 -- even more so because I bought it on Prime day for $60.00 off!"
"UPDATED (Aug 31) - I have completed 3 trips with the Fire HD now, and I have some updated observations: 1. PRO - Amazon Prime and this thing are a GREAT combo. I have downloaded movies and TV shows for the plane, it is a good size to use on the plane or in an airport. Not bulky like a laptop, a little smaller than an iPad. great for the tray on the plane with enough room for your drink and peanuts(!). The fact that I get to download Prime Videos as part of my Prime membership is a huge plus. 2. PRO - Sound is good, I used them with a cheap set of earbuds, an average set of noise cancelling headphones and a great set of earbuds. Sound was good on all. 3. PRO - Picture/screen is better than I thought it would be. Video is crisp, no chop or stutter on playing video. 4. PRO - I bought the Amazon case with the fold back stand. Works very well, keeps the unit at a good viewing angle. Buttons and earphone jack are easily accessible. 5. PRO - Battery seems to be better than originally thought. Fully charged I can easily watch two movies on a plane trip if needed. Does nto lose its charge overnight all the time. 6. CON - It still seems to be a little flaky. I watched 2 episodes of Bosch (watch this Amazon Prime series!) on a flight, then changed planes. I closed the cover to sleep it and when I got on the next plane I had to hold the power button for about 30 seconds then power it back on. Will be calling Amazon about this when I get a chance. 7. CON - Just a little thing but sometimes the ads get in the way of the game play.  Overall I can give it a solid 3. If I get the flakiness worked out with the locking up (only thing I can call it), I would change it to 3 1/2. Worth the $99 I paid for it, not sure if I would pay $159 for it.  Well I finally grabbed a Kindle FireHD on Prime Day. I have 4 iPads, 2 Android tablets, and 1 Asus Win8 tablet, and a Surfacec Pro 3 tablet. I got the Fire for Plex and Amazon Prime. Received my Fire on Aug 4, could not use it until Aug 7.  My early thoughts are  - Meh. Not any kind of special tablet. I will list my pros and cons:  Pros Size is about right for a really portable tablet (not thickness, but width and height) Amazon prime gets to download movies/TV shows for offline viewing All (most) of my FireTV apps can be used, don't have to repay Sound is pretty good, slightly better than the iPad speaker. Have not tried with earphones yet, like I will be using on a plane Can read my Kindle books on it (Thats about it for pros, will update if I think of more)  Cons Weight - with the Amazon case it weighs just 4.3oz less than my full size iPad Air 2 with the Apple case, without case it is 5.2 oz less. Also uncomfortable holding in one hand to read Size - this thing is pretty thick. Hey Amazon, thin is in. Thickest tablet I own Battery life - not very good at all. Have had to recharge it every morning since I received it, it runs completely down overnight, despite having about 35% battery when I go to bed. If it continues I will contact Amazon support, as battery life is nothing like what is advertised. Slow - a very sluggish device. Not as bad as my other Android tablet but nowhere near what my iPad air is. Angry Birds took a full 55 seconds to load after a complete reboot. Not good. I am going on a couple of trips over the next few weeks and will be updating after I get back. Overall it is really a 2 1/2 star device but Amazon only allows whole stars. I spent 99 bucks on it so not really a huge deal, but for someone spending $159 for it (and STILL have to put up with the ads at that price) it will be a 1 star, in my opinion."
Good
Love my Fire HD tablet. Great value!  Sold my sluggish Samsung tablet for this.
"So far, so good.  Coupled with AmazonPrime membership, this device has allowed me to interact with more media than ever before.  I'm reading more, listening to the Amazon Prime radio offerings, and exploring shows and movies I wouldn't normally try.  Great device and glad I got it when it was on sale."
"Have amazon prime, don't understand why I go to amazon music and it shows my personal songs and not only amazon songs, can't download videos for my kids?"
My 2nd kindle and I love it just as much as my original
"My daughter is 9 and she has had an iPad since she was 5, but when she got the Fire HD 7 she could not put it down. Great product!"
"Great product. I wanted something to surf around the house other than my phone or a big expensive tablet. The Fire meets all my needs and was under $120.00. Easy to setup and since I'm a Prime member, the apps and shopping are a breeze."
Love this device
"Wow! My Kindle Fire 7 exceeded my expectations. It's crystal clear screen has vivid colors. It's quick. It worked right out of the box, no registration, set up required, it was already linked to my Amazon account. My Prime Media was available with just a password entry. My family is starting to miss me...."
"Just got it a few days ago, would be nice to have instructions/manual that is not an additional cost. The online manual feels a bit cumbersome to me. Searching &#34;Help&#34; is not always easy, would be nice if it were as smart as Google or iPad. Not major stuff. It is fast, sharp and I'm sure we'll be friends soon."
I love my Kindle Fire.  Easy to read and operate. Good visuals and fast.
"I'm still learning how to use it.  but, so far so good."
Great tablet for the price. The only thing I don't like is the ads that appear whenever I turn the tablet on or awake it from sleep. Other than that it's a great product
"It's my first experience and it was a good one. My wife bought a Nook for our grandson, and she's had two Nooksack of her own. After she saw my Fire, she bought on for herself."
"So happy with this device!  Researched it, and found it to live up to and exceed my expectations!  Easy to use, powerful, plenty of storage, so many uses and options.  Amazon Kindle help staff are awesome too!"
Replacing older version. So handy.
"I own an original Kindle, which I still love for reading. But the Kindle Fire is awesome! It's great for watching movies and shows, music, kids books. So SIMPLE to operate, and fun to play around with!"
Love it
Was just what I wanted.  This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it.
This is the second in the house.  We love them.
Great value. Love the hdmi capability.  Prefer the Fire over my smartphone.
"Right now it is only a one star because it seems to be too complicated for me to use.  Yes, I can play games and read a book, but I don't know how to get my email or any other contacts set up.  I could do that with my other kindle.  I know that you put things online for explanations, but you have to be more computer literate to understand what you are talking about. I know that I am old, but to tell you the truth, sending a small user manual with items like this would help."
"Before I had received the Fire HD 7, I would've never actually wanted to do my reading summer assignment.  But because professional narration comes with almost every book, I finished a 263 page book in 4 days!"
Its fast enough and problem free.
I have had at least 5 Kindle products.  I started out with the reader when they first came out.  A year later my husband bought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas.  It died in the hot tub (husband didn't see that it was sitting on the open cover) so I got it replaced with the warranty.  After that one my best friend got one and put it on my account so we can share our books (we like the same kind of books).  Recently I bought another one (this one) and gave my older one to my 10 year old grandson for his birthday.  He loves it as much as I love mine.  I log onto the local library and borrow books. I use it to go online and locate whatever I need. I use it to watch shows while I walk on my treadmill.  It uses Wifi only but you can find Wifi almost anywhere nowadays so it is rarely a problem.  I take my Kindle with me everywhere I go and don't know what I would do without it.
"Hard to see screen out in day light, have to tilt, there is still a glare, tuff to read by the pool."
Bought this on your Black Friday sale during July. The price was amazing and it was a gift for my 70 year old mom. So far it has been simple enough for her to operate and she is enjoying the ability to play a few games as well as read her books. The best part is that it is small and light enough for her to hold.
I have been an iPad user for a long time.  The 7&#34; kindle fire is changing that.  The Fire does everything I do on the iPad. It is lighter and easier to carry.  So far totally pleased and would highly recommend especially at the price.
Our household owns 3 kindle's. We use them all the time. My kids love the amazon prime videos and they can share apps. We now that the Fire Stick for our TV and we can watch the videos and stream from the Kindle Fire to the TV the applications or videos.  I also have an I-Pad. but the fire gets more use. The screen has a nice display and is user friendly. My daughter knew how to work the kindle at 2 years old
"This replaces my original Kindle Fire.  The new one is much sharper, faster and has many more features than the old one. I am still trying to figure out some things, but much of it is pretty intuitive.  I love it."
Very quick and beautiful display for a small device.
"This kindle is replacing my original Kindle Fire.  I like this version, but there are few changes I don't like.  One thing is on the original Fire when it was charging you could tell when it was fully charged by seeing the light go green.  On the new version, there is no light so you need to continue to check.  Also, when the Kindle is on sleep mode advertisements rolling across the screen.  I'm not a fan!<br />When watching a video ---WOW! what a difference from the original.  It makes all of the other imperfections meaningless.  The sound, color and graphics are great.<br />Other than the few negatives, I do like the new edition but wished I would have gotten a larger screen.  My next purchase will be a larger screen.  But when I call Amazon support when the original had problems, the tech was so helpful and positive.  This is one reason I will continue to buy Amazon products. 5 stars for support."
Great and perfect size for my two year old
Easy and fun to use!!!
Great value. Quality tech.
Love the fire hd 7. More than I expected.
Nice product. Easy to use
Nice but wrong one
"I did not think It would be as good as it is sound wise, I am having so much fun with this product."
I love the kindle fire.  This is my second one.  I bought it to replace an old nook but it does so much more.  The most reliable tablet for the price.  The only thing I dislike is the Silk browser.
I like the new one just getting use to
"It came when was expected and its a great upgrade from the kindle. I like it very much. It took a little time to get it started, but the directions were clear and easy."
It took 3 weeks to receive it but worth the wait.
It exceeds my expectation!!
Kids love the pink
love it!!!!!
"Considering I bought this for 99 dollars, I have to rate it a 5. Perfect size, and the sound quality was great. I can leave it on Pandora and do what I need to do around the house. I have now pretty much quit using my phone to text at home, because the feel of typing on this is much better(Perfect size). If I had to say one negative thing about this tablet, it would be that I would have liked it to have an HDMI port, which I thought it had upon purchasing it. Not a big deal though. I  recommend this product 100%. If I had to buy another one even for full price I would."
"I love it, I take every where"
Great reader and streamed movies<br /> Little slow because of our WiFi bandwidth caused a lot of buffering but overall great traveling companion
Battery life is less than stated.  A bit disappointing.  I like my original Kindle much better.
Forthcoming....
"This tablet is great for book nerds like myself. The image is clear and the tablet is fast. Great camera and features. I am a little disappointed by the app store. It doesn't carry a lot of common apps such as Instagram. I wish it had the Google Play Store and matched up with my Google account more. If certain apps and social media are not all that important to you, then this is definitely a great tablet."
Cons<br />Battery seemed to drain quickly.<br />It took a while to load a website or open an app.<br />No 5Ghz WIFI support<br />Touch Screen not as responsive as other devices I own or have owned<br /><br />Pros<br />Good if you just wanted to use it as an E-Reader.<br />Nice screen<br />Sturdy Construction
easy to handle lightweight loaded with options best yet
Love this. Great  device.  Great clarity. Movies / books are awesome
Love the step up!
"The Kindle Fire HD is an excellent product.  I am thrilled with the abilities of the Fire HD to run books, games and internet access, just to name a few of its features.  As an e-reader its size is just right for comfort while using and makes a great travel accessory, whether its on vacation or just to the doctor's office. I would happily recommend this to a friend."
Everything went ass planned.
I may be doing or not doing something with my new Kindle: I thought that my Words w/Friends and other games would transfer over but it doesn't appear that's the case. When entering my password on the e mail it returns with not correct password. Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated. Love the size and happy with the cover.
Not much different from my Fire.  I need to learn to navigate differently.<br />I like the clearer and sharper picture.  I was hoping that it would be lighter than my other two.  Other than that I love it.
Love it. This is my third Kindle . They just keep getting better.
So happy to have a new kindle that works .
Keeps my kids entertained and is easy to operate.
"This is my first mobile device and I really enjoy using it. It is fairly easy to operate, but I am still learning"
I love it!
I love it
so far its great !!!
VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!
"Really handing.  Still getting use to the size, larger than my phone yet smaller than my laptop and pc."
Love it so far.
Very happy with the kindle fire.  Very easy to set up.  Great purchase.
"This is my third Kindle and I love it. Great color, easy to use, easy to handle."
Love my new Kindle Fire. My daughter has one and travels with it rather than carrying her laptop. That is what I plan to do. Very happy with it.
first timer for one of these and relatively easy to figure out.  good price.
great product.
I'm really enjoying the sleek design of the Kindle HD 7.  My only wish is that I could use Google Hangouts on it.
"I've always wanted a new tablet and this fit the bill perfectly, not too large. It has a nice resolution, wonderful sound. It does most of my apps that my phone does a lot better."
I am very pleased with the Kindle.  It is exactly what I need to carry with me wherever I go.  Thanks for the great deal.
"The battery life on this sucker is the WORST.  I'm lucky if I get two hours of run time out of it.  It's faster than my old tablet, but the battery life is seriously restrictive.  Shoulda bought an iPad"
I have not used it to the fullest. It has met my expectations.
"No problems on my profile(main account), but when I setup my daughter's profile it appears to have trouble switching between mine and hers. The screen was also not displaying correctly. I ended up deleting her profile and re-creating it. It so far seems to be doing okay, but I don't want to jinx myself."
"As far as the actual product itself I love it and it is perfect. As far as being unable to keep all devices on one account (to share the prime membership) but with their own separate cloud storage stinks. I have 3 kindle fire hd's and the fire phone, with all 4 devices on one account the apps show on all devices as well as photos. So be aware of that fact before buying more than one."
Like it very much.
Basically using it as a kindle reader and it has all the features I like in a reader. Able to read in bed without the lights on and use a black backround which is easier on the eyes.
Loved it
"Just learning how to use it, but love it so far. It's the first time I've ever had a touch screen anything so it's been fun and challenging."
Terrific!
"Not nearly as easy to use as a reader as the Nook.  There aren't as many options to set the page color and brightness either.  Does give more book options to purchase and they are cheaper.  Like it, but would been happier with another Nook."
"I was quite happy with my Fire HD7, but since I  didn't use it for a few days it is now asking for a PIN to unlock and use it. I have no recollection of having a PIN in the first place. I have tried multiple times to get assistance from www.amazon. com/devicesupport and I get a message that the page is unavailable."
"This is a good, highly readable tablet with a lot of great options for readers (which is what I bought the device for). However, there are way too many ads, including some with explicit content, and the battery life is terrible+ the charger is inefficient."
Arrived very quickly. Ok packaging. Great product.
"Daughter loves it, she's happy I'm happy..."
"Nice product, much faster than our first Kindle, at a great price."
Very happy with my purchase.  Resolution of screen makes everything crystal clear and vibrant!
"This is my second Kindle Fire.  I had a first generation for 3.5 years (still have it after having defective charging port replaced).  This one certainly is a few steps up.  It is faster, and I don't have the problems accessing internet sites like I did with the old one such as Google Drive.  What can I say, I am a fan of Kindle Fires, and this one is very nice."
"We purchased this Kindle Fire HD 7 as a prize for a recruiting contest in our church youth group. The young lady that won was ecstatic. You'd have thought we gave her a million dollars! Beforehand, we loaded it full of preteen-friendly apps and books. Downloading was simple and quick. The Kindle has great speed, a super clear screen, and comes packaged nice and secure. I'm looking forward to eventually getting one of these for myself, too!"
"This product did so much more than I realized. Wow. Love it. Got it for reading, but now I do everything on it. :-)"
This kindle actually performs better than any of my kindles and I have six. I just wish it was bigger like my HD  and HDX
Love kindle fire..but can't find a case I am sure will fit..with on..off and volume button visible in the right places.....updated Kindle Fireh has even more good features...
love
It is a great value for use of amazon services. The use for email and other apps not bad but not as great.
A great kindle for reading and viewing videos
"Cons:<br />Amazon App store leaves a lot to be desired compared to the other big three (Windows, Android, Apple).<br />I keep finding myself hitting the home button while typing which is pretty annoying.<br />Inability to change the background with a photo of my choosing.<br />Pros:<br />If you have Amazon Prime, this tablet works pretty good with Instant Video and all of the services you get with Amazon Prime.<br />The keyboard is fluid, doesn't seem to lag at all.<br />Battery life is very good."
"I am still not sure about this Kindle.  I'm a big Kindle user...this will be my 4th one, but I  had some problems with it initially and haven't had much time to see if I can iron them out.  I don't like the advertisements, but can overlook them."
"still learning what it can do, but so far i love it"
Looks and works well
great
It's much like the original 7&#34; only I have an Issue with Battery life. My original battery would last easily 4 to 5 days doing light email and research. I suppose because of the enhanced screen and speed it suffers longevity. i still find Kindle the best Tablet so far the 7&#34; I mean. I also have the 8.9 K&#34; Kindle and A 7&#34; Nexus. Kindle 7&#34; HD Fire top of the list. Would buy again and do recommend.
worked fine
wanted one for awhile and glad i found it at  special price
Couldn't be better
"I like this kindle, but it periodically freezes up and I have to reboot it to get it to work again. I read other similar posts and wonder why amazon hasn't fixed this bug yet? It seems to me they should have figured it out by now."
It has exceeded my expectationsthis is better than the kindle HD I purchased 2 year s ago
Love it. Great for reading!
"I was very, very disappointed with this purchase! I love Amazon and I love my KINDLE ! This was my fourth kindle purchase and I purchased this on July 15....prime day. The deal looked great. I already own the HD 7 , previous generation so I wanted to get one for my husband. There were delays in shipping but there was compensation($20credit). When it arrived I noticed that it is much lighter than my previous one but not in a good way. It seemed like a much cheaper version of my old one! I also was not able to download some of the same apps that were installed on my other kindle. I emailed customer service and was told that this model kindle fire could not download those apps. I have already returned this latest kindle purchase! Very, disappointing!"
LOVE IT SO FAR!
"We've now had this Kindle for 4 months and my daughter still loves it as much as she did the day we bought it to replace her old one. It's slim and lightweight.  The front and rear facing cameras are a definite improvement over her old fire.  Although she rarely reads on it, she uses it daily, pretty much like she would a phone if she had one. She uses various apps, watches movies and shows,  and skypes with friends. I'm glad we chose to stick with the Kindle instead of switching to another brand."
It shuts down constantly. I am not happy with this and will never buy another one. I will not recommend the Kindle to anyone.
"Works well for downloading some prime movies locally.  This is the only reason I would recommend it.  Otherwise, not as nice of an interface as the iPad."
I love it even more than I thought I would.  I am still learning some of the apps but it isn't difficult. I also loved the price since I got it on your Amazon Prime day.
We got this for our 10 yr old son as a promise for his straight A grades. He loves it! He plays games and reads books. His two favorite things :)
Ordered on flash sale for my mom. My mom loves it. She had a laptop now uses this. And she is elderly. Has no trouble operating the kindel.
"Got this at a great price, works better than my iPad mini that has constant connectivity problems."
Bought for wife.  She is an avid reader and loves it.
Love it!!
It just plain works.
"Arrived way earlier than expected, clear image, tons of space and very quick to respond. I have to learn all the features, because there are upgrades over the older Kindle that I own. Nice size, nice images, slick looking device, nothing to complain about."
VERY GOOD OVERALL AT A VERY GOOD PRICE
had problems adjusting font and screen color  still working on that problem
My eight year old daughter loves this item.  It is so perfect for her now and hoping it will grow with her at least through the end of middle school.
"I've used both this and fire HD 6. They have very good performance. Screen is brighter and more color-accurate. But seeing a repeat incident of embedded specks on the surface of the screen for both Fire tablets makes me wonder if I should have gotten a screen protector, or it may be a property of the screen. I've have not conducted any stress tests, but this seems to be the case, because I still have older models that do not exhibit this condition. I also found a dead pixel."
Works great 5 yr old loves it
Does not connect to all wifis. Otherwise it's great
I love it.... but waited about 4weeks to get it.  Thought that a bit too long.
It works great.  It's easy to download purchases.  My only issue is the charger no matter what I do it usually takes me like a minute to plug the charger into the Kindle. I even had my husband and kids try and they experience the same thing.
"I suppose for the price, you get what you pay for.  The internet is slow and they always have a bunch of ads on everything.  Even the keyboard and search features are not user friendly.  I think i would give this to a kid instead of an iPad for the price, but for me, I will just have to get a new ipad:(  Bummed at the lack of Amazon quality"
"I really wanted to love the Fire HD 7 but you get what you pay for. I've been using the device for over a month now and am left feeling disappointed. In a word, it's clunky - From the feel and aesthetics to the operating system.<br /><br />What I liked: price point, easy access to Amazon Prime benefits<br /><br />What I disliked: no virus protection, slow and sometimes unresponsive<br /><br />Within the first month I had a virus. A VIRUS! To some this may not be shocking but I've never had a virus on my PC or iPad so was pretty disappointed in this. Frankly, I did not know what to do. I tried to &#34;Bing&#34; it using the devices default browser but had no luck. I emailed Amazon customer support directly from my Fire but didn't receive a response. So I tried calling and had someone on the phone right away. Unfortunately, this customer service experience was highly disappointing. I explained my issue and concern with the devices virus protection and was given a response that left me feeling responsible for the virus. He stated that the likely culprit was a web site I visited or an app I downloaded. Ultimately, they concluded that the only solution was reset to factory defaults. Meaning the device is wiped and I'm left to set it up again. No apology or suggestions on how to prevent this were offered. Or maybe it was just lost in translation because it was an offshore call center.<br /><br />The user interface is frustrating. Constantly slowing down and freezing.<br /><br />In the end, I won't complain because you get what you pay for. I also would not recommend this to my friends or family."
I have been using a Fire 6 and wanted a little larger screen. I have been very pleased with the Kindle Fire.
Wonderful!!!!! NN
"Very nice, easy to use. Good graphics and audio."
item was delivered on time in adequate packaging.  Have only been using for about a week but no complaints so far.
I love it so far
Nice tablet for the price
"I like the actual Amazon Fire.  What I didn't like was not getting it until 3 weeks after I ordered.  Also, having to on-line chat and then talk to Customer Service to even get started.  I could not connect to Wi-fi.  After several conversations, it was determined the problem was the Kindle had the wrong time and date.  Once this was changed, I was able to connect.  It was frustrating.  The Kindle seems very user friendly.  I like the touch screen much better than the keyboard on the old one I had."
Excellent
I like Fire!
It's only been a few days but so far it has met my expectations and I am pleased with it.
I have never been so inundated with ads from every direction! I would be angry if I hadn't won this for free at work. I feel bad for anyone who paid for theirs.
"A great device for games, light web surfing, emailing etc.  A little heavy as an e-reader though.  With a device protector installed it is a little difficult to swipe to close a book and go back to home screen.  Screen is bright and easy to see.  The 16 GB memory keeps it zipping along fairly quickly."
"It is all and more than I expected.  I can do a lot, even able to print something.  I like the size and it is light weight."
I would like the lock screen to have images like the kindle fire. There are things I like about both of the kindles.
"When my tried and true Kindle Touch stopped working (no one in tech dept could tell me why), Amazon sent me this new Fire at a SLIGHT discount because they couldn't fix my Touch.  My Touch had the flat, non-backlit display which was great and practically made the kindle disappear as I read and became engrossed in my novel.  Worked great in any light and especially well on the beach or by the pool.  Just needed a small book light to read the Touch in bed at night.  The Fire solved the reading in the dark problem as the backlit screen brightness could easily be adjusted.  For all other reading environments, however, the Fire just wasn't as good as the Touch and glare is a big problem (unless you buy an add-on screen cover which I haven't yet tried because it's annoying that you have to pay for all these add-ons (including the Fire cover)).  Furthermore, I just don't need another device to access the internet on top of my smart phone, laptop, desktop, and iPad! If you just want an e-reader for all your books, I would rather recommend the Kindle Touch!"
"I can't find a downside to this product, love it and use it daily."
"Love my Kindle Fire! Only small tablet I've owned but, I've heard the headaches my daughter's Galaxy 5 has caused her. I've rarely have an issue and the minor ones I've had are generally easy to resolve."
"I ordered this on prime day for $79. It was such a good deal and I have been very happy with my Fire phone so I was excited. I used it one time and it worked pretty good although it was a little difficult to tell if apps were closing. The device was fully charged and when I used it a second time and after less than three hours usage I logged onto the internet and the device froze up and stayed that way for at least 12 hours. No matter how many times I tried, I could not turn it off or get any kind of reaction. Eventually the screen went blank and will not turn back on.<br /><br />I am returning it and now I have serious doubts about the reliability of my Fire phone. I would hate to have it freeze up when I really need it.  The HD 7 comes in a pretty black and orange box just like my phone did, but unlike my phone it was shipped in a flimsy tight plastic bag with no bubble protection similar to the way a bank ships a box of checks. What a let down! Don't buy one!"
"Part of the problem was I didn't do my homework.  I just got a Windows phone which I really like but I miss all the apps I had with my android or iPhone.  I was looking at the Kindle White when I save the Fire on sale, thinking this would solve my apps problem and give the apps I can not get on my Windows phone.  BUT I found that you can only download apps from the Amazon store and not from Google store. Of the 7 apps I can not install on my Windows phone I was only able to install Amazon Music.  As a Kindle device I'm happy but as a Android device I'm not."
"Love my Kindle!  It has everything I need and works just like I need it to. My husband's tablet died, so I gave him mine and ordered me a Kindle. Very happy with my purchase!"
Still not much help for dry eye ....
"It's a lot lighter than my first Kindle, and definitely has more capabilities, I love the color ( Cobalt blue  ) the hd pictures, skype and more...."
I like this tablet. Its awesome !!!
Love it cannot put it down. Best purchase I ever made
Love it ! Made my grandsons very happy
Perfect for college or school
Well worth the price.  I purchased the Fire HD 7 to acclimate myself to more &#34;tech devices&#34;.  It is a more affordable option than purchasing similar competing brands by hundreds of dollars.  My only concern with the Fire HD 7 is that all of my Kindle purchases were linked to the Fire but the one book purchase I made on the Fire did not link to my Kindle (?).
Awesome
For the price it's not bad but the SoC is pretty slow. It ran Tales from the Borderlands but was choppy at times making the quick time events difficult sometimes.
Thank you very much. Received said item in excellent condition.
"The best tablet, amazon is amazing"
Constantly freezes and have to reboot!
With this being my first experience with a tablet I am pleasantly surprised. It's a lot faster then I expected and the battery life is excellent.
"excellent quality, i like it"
This. Is a great little tablet. Unfortunately it is tied to the Amazon app store which has only a small fraction of apps compared to the Google play store.  My advice is to buy a cheap Android tablet that you can install the apps you want on instead
I loved my first generation Kindle Fire and bought this one when my first one stopped charging. I was unaware of the ads that come on the device and did not like paying extra at a later point to have them removed. I would have preferred to have the option during the initial purchase. Overall this generation Kindle is okay. I wish my old one still worked though. I adored it and this one just isn't living up to the others standards yet. I'll keep using it and update this if my feelings change at a later point.
I love it!  This is so much faster than my phone and much easier to read.  Should have done this before.
I ordered on &#34;Prime Day&#34; and it was delivered a week later.... and I live in Seattle!  Graphics are good.  Heavier than I expected.  Was disappointed that some Apps were not available on the App Store or did not have great mobile interface.  Certainly a better price than an iPad for reading books but Apple still seems to have the best selection and integration of apps.
Is fine.
"This device allows me to leave my laptop at home when I travel, saving space and added weight in my carry-on bag.  I like the way it allows me to link various account and stay connected while I'm away from home.  I also love the color."
Big improvement over the earlier version. It's lighter and faster.  Battery life is OK. I still hate the carousel feature but at least now you can just have your app favorites stay up instead. I lucked out and bought it when it was $80. At that price it was definitely worth it.
Very nice.
"This new 4th Gen is amazing. There are a few things that I don't care fir such as back light being too bright and the time is too small but other than than, it has some improvements that are great. I use both of my Kindles. When one is out of gas, I just recharge and read the other one. I do have to listen to it now as my eyes are bothered by the screen. It gives me intense eye pain. That is why I love the text- to -speech. I listen now only but can buy all the great books I want to read and continue to enjoy my new Fire 7 HD. Thanks Amazon!"
"I wish I had my old malfunctioning Kindle back!  This is one of the worst &#34;upgrades&#34; ever.  You get to use the internet for a whopping ten minutes before you get the, message that the internet isn't working or the website is down.  I reset factory settings, twice....same thing ten minutes of internet use and you have to shut down and restart.  Sent the first one back, they replaced it and the new one does the same thing.<br />New router, New modem, New wifi printer...this thing can't find any for long.<br />Total junk, don't waste your time or money."
"I love everything about it, except for the color.  Although it's not a bad color, not my favorite.  The rest is great."
It intermittently turns itself off without warning. How do I return it?
The Kindle Fire was everything we hoped.
"awesome, and I love it."
I love it.
Was disappointed with the battery life compared to my older kindle fire.In standby mode drains too quickly.
just what I wanted...works fine!
It really good
Son loves it....bought this for $79 and son is still ohing and aahing over it
Awesome product....just took a while to get here
"Perfect for my children, love all the parental control"
Love it! And got it for a great price!
I love my 4th generation. Not impressed with this one. I got this new one as a mother's day gift to myself and the only advantages are that it's newer and has a warranty and it's faster. That's it. My problems with it:<br /><br />-i paid the same amount of money for less memory and can do without the additional camera if that's what is making up the difference. I'm not one of those people who uses their ipad as a camera. I have space efficient cameras and phones for that.<br />-the battery life is junk. My old kindle would last a few days on a charge coming and going. This one sits overnight and the next morning you have to charge it. It drains just sitting there doing nothing.<br />-sound issues: it makes an obnoxious noise in my headphones when connecting to things that play sound and for the longest time i was having problems with the volume fluctuating so drastically i could either barely hear or it was blowing out my ears. I was constantly having to adjust volume. Amazons answer: bluetooth headphones with microphones aren't compatible with the new kindle fire. That's all that exists. Turns out the pop of Facebook notifications was what was making the volume fluctuate.<br /><br />I'm just not impressed. It's not much of an improvement over what I've already got.
Not a bad little device. I like the parental controls for my child. Fairly easy to set up and use. Battery life is not so great.
not impressed.....liked my old kindle better.....gets hung up and freezes at times.......
Perks I didn't expect.  Gift for my son and he loves it.
My son loves it and finally leaves mine alone!
Best thing since sliced bread!
I liked it allot at first. After 7 months it stopped working. Now that is a big problem for me since I was very careful with it. We don't have money to drop on one of these every year so now I don't have a tablet and will not be getting one from amazon when the time comes.
"I'm not enjoying this as much as I believed I would.  I thought that since this was an Android device, I would be able to access FlashPlayer and be able to stream some online things that I like, as well as view an electronic magazine that I had subscribed to specifically because I got this device.  No Flash, so why did I waste $20 on the magazine subscription?  I'm trying to log in through my service, and it won't verify my e-mail/password combo, although I can access the magazine through my MacBook.  WTF.  Not really happy with the slowness of the operating system when it comes to apps.  Also don't like that I can't download Instagram.  The quality of video is not great on the screen either.  Really HATED the special offers, which was forcing me to watch commercials every time I unlocked the bloody screen.  Paid $15 more to get rid of that.  Just be honest, Amazon, and don't bother with the fricken' &#34;special offer&#34; price.  I also don't like that I can't seem to download a regular Google e-mail for my work e-mail, and so I'm forced to see ads while I'm trying to stay in touch with the office in my off hours.  Having said that, the Kindle function itself is fine most of the time.  Not sure if it's the device or Overdrive through my local library, but once I get halfway through a loaned eBook, I start having problems with missing the first page of a chapter.  What's up with that?  So now - all things considered.  If this thing takes a dive, I will simply save my money longer and buy an iPad, because this operating system is for the birds.  We've got two Mac desktop computers and two Mac laptops, as well as iPhones.  Believing that Flash would be included on this Android device was the only real selling point for me.  Because it's a good reader, it's not a total loss, so to sum up - meh.  And this was after reading and rereading reviews, and considering the purchase for months."
Love the Kindle Fire and bought this one for a relative that needed something to get on Facebook and read. Now they have so much more that they can do with it. Great product. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
I lose my place and can't retrieve.
I've had the Fire 7 HD for 8 months now and it's recently started to lock up. I would close an app and not be able to open anything else. I can scroll through my list of apps but clicking on them does nothing. A restart fixes it but everyday at some point it will lock up again. Really frustrating....<br /><br />Also disappointed there's no YouTube app...<br /><br />I had the original fire as well and that one had issues too. Thought I'd give the newer version a try but looks like it has its own issues. Think I'm done with the Fire.
"Love the Fire! I had one of the first generation Kindle's and now having wi-fi, awesome!"
It works very well and I haven't had any issues only I wish you could change the wallpaper
"Pros: 1) nice looking screen 2) long battery life.<br /><br />Cons: 1) riddled with ads - it seems that showing you ads is way more important than letting you get to your apps and actually enjoying the tablet. 2) Buggy - at least once a day it locks up and I have to restart it probably because of the built in ads and the processing power they consume. 3) No Google Play store - I get it that amazon wants you to buy from them and only them, but not allowing access to Google play just takes away so many useful apps that the Kindle could be used for.<br /><br />Final opinion: I will be returning this and getting an ad-free, Google play enabled device."
So far this tablet preforms as I anticipated.
Battery life is small but great for the price
Like like
Love it......
Definitely Kid approved!!!!<br />I haven't even been able to play with my new toy yet!
I like that it is set up like the fire stick on my tv so I'm already familiar with it.
It's been great so far!
My wife loves it. Reached her original Fire
Love it!!!
I love my new kindle fire!
Good quality and shipped in time .
I am so happy with my new Fire HD 7. This is my third device in the tablet series and I am hooked. Can't do without it! The ease of use and excellent customer service is matchless! Thank you Amazon for such a reliable and awesome product!
great
Awesomeness
Love it!!  I just hope that the charging port lasts on this model and does not break as easily as the ports on my other models of Kindle.
"No issues, everything great"
Great device. Very user friendly. Tons of power and features. I would definitely recommend it.
"A good tablet, wish more apps were available for download for these tablets"
Love it!
Meets my needs.
Very satisfied with the way the fire works.
Excellent as a Kindle ebook reader and book ordering application but poor at most other things. I did not expect to buy a device that shows me advertisements BEFORE I log on. The browser is hard to use. The on-screen keyboard varies tremendously between applications. The configuration settings are undocumented on the device and I had to use Google to troubleshoot issues from other than the Amazon site.  I was annoyed that I had to go to my laptop to effectively manage content on the device. Accessories such as a case that shuts off the device when you close the cover should be included instead of being a separate purchase. Cannot run Office 365 despite being android based.
I need help setting it up.  Stuff in Fire HD 7 is useless for setting up.<br />I don't want to view a stupid movie video; I want to set up the Kindle<br />so that this legally blind can READ my books!
"I like Amazon.  I like having Amazon Prime.  I loved my first Kindle e-reader.  I really love my second Kindle e-reader.  But I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, HATE my Kindle Fire.  Thank GOD I bought it on sale, because if I had paid for price, I would be even angrier.  It has ha problems since day one.  I bought the thing to use Audible (which I love).  The Kindle Fire decided to stop downloading books.  I was on the phone with the help desk for over an hour, while the technician tried to figure out what the problem was.  And as a music player, it's a literal piece of s***.  It freezes, it won't play, it stops playing suddenly, it won't let you change songs.    Thought, with everything I like about Amazon service and the original Kindle, the Fire would be a good investment.  SO WRONG!!!!!"
Excellent
Don't like the cord
Love it!
"The Amazon Fire HD 7: pros: clear picture, good storage capacity. cons: a little heavy, pretty much all apps from the Amazon store, not the most user friendly device"
This is an Android (Google) device and it is lacking access to the Google Play Store. I was unaware of this at the time of purchase. I consider this device defective for this reason.
"I love my Kindle fire HD 7. My son purchased a kindle fire for me about 4-5 years ago and I was very pleased with it (someone stole it 😢). BUT, this one right here?!?! Is absolutely amazing!! I especially love that it has a camera. I am still learning all that this one can do, but, I am loving it and so glad I caught it on Prime day!! Keep up the great work Amazon!!!"
Great for what It is for.  Although could do without the camera because it is terrible. Could have used that space for something else perhaps. All in all a great product.
East to use... Looks great... Thanks
I have been wanting one of these for awhile. I purchased it on Amazon's Black Friday & it was an awesome deal! The Kindle works great...above my expectations! :)
I am not great with current technology and am learning as I go.
"Just a heads up an maybe will help someone else.  I had some problems with my new Kindle Fire.  I had the original with no problems and that Kindle still works.  It turns out the reason some apps were not working on the Kindle HD 7 was that I needed to run an Kindle update immediately out of the box.  My guess is most of you might need to do that or maybe you were smarter than I was and did that right away, but I had to call Kindle support.  The system update solved my problems and the tech figured it out.  For instance, Netflix was not working until we did the update."
"I had a regular Kindle which I received as a gift.  I liked the possibility of having so much reading material accessible to me.  I bought a Kindle Fire and I love been able to read anywhere and then have internet access, music, games and so much more."
Just what I had expected and hoped for!  Very happy with it
"3.5 stars.  Iwent from a 1st gen kindle fire to this, considering its new over had quite a few lock ups and slow downs when trying to just start a program or load something.  My first gen kindle did this a bit towards the end of its life not when it was new.  Other than that it's just another kindle does every thing my old one did with a few extras that I almost never use.  To sum it up its doing what I expect but shouldn't get slow or freeze being new so it loses one and a half stars"
"Love this, nice to have something larger than the phone but smaller than the laptops"
I like it
Gift for my husband and he loves it
"Loving my Fire!!!!!!<br />My HD 7&#34; runs so much faster than my older one. Loving the camera, takes great pics. Also love the Magenta color, sooo pretty."
It is great
Even better design that my old one. Love it
Way exceeded my expectations.  It's a great kendel book reader and a great tablet. I like the apps but i really like the book reader. I also have a kendel but i like the fire better.
For the price and easy portability it can't be beat. Very satisfied with ease of programming and use.Would recommend to anyone interested in a device of this type.
It has a glare when using outside:(
I am very happy with the product. I had an earlier Fire but couldn't resist the price.
Love it
I am rather disappointed.  It takes a very long time to charge and does not  hold a charge for very long.
This is my third Kindle and I have to say disappointed . The scene blacks out it freezes I love reading I loved my Kindle but I am upset that this one is not like the last two
The best ever best Apple Windows anything out there. If your looking for a tablet stop right here and buy a kindle no need to look any were else
"Love it! This Fire is an awesome upgrade from my original Kindle. The keyboard works better, column controls on the side of the Kindle and lots more battery life."
"Love it so far, I am learning the ends and outs of using it."
"Had a kindle keyboard for years and loved it, except for needing a separate light and only black & white...then I was gifted with a new Fire,don't need a light, pictures are in color, Movies, Music...fabulous! Now I can have the new Crossley ID Guide to study on the plane and my trusty Kaufman field guide in the backpack.(every ounce counts when packing!) Kindle Fire rocks! The only thing that my kindle keyboard did better was battery life, but it also was more of a &#34;one trick pony&#34;, so that is really not a very fair comparison..."
I love to read whether it is an actual book or my new Kindle Fire.  The Kindle Fire just gives me another source for reading.  I love the ability to be able to have multiple books at my disposal at one time.  Also to have access to the books I purchased on my phone as well is awesome.
"I use to have a Acer Inconia a210. 10.1&#34; and after two years it doesn't work. It was just an ok tablet, but the 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD is excellent!<br /><br />I thought I wouldn't like the size of the tablet because I came from the Acer 10.1&#34; but I quickly adapted to the 7&#34; Fire. The picture quality is beyond amazing and what also is Amazing is the sound. The quality is perfect. When I had the Acer I had to get a Bluetooth speaker. My sister has the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 and the sound quality is so very low and also needs a additional speaker. The Kindle Fire 7 HD is complete.<br /><br />I mainly use it for watching movies but you can add Facebook, Twitter, etc<br /><br />I would recommend getting a case with it so you can protect it. It is certainly a high quality piece of electronics"
Love it.
"I love it!  The Fire HD does all that I expect of it. I needed an additional e-reader, but the Fire is more like a tablet.<br />I would buy it again."
Does what its supposed to do and would definitely recommend it.
I do not like the on off button.  It is a good thing that I have nails.
Buy it if you want to use it for reading. Not good as a tablet. Surfing the internet with this device is most frustrating. It crashes all the time. Totalling useless. Buy the basic kindle e reader instead.
"I don't see why the Kindle Fire 7 can't have a no-glare screen and the ability to be read outside.  I like to read in the yard, at the dog park, etc, but it's really difficult and even worse if I'm wearing sunglasses. No page numbers in the books, either.  Why not?  It also freezes once in a while or doesn't open to my present page.  I'm kind of disappointed in this newer model."
Works perfect for my needs!
"Not good If you like to read books. me, I love to sit in bed and read on my kindle in face I never set up mail chat fb or any thing that will announce a distraction, that what my I pad is for. I got a fire he in 2012 while that one is slightly bigger and just a hair higher in weight the beveled edges make a great way to hold the device while reading. This new one was 100.00 for prime day so I got one. I was planning on giving the old one to my daughter for her movies and I keep the new one. Well it's bulky and thick there is no bevel its likely a strain holding it while reading. It bugs me why they couldn't keep the same casing for the device, it's like they crammed the technology thicker rather than a couple of mm longer. Now I have no problems with the 2012 version. Isn't newer supposed to be better? I can't believe Amazon designers for the fire HD 2014 7 inch version would miss such a detail. Maybe it's something I'll become accustomed to and yes books are thicker but they bend and conform to hands. Anyone else a reader here. What do you think about the thickness. My I pad isn't this thick. I don't want a hand strap I already found a nice over I like. Sometimes I profit on a pillow but I'll shift positions and still like to hold the kindle to read. I could do so for hours with the other version. I haven't read a lot yet with this thick behemoth so the verdict isn't out yet totally if it's a bust, but surely others like the older models version of the casing shape. Keep in mind the cases for both are same thickness it's the edgi g that makes it less easy to ergonomically hold you need more thumb pressure to counter the thicker non beveled device where the older version counterbalance nicely between the fingers. Even nicer with the case on but I took the comparison photos with naked kindles for side by side look"
Still evaluating this unit. So far all is good. Time will tell.
"Holy cow, ads for every product under the sun now available on your Kindle. Vitamins, software, books, insurance, semen storage tanks, I've seen an ad for everything in just the past 3 hours I've owned this thing."
"It seems to hang up and I have to turn off and restart it, other than that I like it a lot."
Perfect for my six year I love that I could set this up with parental controls specially for me . My daughter purchased two movies so now I blocked all the extra not needing access to my six years old lol. Thank you Amazon for thinking about every parent.
"Great product for the price. I'm very happy with it. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the fact that while watching movies on Amazon Prime, there is no mirror option. Other that love it."
"Haven't had mine for even a week yet but so far,I think it is great!"
Love it!!! The screen is crystal clear. Easy set up! Lots of Apps. Very happy with my purchase.
it is great..... nice clear screen and loads fast..
"way beyind my expectations!  especially for the cost!  Love it. Amazed at its functionality.  even listened to music while preparing dinner, and watched a tv series in bed!  thank you, amazon!"
"I found that navigating on my previous Kindle Fire 7&#34;  much easier than I am finding on this new Kindle Fire HD 7.  I don't like seeing all the ads when I turn it on. I also like how I swipe my finger across the screen on my older Kindle to turn it on and how easier it is to tap it to navigate to hit 'home'.  The new Kindle Fire HD 7 is nice but I guess I am just use to my other Kindle Fire.  I only bought this because of Amazon Prime day recently and it was a good reduction in price ($79) to be able to upgrade to a newer version.  Otherwise I would not have bothered to purchased it,"
I love my new Kindle Fire HD!  I had an older Kindle Fire but the camera was awful in that you could not adjust for rear face or front face.  It was so difficult to get pictures!  Plus I was amazed at the clarity on the new Kindle's screen...HD definitely makes a difference.  I've only been using it less than a week but I am in love!  :)
This is my 3 fire love them all
Best bang for the buck.  It also has great parental controls!
"It should be easier to completely exit out of Apps than having to do them one at a time.  You should be able to swipe them out of the carousel.  Also, you need to fix the twitter app, the top tweet on the feed is always only half on the screen."
I just love it
"I didn't think I needed a tablet, but when my old kindle died...I decided to go for it. GREAT CHOICE!"
"It may look like an Android tablet, and for the most part behaves like one, but it is not.<br />The apps available in the Amazon app store are pretty much all available, but not the Google play store. (At first look at least.)<br />Now, since I got that it of the way, here is the good parts.<br />This device is designed for integration with Amazon. Shopping, music, movies, all are well done with this device. The sound is phenomenal for such small speakers. The video quality is beautiful. Battery life? I watched 3 episodes of firefly and only used 40% of the battery. Apparently you may download videos for offline viewing, but I haven't tried it yet."
My grandchildren already got this Fire at Xmas and I was so impressed with the performance I was determined to get one as well.  I was able to pick it up at an incredible price on Amazon Day and Ive been so happy ever since.  Fantastic for movie viewing.  Thanks Amazon.
"OK, I am a techy. This was for the kids. There are much better tablets in this price range!! The biggest problem is the lack of memory available on the 8 GB, so if you like this get the 16 GB. The interface is poor by modern standards. I would only recommend this to people who stream Amazon services only.  It is very heavy also compared to it's size. Within 2 days, I had to delete stuff from my daughters, just to allow an internet connection."
"I really dislike having to sign in every time.  I don't know why that is necessary, especially since I never had to do it before.<br />Since I got my second kindle I am so confused about my books.  I had ordered new ones and the others showed how much I had read, now they are piled together and most of them are not showing the amount I have read.<br />I have suddenly lost interest in the games and also reading.<br />The main idea I wanted the kindle was to get back to reading books; it is not as enjoyable now and I hope to get that feeling back."
Great. Just as expected.
"It's great, it has everything I need for school and then some."
"Yep, I love my fire. I use it all the time. It's the best!"
Love it!
"Wish I had gotten a samsung tablet this time, the silk browser and downloading times are RIDICULOUSLY slow."
I am very happy with this product.  Convenient and easy to use
"I really think there should have been a booklet enclosed explaining all of the functions of the kindle. As a senior citizen I believe that is very important for the maufacturers to understand that not everyone is familiar with computer language and instructions should be in plain English. .i am sure the device works fine,if I only could understand it."
"Amazon App Store was lacking, so I returned the product."
"The Kindle Fire is ... eh.  Because I got it at half price on the otherwise not-so-great &#34;black friday in July&#34; day, it's okay.  I would be pretty bummed if I bought this at full price. Basically I have a list of complaints!  It loses charge VERY quickly, and I'm only on it when I take a break (so 10 minutes at a time).  The power cord has already quit working, I have only had this two weeks. There is nothing on the outside of the cord to indicate that it was damaged at home in any way. Because Amazon and Google do not play well together, you cannot get the Google PlayStore on the Fire unless you look up how to hack it on youtube (which will apparently void any warranty).  I have to force stop/ restart several apps that come from the Amazon appstore, I don't know if this is the Fire or the apps themselves.  It does not pick up my wifi on my deck, where every other android device we own has a strong signal, so that's definitely the Fire.<br />To put this in perspective, I bought this at half price for ~$80.  Because I didn't trust my kids to handle an expensive tablet, I bought them some waaay off-brand tablets at Big Lots for $20 each.  Their tablets can do everything the Kindle Fire can do, and then some.  They're also several years old at this point, hold a charge, pick up wifi, and have BOTH the Amazon appstore and Google Play.  I think I got suckered in by branding...."
good product
"I love my new Kindle Fire HD 7! I had the very first Fire before and I did like it, but it was just really slow and hard to type on. This one handles typing much better and organizes everything nicely. The only issue I have is that the battery doesn't really last much at all. Not a big fan of that :("
What a joy...this little compact computer is a real joy! Thanks Amazon :)
I love it...
I really love this this Kindle. Easy to use and does much more than reading books.
Great Product - Love It.
Love my new Fire!  Quick to set up.  Easy to use.  All of my info easily transferred from first gen to this one.  Thanks!
"The smaller Kindle is very nice and easy to pack to and from work.  It's a little frustrating when you are using the video and want to go to the next video as it takes me several times touching the screen with my finger before the page moves.  Using the instant video with Prime it's not letting me start when I stopped, I have to manually find the next episode of a mini series or season.  It doesn't show my email buttons very well, they appear to be just below the bottom of the screen.<br />I'm keeping this as I do like it for what I'm using it for but will not buy another.  I do have the largest Kindle Fire and love it but it stays at home for the family."
I ordered the Kindle HD 7 and I hate it!! It freezes constantly so I have to power it down and then back on just to get out of a book or anything. Today I downloaded a new book and it did download but the book will not open at all! I don't see how anyone likes this thing! I'm just sticking with my iPad.
Love it!
"I got this my first generation Kindle Fire, which still works but will not charge. I had to wait a full month from the time I ordered it until it was delivered. All the colors were out of stock. Really? Such a popular product is not in stock? And I ordered mine reight before the hyped &#34;Prime Day,&#34; so I wonder how many tried to order and also had to wait.<br /><br />Features that I like:<br />The &#34;top mount&#34; power cable<br />The cleaner look of the screen<br />The resolution--very sharp and clear<br />E-mail much easier to read<br />Internet navigation is much better and easier<br />The selection of different progress indicators while reading an e-book--time, relative place, or even &#34;page xx of xxx&#34;<br />Firefly, even thought I don't think I'll use if much--it's just fun to play with<br /><br />Features that I dislike:<br />The power cable is too short to use easily--got to be in a low seat right next to an outlet to connect while using the Fire<br />The incessant ads and &#34;suggestions, until I finally found out how to hide them<br />The really poor help guides--very little information; mostly it's trial and error to learn the new-to-me features<br /><br />I have not used the camera yet. Again, info in &#34;Help&#34; is severely lacking and I have not yet gotten around to the trial and error with that feature.<br /><br />So, because of the long wait and a few negative issues, I only rated it as 4 stars rather than five."
Love it
Love it! I never thought I would actually like reading on one of these as I love to be able to hold the book in my hands and turn the actual page HOWEVER this is pretty great!
nice!
Easiest tablet we have ever used.
"My employers bought a kindle fire 7hd two weeks ago for me hoping to get one with front and rear camera but instead i got only the front,what should i do. I really love it and I'm so grateful to them can it be sorted out.please contact me via email"
I purchased this for my wife to replace her 1st generation Kindle Fire. She loves the extra speed and reliability.
Bought this at a great price. Very nice tablet for the price that I paid.
"Love, Love, Love!  The screen seems much brighter than the kindle I had before.  So, many more options and a lot faster."
"I got my mom and HP 8&#34; tablet because the Fire HD 7&#34; was out of stock and we needed it in time for her birthday on July 1st.  Then, there was a day when the Fire HD 7&#34; tablet was on a bit of a special, so I ordered the Fire for him.  It arrived yesterday and other than a little trouble getting the right Amazon account - between mine and my son's - on the account for that Fire - he had a ball with it.  Well, he and his Grandma got together with their respective Fire and HP tablets and have decided that the heavier, bigger 8&#34; HP is better for my son, and the Fire HD 7&#34; tablet is better for his Grandma who has arthritic thumbs, because it's lighter and slimmer so it's easier for her to maneuver.  So they will be switching after Sunday dinner this weekend.  So kudos to the great Fire for Grandma and the great HP for her grandson (my son)."
&#34;Luved it&#34; Everything I expected and more&#34;
Was happy with older kindle fire until connection inside made charging difficult.  This has still more great features.
"I am learning what it has to offer, but so far it is great."
love it
Very  pleased  with my  purchase
"I really want to like this tablet.  It's cute, light, the color is great, I even prefer the official amazon case to the official iPad case for my iPad 4. That being said.....this tablet is utter garbage.  The UI doesn't bother me, I can configure it the way I want with &#34;collections&#34; and the like.  The screen is bright and of good quality, and the Dolby speakers really do sound great, better than my iPad.  However, the compliments end here.<br /><br />What grinds my gears about this tablet:<br /><br />- Buggy as hell.  From apps not updating or loading properly to magazines loading and then disappearing, this OS is FULL of bugs that &#34;updates&#34; do not seem to solve.  I have had to delete, de-register, and restore this tablet FOUR TIMES since purchasing it last November, and Amazon has had to send me a replacement because the original device would not allow me to add my Gmail no matter what I tried.<br />- Instant Video:  For the past month I get a &#34;license error&#34; every time I try to play an instant video, and I am a prime member and have been since 2010.  Isn't the whole point behind this amazon tablet is so it can play amazon content?  I've given up trying to fix it and use Netflix instead, as the customer service is outsourced and completely inept.<br />- Lack of customization:  Not being able to add a background image to the home screen is a colossal error.<br />- Lack of Google Play Services:  Speaking of colossal mistakes, not including google play on this device is a HUGE mistake.  Whatever the reason is, get over it and include Google.  Not being able to have chrome, gmail, etc is just plain dumb and cripples an already crippled device.<br />- Lack of apps: another well discussed subject.  The major ones are here, but many are not, as discussed above.<br /><br />All in all very much a half baked device that could have been a lot better."
It is pretty much like the one I have except it is HD and it has a camera. So not new to me but it was a great buy. I do wish it had a button that lit up when it was charging like my old one though.
I absolutely love it !!!!
"A good tablet but at times, it freezes up. I've already had to reset it when the carousel disappeared and I could not get the appstore, list of apps, etc open from the top menu."
"I'm going to tell you right off the bat I own a Mac, iPhone, iPad mini, Samsung Tab Pro 10.1, and a Kindle Voyage along with this thing. My Kindle Voyage is my fourth kindle e-reader.<br /><br />I bought the kindle fire hd 7 when they had the sale going on. I wanted to try it. I'm glad it's not my only tablet device. I bought it because of the price and to keep in my desk at work so I could read on my lunch or do other things. I wasn't expecting much but thought that since the e-readers I have bought are by far to any other e-reader I've tried I thought I might be missing something with the fire. I'm not.<br /><br />My pros for this are:<br />Cost, couldn't beat the price.<br /><br />Native Kindle books app, it works much better than the ones on iOS devices and android devices.<br /><br />Exterior size, fits in my hand nicely and tucks away nicely in my drawer.<br /><br />My cons are:<br /><br />Screen is smaller than I thought it would be. A lot of wasted space around the sides of the screen.<br /><br />Battery life is HORRIBLE. I've mostly read on it and the battery drains way too fast. It went from 100% charge to 55% charge after reading on it for two hours with the book settings to black background and white lettering. No video watching, no excessive browsing of websites or usage of apps. Just reading.<br /><br />Seems to have a little light bleed around the edges. Not much but it is there.<br /><br />Weight, it's much heavier than I thought it would be. It feels about as heavy as my Samsung tab pro 10.1.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't buy it, but be ready for some drawbacks. It may be just what you're looking for. For me it will just be a device I use at work to read on for some of my lunch break. Not my favorite device bu far but it should function for what I want it to."
Perfect size for a travel tablet. Can't seem to get my SLING TV app from android to download.
I cannot fathom how much.
"Being an ipad user I was skeptical about getting a kindle. I've never used any android type device so I was worried that it would be difficult to use. But it wasn't! The various screens and menus take a bit of time to get used to, but the learning curve isn't that difficult.<br /><br />The build of the kindle is quite sturdy. While it is made of plastic, it definitely feels more durable than an other tablets. I'm not afraid to take it outdoors. There are tons of apps available in the amazon app store as well - all the social networking apps and popular games are there. The performance is great, apps run well and the integration with my amazon account is great, especially as a prime member it is easy to access and download digital content.<br /><br />The reason the kindle loses a star: battery life and responsiveness. I've found that the kindle sometimes doesn't hold a charge for long periods of time when not in use. A minor detail, but worth noting. On some of the interfaces as well, there is a bit of lag time between when I touch and when the device responds. It is still fairly quick, but it is noticeable. This isn't always a problem though.<br /><br />Overall, especially for the price, I think the Kindle Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level tablet!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"The Fire HD7 is easy to use.  It is the same quality as my other kindle products. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for more than an e-reader.  I especially like the ability to move around in the Fire, it is not complicated or difficult.  The Fire enables me to read and stay connect to my world."
Very readable
Great machine<br />Had original fire- big difference - picture speed
"I like my HD7,  does all I expect of it."
"Good value, right size and performs adequately.  All things considered; if I had it to do again, I would not have purchased the iPad 3 mini as the Apple pad is not worth the extra cost."
Much faster and easier to use than my iPad.  Needless to say--it was cheaper too.
"Compact, easy to use, and powerful.<br />Holds charge very well."
It's very good product with its price range. But I only this so far it need to be fixed is...when some videos are played in YouTube and rotate to horizontal..<br />Video jumps all the edges..I hate that..<br /><br />Rest all are perfect..hope we get some OS update to fix this.
Much better than my last kindle!!!
"With this new Kindle, the sound is incredibly better.  The screen for watching videos is crisper and there is faster processing for streaming so less pixelation.  I like that there is a synopses of each book attached to the ebook.  However, I owned a previous iteration of the Kindle Fire and I actually liked it better.  It was less sensitive to screen rotation.  This version freaks out quickly and cant decided which rotation to use if you are laying down reading.  The older version would go to sleep and easily waken when you touched the screen.  This version goes blank and wont waken.  It either requires a reboot or closing and opening the book cover to bring up the wake screen.  The back arrow doesnt always go back - it sometimes seems to catch and freeze.  The remove from carousel or device in this version requires an additional step which I found annoying after never having two steps in the previous version.  The advertisements are incredibly annoying to have to swipe off.  There isnt an option to turn them off but as a PRIME customer I feel this is complete overkill.  Usually the advertisements are not for products Im interested in and will not be purchasing.  Im in my Amazon account weekly so if I must receive advertisements, wouldnt it make sense to target what I purchase? Overall I got what I expected with these few glitches that I hope eventually work themselves out."
"I Love Love Love this Kindle Fire!!! It is so much more than I expected!!! I love the camera, the crystal clear screen, everything about it!!! I have the Kindle Fire 7&#34; that was the last model before the first generation of the HD model came out and I love that Kindle too!! I am giving it to my little grandchildren so they can play their games on it and my daughter can read the books that I have on it!!! I can't rate this new one high enough, if it had 100 stars available I would give it just that!!!!! Love it!!!!!"
"This Kindle has everything I need. The front and rear camera is really nice. I can check my mail along with so many other things, Now I don't have to take two or more items that I can do with one. Reading books is my major reason for the kindle it's more light weight then my last one. This was a gift and I couldn't have received a better Birthday present."
"I was really excited to get this tablet, because my first one didn't have a camera.  But this one freezes up all the time, and I haven't downloaded anything on it.  Haven't seen anything posted that would help it either.  And needless to say,haven't used either camera on it.  I'm disappointed."
HD display is great for a 7&#34; device.  Still working on synching this with other things but a very nice product for the price.
Gift from my husband and I'm really enjoying it.
"I would like to buy the extended warranty for this product, please."
It nice. Wish my amazon account want not linked to tablet.
love the fire! my 2 year old loves the fire! my mother loves the fire! my brother loves the fire! wish I had bought this brand the first time around!!!!
"I was disappointed to find out that I could not access google play store, so I couldn't get the nook app on this device like I have the Kindle app on my Nook. I was hoping to be able to just have one device as my Nook is starting to get a bit slow. My fault for not doing enough research. The device works well,it just doesn't allow me the convenience I had hoped it would."
i think a heads up on it not being flash compatible was in order.<br />otherwise it does all it is supposed to.
Great - did however arrive with a smudge that can't be cleaned on the back.
easy to use- fast shipping- fast internet-love it!!!
"For the sale price of $99 this is an OK tablet,  As an owner of an Ipad also, I can tell you there is no comparison.  Spend the extra money and get the Ipad."
I read all my magazines on this Fire. The color is great. Worth every dollar.
Love it
"Suddenly, utterly and completely died after just under six months; it was great until then.  I guess if you think of it as a &#34;disposable&#34; product and buy a new one twice a year, it would be fine."
Outstanding clarity and graphics
Still on the learning curve with using this.  So far the set up has been easy.  Didn't give it a 5 star rating because it irks me that I have to download instructions etc instead of including them in the box.
I was soooo excited to get my tablet... just to be soo disappointed..... like most new things it wasn't completely charged when i first got it.. n i was like ok. just drain it out n then charge.. was my thinking.... that was at around 1 o'clock it is now 530 n my battery has only charged to 30%... the tablet was off while charging. and i did use the cable they gave me.. but seriously 30 freaking percent for 4 hrs of charging!!!! so i unplugged it n wanted to see if maybe the battery didn't die as fast... yea right within 5 mins of having it off the charge it had dropped 8% of its charge.... n that that i wasn't doing anything heavy n had the screen at the lowest in brightness... i think i might just have to return this :(
"my old fire was going out, and a friend was glad I passed it to her. I was glad to get this. It seems more defined...and love the color. Love to keep it with me to do stuff on trips so I don't need my laptop!"
"Dandy ereader with some tablet capabilities. Well built, has already taken a fall or two. Good packaging. Giftee very pleased."
This tablet so difficult to use and no instructions included so I am returning it!!
Still very new but what I don't like is the lack of apps that I'm used to having on my iPhone that are not available in the Amazon App Store.  Even simple apps like Home Depot and Lowes are not in the app store.  Battery life seems to be good and the resolution is excellent.
"Great value compared to the &#34;luxury&#34; tablets out there. I love everything about it but seeing as how I'm not tech savvy, I could see how it might be limiting in some ways to others"
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this tablet.
"The glass on my original kindle shattered.  I was sad, and so with a heavy heart I bought the new kindle fire, and it is even better than the old one, Everything from the old kindle was transferred to my new Kindle.  I am happy once again.  Thank you."
Great for my travel needs!
Love this! Fits in my purse so perfect- if I were to. Up it over again I would do more investigating.  I. Would encourage everyone to buy this .<br />I have an iPad 3 and an iPhone 4s nes would easily give my phone up but never my iPad or my kindle fire. I love the tablets!
I love it!
It works perfectly and does exactly what is advertised.
Great tablet! Very functional!
I like it a lot.
"Not being able to use anything from google play store is annoying. Can't play any music I send to myself via email on this tablet. Can't seem to add any music from my android devices. OMG the cameras totally suck! There's no way that's HD quality pictures. Throw away cameras from early 90s take higher definition pictures. WOW THIS THING IS A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT!!! Oh and shipping took over 3 weeks. Theres no way to add music to Amazon cloud that is stored on another tablet.  For example I have a Samsung  Galaxy Note tablet with alot of wma music,  and there's no way to send it to the cloud so that I'd be able to listen to it on this Fire tablet. Can only send music to cloud from a cpu or Mac. I wouldn't ever buy this again.  Amazon app store also sucks. Barely any good apps."
Love my new Kindle Fire HD 7
I have had this since Feburary of this year and now it doesn't connect to internet.
nice
"Nice size, great picture, pretty fast, easy to set up and use, and lots of aps to make it pretty darn functional. I didn't give it a '5' solely because it didn't meet my expectations. I must admit with the benefit of hindsight, that my expectations were too high. Expecting a full featured tablet was not reasonable. I am happy with it and hope to use it for a long time."
Its ok works well prefer my iPad but you can't beat the price
Love it!
kindle arrived right on time set up.  Black Friday is great!
Still very functional. Has great graphics. A good chunk of the memory is taken up by the OS. Has the ability to create multiple profiles but each profile sucks up a lot of memory.
AWESOME
very nice ! great speed and color I wish it had a larger screen for people with problems with their eyesight.
"Suits my needs to a T. Love the size ,my books on it are great too."
"As always, great product. This is our 3rd one in our home right now.❤️"
"The kindle works great, only reason I am rating it a 4 is that the description doesn't clearly say what generation it is.  That makes it more difficult than it should be to select the correct case for it."
"It's ok, my larger one is much easier to read, but it must have gotten a virus, and no longer works"
Excellent product. It works very fast. The screen is very big.
Awesome
"I love my Fire HD7 I have been busy downloading books, apps and more...The camera seems like it is pretty good.<br />I am looking forward to learning to use everything on it."
Excellent product. It has more capabilities than I imagined.
"- You have to pay $15 extra to take off annoying ads. - You don't have the option to change the wallpaper or costumize the display. If someone had told me this, I would have not bought this piece of sh*t! ... I only bought it because I tought I was getting a good deal because of #primeday I own the fire phone and I love it but this is just crap..."
Love it
Very good kindle my son had 3 different tablets before and this is the best one he has ever had.
I'm enjoying my gift. Learning how to use my fire HD7
Nice unit all good disappointed it won't work for chrome cast
I bought this as a present for my wife.  She was using her cell phone to try to keep up with face book and other things.  She was looking at new phones(larger and easier to read) but this worked perfect for her while she is at home using the wi-fi. Plus she likes it better than her original Kindle for reading in the car or where ever.
"I have to admit that I'm pleasantly surprised.  By way of context, I have numerous Kindles of many flavors, including 2 Fires (2nd gen HD), and the original Fire.  I had the HDX in the house, and returned it.  I waited to purchase this one, since I didn't really 'need' it.  This is a beautiful device.  As far as features:  Sound:  I was concerned about speaker placement when I saw that they were at the bottom (when in Amazon's case).  I was hoping for higher volume and better sound than on my previous Fires, and this device delivers both.  The volume is high enough that it doesn't need external speakers (which I typically use when using my older devices).  Placed in the Amazon stand up case, even though the speakers are at the bottom, the sound is great.  Reading:  Great screen.  I was worried about the 'purple haze' that appeared around the screen edge of the HDX (the reason for my return).  There is none. This is also a great reader if you prefer a backlit screen.  Speed:  The difference in speed is noticeable.  Everything seems to happen faster:  from navigating the carousel, switching or loading apps, accessing on line sites, etc.  It's great.  Functionality: There is also added functionality which is helpful when using the device.  This may be added to older devices via a software update, but to date I haven't seen them.  (Think of the functionality as 'assists' when on different screens which are nice to have).  Movies:  I haven't watched any video yet, but will do so, and update this review in a few days.  Memory:  Buy the 16G.  There is preloaded system/app stuff that takes up some of your space (although from first glance, it appears like there is less pre-used space than on my older devices).  I purchased my original Fire with 8G, and ran out very quickly.  The 16G is worth the extra money.  Also, if you are a Prime member, take advantage of your Prime offerings which take up space if loaded onto your device.  It will save you space.  The standup case:  Isfine.  I love my Origami cases for my old Fires, and was sorry that this one was not an Origami case, but it's fine.  It stands straight in both portrait and landscape mode.  Amazing specs for the price!  The device has been going on sale regularly, so if you watch it, you should be able to catch it at a reduced price.  (A tip:  If you put it in your cart, save it for later, then check your cart daily, it will show any discounts on items which you've 'saved for later'.)  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it!  Enjoy!"
"Great picture, tends to freeze up at times . Some apps I wouldn't have picked like Wall Street Journal come pre loaded for some reason. ? Don't like the commercial that appears every time I log in?!"
Love it!
"Super cheap tablet, nice screen, bright colors, fine sound, actually quite good as a movie player for my son during long flights.<br /><br />However, as a fully functional tablet, for enjoying some internet reading, for even logically organizing downloaded children's youtube shows the Kindle Fire is pretty amazingly horrible.<br /><br />The tablet runs a modified version of android, which results in not having access to the Google app store (although, apparently you can install apps directly). The pre-installed apps on my kindle fire were not ideal for organizing downloaded, unpurchased video content, but you can find some acceptable free ones from the amazon app store.<br /><br />The user interface is clunky, unintuitive, and difficult to use (although, to be forthright, I've been inculcated on iOS and this is my first foray into a semi android world). The web browser seems to struggle with most web pages, sometimes failing to load media content, or other times lagging due to constant insistance on reloading pages.<br /><br />I think for the price it's well worth it for me, I simply wanted a large screen movie player, but I don't enjoy using it for anything else."
"As expected, a great product."
Had an older model that my daughter essentially took ownership of so I upgraded!  Great value for the money. Only thing that disappoints me is the older model I have has the hdmi output and this one does not.
Very good value for money !
"The Kindle Fire tablets should be considered disposable items. I've purchased several as gifts and every one of them has ended up needing to be replaced. Luckily most of them died within the 1 year warranty period, and Amazon has a good return policy (possibly to compensate for the abysmal tech support). The last one to die is out of warranty, and Amazon's only solution was to offer me a supposedly &#34;very discounted rate&#34; on a replacement, which ended up being $25 off of the ludicrous prices on their refurbished and outdated outlet offerings. The best deal they offered me was still $30 more than I paid for the original kindle almost 2 years ago when it was new tech. Not one of the 6 or 7 different support techs I worked with could even point me to a site with troubleshooting options to re-install the factory software so that I could determine whether there is an actual hardware issue with this disposable tablet. They freely admitted that they don't even bother trying to repair these devices, and that replacement was my only option. No ability to replace a battery, no established way to re-install the factory default software, and a troubleshooting script taken from Dogbert - &#34;Shut up and reboot.&#34;  Very disappointed, Amazon."
Love it.
"This tablet is consumer friendly and capable of connecting easily to wifi for additional internet options including all Amazon features such as kindle books, movies, music and music.  Great deal!"
I absolutely love it!
"I take my tablet everywhere I go ty fire , perfect"
"I upgraded from the kindle fire. There are so many features available, I haven't even discovered all of them yet. My favorite feature is the ability to lock the auto-rotate. The camera takes nice photos, the sound is good quality. Haven't had any problems yet."
The original purchase included a defective charging cable. I went on line with Amazon.com and they sent me a replacement. It's all good now. Just as useful as the first kindle and half the size.
I have only had the Fire for a few days. I have only scratched the surface of what it can do but so far so good
I was so pleased to get this as a gift.  I wanted the lighted screen.  I had the older model kindle with the keyboard and liked it fine but did not like using a flashlight to read at night.  The charge on that old kindle lasted forever and I read a lot.  This new version barely lasts through a book and a half probably because of all the other stuff it has on it.  But I still love it and reading with the light is wonderful.  It is bright and does not hurt your eyes. Will not give up the old one though for times when charging is not available.
I like it a lot.  I do wish that the 'on' button was where it used to be on my older kindle--at the bottom and round.  I also liked the carousel display on the older  one. I haven't figured out how (if possible) to access things without having to unlock the screen on this one.
awesome great deal. I love it!!
"my second kindle. first one was a plain jane, i LOVE my fire. easy to navigate, plays music, games and books. there's more that i have not gotten into yet but i am highly satisfied with what i have used so far."
Very satisfied. Easy to use.
"Love it, a lot better than the old model..."
The Kindle Fire HD is my second and while my first is still in top condition I wanted a second to carry around &#34;just in case&#34; something happened to my first. The one thing I noted is there is no Micro HDMI out port on the new but that has been replaced by the ability to fling shows to the TV if you also have Kindle TV Fire. I like my Micro HDMI out port. The new one is noticeably faster and Kindle's speakers are so much better than iPad's which I bought and quickly returned and then ordered this! Can't go wrong here.
"So far, so good. I am not happy with the camera function having a 2 megapixel resolution. It makes crummy pictures. Aside from that, I am pleased."
"Reading is good, but having problems getting on WiFi and understanding programs"
I have 3 Kindles and have enjoyed all of them. I really like the Fire because it has more to enjoy on it. I give it all stars.
"I'm still learning, how to use it.<br />But I love it"
I love everything about my new Kindle....I can read at night without the lights on.  That is my favorite feature.
"I luv it, Great for my reading and portable."
"I love Amazon, and Kindle products, but the battery on this one just isn't up to the standard that I've experienced with other products. A friend has had a similar experience, with the battery lasting only 1-2 hours. Hate to do it, but this has to be 3 stars for me."
I was disappointed in myself that I didn't do enough research on storage size.  It works fine otherwise.
I had an early generation  Kindle fire and this one definitely has more features.  It starts much quicker. Gamen graphics appear a bit different  from my old kindle fire also. So far I am pleased with this purchase.
I am well pleased with my Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this.
Great product!
"At first this tablet was great, a month later it does nothing but freeze up. Got suckered into buying the anti-virus and  app cache clearing app.  Nope nothing has changed it still freezes up and is SLOW. Pay the extra money for an iPad , you pay for what u get."
Love it. Have not been disappointed with anything on it.
I like it a lot
"Excellent item, will buy again."
Love it! The only thing I could say to make it better is if it coincided with google play store. But Amazon store is growing on me.
"Having no experience with tablets other than a few uses of an iPad I was moderately pleased with the Fire HD 7. The image quality is very good and the size of the device is perfect for what I use it for, which is mainly viewing videos during flights, document reading and the occasional shopping or email. The processing is a bit slow and choppy sometimes, but for the Prime Day rate of $79.00, it was hard to pass up!"
This is my second Kindle. I hardly ever open up my laptop anymore because I can do everything I want on the Kindle. My only complaint about my new Kindle is that the charge cord is too short.
A great tablet for the money.  I use this everyday and the battery life is great!  Wish my I-phone had as good a battery.
perfect
"Really appreciated this purchase, worth it!"
Fantastic.  Came early.
Much lighter than my previous Fired HD. Screen clarity excellent.  And my favorite feature is printing to my fire from the internet!
Love the kindle.  Battery charge seems shorter  than it should be.  Have to recharge twice a day.  Have to turn off kindle if I want to get out of book I am reading.  Otherwise it is a great item.
All experiences were as advertised.
I love the ease of the tablet.  I hate that it is loaded to show me ads every time I open it.
"Not happy at all. Slow and force stops every 5 minutes. Not many apps available for my needs. The colors and clarity are good, it just does not suit my needs whatsoever. Useless."
My Hubby Loves his Kindle Fire HD!!
"This is an awesome little tablet for all your basic internet needs. I love having my favorite Amazon apps easily accessible. Facebook works great, email access, web browser, movies, music, and of course books! The brightness adjustments are really nice for when you are outdoors or browsing late at night. I can connect easily to any open Wi-Fi in public, so I take it with me almost everywhere. Definitely get a protective case, I've accidentally knocked it onto the floor a few times. Kid friendly! Mine are ages 2-10 and they can all use it easily. I love having multi-user capability with parental controls. I doubt you will be disappointed with this purchase."
It is wonderful. I prior had a Kindle Fire.  How long is the warranty? Thanks.
Had for a week got stuck in a restart loop. Disappointed in the device but amazon  is making it right with a brand new fire!!
It does not have an micro hdmi port and I cannot find a micro usb to hdmi adapter cord that will work with my ( 4th generation )Amazon HD 7.
Great little device!  I love it!
Great to watch movies and get email and surf web
"No screen lock for toddler and kids, I returned mine."
It has been easier to learn than I expected and it has been wonderful to  be unchanged from the computer.
The UI is terrible and prevents even the most basic attempts to customize it - such as resizing the ridiculous over-sized icons or getting rid of the horrible looking carousel on the home screen. I get that the low cost is supposed to be covered in part by the adverts but does Amazon really have to be so ham fisted about it? And there isn't any good reason for the complete lack of customization for the home screen - I was excepting Android not this half dead Frankenstein monster.<br /><br />A number of apps that you may find useless come preloaded and can not be removed cutting the '16GB' down significantly by the time you get it out of the box. Also batter power doesn't last as long as claimed closer to 5 hours than 8.<br /><br />I suppose a decent enough tablet if you have the tech know-how to root it and strip out the OS for a decent one but that is about it.
My wife got one recently and it was a no brainer when it went on sale. It is fast and convenient.
"Great while they last. We got 3 of these for my kids. After just over a year of light use, 2 of the 3 have failed. They won't turn on at all. After 2 hours with tech support, I was told I would have to buy new ones.<br /><br />Parents, spend a little extra, get an Ipad mini and a good protective case. It will last you years longer and the controls built into the ipads are actually better as you can permit kids to only go on certain websites.<br /><br />This is the first time I've been seriously disappointed with Amazon."
Love it.
Love it! Play around all the time on it!
My mom loved her Christmas gift
Needed interface. Can't install any Google play software that I already own and paid for without rooting the thing. The FreeTime app that comes installed makes it easy too easy for kids to fill up the small storage and then nothing works... For example WiFi keeps shutting off when storage is full.
"New unused? off/on button did not work. Did all the things, instructions, videos and user guide. Nothing worked. Called and talked to nice person. Sent it back for a replacement.  Instead of sending me a brand new Kindle I received a refurbished one.  This one worked, but didn't have charger plug with it.  Found out I would have to pay extra for that. Was not  a happy camper."
wonderful !! Love it !!!
Everything I wanted and more. Extremely happy with it.
the sound went out on my Kindle for no reason.  no response of a fix from Amazon.  This is my second Kindle so I am rather disappointed
"My Kindle Fire HD, 7&#34; is wonderful. Screen clarity and color are amazing. This was a gift from my husband. What a great gift it is too."
This product met and excepted my expectations I can't say enough good things about this!
Screen died on last Kindle Fire after a year or two of use.  Purchased a new one and it already had problems from the first.
Great gifts. We are a 4 kindle household and love them.
Clearer and has camera...love it!!!!!
"I was unaware how my current tablet was NOT meeting my needs until getting my new Fire. HOWEVER, since my last tablet was an Android, I assumed I would be able to add similar apps such as Nook to the Fire. WRONG! So now, I have Nook books on a dying tablet and no way to read them on my new Fire tablet. Hey, Amazon, get with the program and add the Nook app. It's not like you haven't made buying from Amazon as easy as one click or something! It is for sure that most of my books are Kindle edition and not Nook, but now I must rush to read my Nook books or go out and buy a Nook reader!!!!!"
The best tablet in the size and price range you'll find out there in the market.
Awesome deal
Really enjoy this Kindle--good size--easy set-up (even for technically challenged as me)--light weight--quick charge. Definitely recommend.
Love it! Got it for a great price which ma it mokes  makes me love itore!
Love to playGames and search for items.
So far I love it.
this new Kindle belongs to me --- Annette DiPsolo.  I bought it on my visa using my name...why do you have it registered to my husband...??? I gave him the older one.
"I bought it for my nine-year-old and so far so good! He accidentally drops it everywhere and luckily no damage as of yet.   My son uses the timer function when he reads, which is a great motivator in itself. This gadget has been getting him to read much more and he has also had the opportunity to explore audiobooks with the tablet.   I like the color personalization option – I like for my son to have a sense of individualism with his things.  One thing I don't like about the Kindle Fire is the constant advertisements as one types in their password, whether it is connected to WiFi or not."
Very disappointed with the product quality and features.. Frustrated.. Bought iPad instead..
Great price on Amazon Prime day!!!
This is my second kindle fire I had to buy another one after my son broke the first one I missed it to much
"Great for use within the Amazon ecosystem but once you start venturing out you will inevitably be disappointed. No Google apps support means that the few official apps that appear on Fire HD tablets often languish for long periods of time without updates, leaving Fire HD users wondering when, if ever, they will get the current experience. For Amazon apps it works fine but the lack of storage was more noticeable than I anticipated. 16GB or higher should be fine but 8GB is just way WAY too small. A fine, cheap tablet for Amazon but if you look at it as an Android tablet you will most likely be very disappointed."
"This was to replace the Kindle Fire that I lost. I am a little disappointed as this one is later generation, but not much better. I am getting used to it and learning to like it much better. I should have gotten a larger one, I would have been happier. The graphics are very good quality. Oh and the price was perfect! Actually I do love it."
Third Kindle. Can't say enough about them and the price was fantastic.
Just getting the hang of it. Never used one before. Having fun.
Great
Meets my needs. Fun
Great Product - Convenient size.
"Awesome tech toy with lots of apps, beautiful display, and extremely user friendly. Huge bang for the buck - well worth the money."
"I wanted the 16gb version but was sold out soon settled for the 8gb version.  But the user usable memory size is only about 4gb, limiting what app you can install, and negating the advantage of fire hd offline video viewing.  ( you can store about 10 episode of 30mins show in sd with 1gb)<br /><br />Came with freetime, Amazon parental control software.  Basic function of time limits of video/games/book is there, however adding contents for the children accounts is not straight forward and crumbersome.  Also annoyed by the upselling of freetime unlimited which costs extra."
"Great tablet, super fast.  However, not as indestructible as the advertising claims.  Screen popped out in 1 corner, but no problem popping it back in."
Granddaughter loves it.
Much lighter than old kindle 7. What I expected.  Easy set up.
Product just as anticipated.  Enjoying it.
"This is my 5th kindle, I have purchased them for the grandchildren and myself. Love the product."
I am just learning to play with this.
Like it but wish it had an USB port.
"After several years of using a basic Kindle, I was given a Fire HD 7. It's clarity, color and features are better than I expected!  It is easy to hold & can be rotated 360 degrees & the image stays upright!  It is a blast!"
Yes my husband loves it
battery does not last very long-very disappointed
Absolutely love it. More than meets my expectations
awesome.  I never had a kindle before and I am loving all the free apps and I can stick it in my purse for vacation.love the app white light healing. It is so relaxing and could never have got it without the kindle. I can sit in my chair and enjoy playing the games. I am getting organized too. I don't know how I got along without it. You can't carry around your computer. You can a tablet but my tablet did not have all the free apps .
Too much ads
It is heavier than my Nook which is also the 7&#34; HD. Setting up the function to check out books from the library was more complicated. The display has a lot of glare. The price was right. I like the camera function so that I can Skype.
Battery does not last long.
"This is one of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. I will say the first one I received had problems. It would restart it self and freeze up very easily. However, amazon customer service did everything that they could to fix my tablet, and when they couldn't do anything, they sent me a brand new tablet. Once I got the tablet that worked it was one of the best devices I ever bought. It works for reading, browsing the internet, listening to music, and other things that a tablet can do. It runs on android, and even though android does not have all the apps that IOS has, all the apps run very smoothly. I recommend the amazon kindle fire 7' hd to anyone looking for an inexpensive tablet that operates with and withoutt wi-fi use and for everyday use."
This thing is a piece of junk that freezes up every time I use it .it's very slow. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on it . Very disappointed.
Doesn't have a USB port
It's a solid feeling tablet. Does everything I would expect it to do.
"A nice little reader and so much more. I was pleasantly surprised by exactly how much I could do with my new Kindle Fire and I'm still learning things all the time. It was really easy to set up and get running. It recognized my network immediately (which is a first for any device!) and was completely plug-n-play. I do wish is that it had come with a longer USB cord and headphones. I'm just mentioning it so if you are buying this item you'll know that you may need to order a cord and earbuds at the same time. Definitely not a deal breaker!<br /><br />So why not a full five stars?<br /><br />If you are easily annoyed, you might want to skip the discount if you buy the Kindle with advertising on the lock screen. While it is true that the advertisements will only appear before you put in your pin, I really would have preferred a way to set my own backgrounds like EVERY OTHER DEVICE I OWN.<br /><br />Insult to injury? You will have to pay $15.00 extra dollars for the luxury of no ads. I received this as a gift and while I don't begrudge the gifter the discount they received when they made the purchase, Amazon could have warned them that this would happen -- making them pass this ADnoyance on to the person receiving their gift is just poor form!"
I replaced my son's Kindle Fire HD 7 with the fire HD 7 because they said they no longer make the Kindle fire HD7 but unfortunately it doesn't download some games especially asphalt 8 which is my son's favorite game. My son loves cars so much and this game was his favorite. Not being able to download it in his fire HD makes the device seems useless. I have contacted amazon and they said they want to modify the device so Asphalt 8 can be downloaded and then call me back but never heard from them for a long time now. I just wish they can do something about it
My son got this as a gift and he loves it.  Memory space is generous and he can also store stuff on his cloud account.
The screen freezes often.
"This is amazing, but the reason why i rate this 4 stars is because now it Kicks you out of the silk browser"
My son loves it... We just have to figure out how to use it lol
Disappointed unlike my previous model it does not except an HDM cable. Which is the reason I order it the Port on my old model is malfunctioning.
"I really enjoy the Kindle HD Fire, this is my third Kindle.  My Kindle HD Fire 7&#34; is wonderful, the only complaint I have is that there is no rear facing camera if it did in my opinion this would be the best reader on the market​."
I love it. I use it everyday. I can check my email and go into netflix anytime I have a few minutes. Shop for a few minutes.<br />It is wonderful. I can carry it in my purse there is no end to it.
My family's 4th Kindle.  The kids have theirs and the adults have their own too.  Everyone is happy!
"Pretty weak to be honest, as if they need more advertising you cant change your background on the kindle as they use it for advertisements. Speaker is pretty quiet and the layout of the kindle with the carousel thing is annoying. Will keep it cause i got it so cheap and don't have another tablet but I am def. looking to upgrade to an ipad soon"
Love it. Screen view seems to be so much more vivid than original kindle.
Great value for the money ! Better than my espectations !
Very good quality
"My first Tablet...So it is hard for me to compare to anything.<br />Am in my mid 70's, and technically challenged.  Therefore, I figured this one would be great to learn with, and am finding it to be awesome.  Sometimes, will get help from grandkids,  Have used the camera, downloaded apps, played a few games.<br />So far, all is great,  still exploring and learning."
"It's Definitely NOT an iPad. I took my time before writing a review. I really wanted to like this. I wanted to use this device to watch Hulu, Netflix, some browsing, shopping or checking email and reading.  My disappointment is the lack of quality on the display. Whenever I am watching Netflix or Hulu, the display is NOT HD. A matter of fact, while watching videos, it's constantly refreshing or recommending I downgrade my video. Sometimes it locks up and I need to shut it down and restart it.  Update: still lousy. I've kept the device updated. I have even updated my apps just in case it was an app issue. No luck there. I have not seen these issues on my  iPad, Apple TV and Fire Stick. They all stream as well as they always have."
"UPDATED REVIEW: After using the new Kindle Fire for a few days, I can see many improvements over the older version. Able to email web pages to self to keep.  Able to use my wireless printer.  Decent search features.  I do wish the special offers were not all for kiddies.  I would like to see more banking apps available.  The battery life is at best a few hours when browsing the internet, however.  I still cannot take screen shots.  Overall, I do like this and it's an improvement over the prior Fire. ***********************  Slow.  Confusing to use. And I own another Fire plus six kindles and another tablet.  Have NOT been able to take screen shots.  Simply won't. Was able to.use wireless printer with it  want to love.it.but cannot.  Where is the users guide?  I've been advised where to find the users guide. The quick set up should include basics like how to take screen shots, etc.  Am reading good books on the kindle fire, and have set up lots of amazon prime videos.Shall see how this works out. Amazon is a great company overall."
Works great. Apps can turn it into different things. One is an alarm clock and another is a radio by using tune_in radio...
Don't buy this ugly heavy pos device save up for an iPad
Good tablet
Great tablet for the money
The kids say the battery power is better. My kids say it is better than our Samsung Galaxy tablet. They also like it bettet than our iPad mini....I personally like the ipad mini better. But i do like it better than the Samsung Galaxy tablet.
Fast Shipper! I really like my Kindle Fire as I am used to many other tablets. It's very easy to use if you want to read or surf the Internet. I wish I had more time to use it but my 8 month old tries to steal it from me lol.
"I bought this and a bluetooth keyboard specifically to be able to write while away from my laptop.  However, it does not work with google docs unless you root it which voids any warranties.  It makes me sad because I really like Amazon and my Kindle Paperwhite, but if they don't want to play well with others then I cannot use them.  I plan to return this and search for a better tablet."
It was delivered quickly and was easy to use right out of the box. Love it!
"Only flaw is it doesn't permit Adobr fladh drive download. Otherwise, it's fine."
SENT IT BACK.  COULD NOT READ IN BRIGHT LIGHT
"This is my 3rd kindle, and so far I really like it. This is the first one with the camera and I like that option. I also have fire sticks on my tv's and this kindle found those without me having to do anything."
I like
Kindle ok. Prime day very disappointing.
I wish it had korean language pack on it
I like it. Its a improvement over the first Fire.
Love it!
"I think I'm going to love this, but as with any new technology (new to me!), it takes me a bit of time to get used to it.  I love the clarity and color of the device, but I also love my paperwhite! I just need to sit down and take the time to learn about it!"
"So far, so good"
I purchased 8GB and only have 5GB of storage space.  I am not happy and seriously considering returning it
"I love the HD Fire, I had the older one and it was starting to feel it's age. :)  The new one rocks, love how when you watch a television show, it has the ability to show you who is in the scene, who they play, etc.  So now when you go, 'I Know that actor/actress from somewhere', you can find out their name and info!"
Love this tablet for my kids especially after I put the parental controls on so my daughter couldn't purchase apps without my permission
So far it has been great
The display is great but it freezes often.
I really did like this. I bought it on the installment plan where you pay around $19.75 a month for however many months till its paid off. I bought it on prime day for $79.00 so it would have been paid off within 4 months. This would have been my second Kindle fire. It was a clear HD screen worked like a charm. The only reason why I sent it back is because my girlfriend bought me an Ipad...and yes this little thing did what I needed it not the camera was a bit sucky and you really cant customize it like you can an Ipad. So the ipad won and this got a one way ticket back to Amazon.
"Very useful, sometimes better than a laptop......."
Great new toy and you can't beat the price. $79 on Prime day
Five Stars
It works nicely. It was a little confusing to use the pre-loaded aps at first but it is getting a bit easier.
I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She says it's the best Kindle she has ever owned.
"Great product, easy for kids and adults to use and picture is excellent."
Faster browsing than my plain Kindle Fire which I've had for 3 years and used many hours a day.  Like that I can take and send pictures. Other than that not much has changed.
Great case for fire hd7. Rugged yet nice looking
there is something different about this new tsblet. it's not like my older fire nd 7. I don't like it as much.
great price.  my daughter loved it!  waiting for next sale to buy one for my sister.
"Yes, it's faster than the first one that came out. My biggest complaint is that every time I open it up........advertisements! Nothing but.....advertisements."
Great
Love it
I like the Kindle Fire but the Silk browser is seriously lacking - hangs too regularly. Glad I found instructions on how to install Chrome.
I purchased this to download Daily Meditations and Alpha Betty Saga.  It works well but Alpha Betty really drains the battery.  Aside from that I like it.  It's my &#34;go to&#34; electronic device at the end of the days work to do my meditation and then play a little.
"I bought the Fire for my kids, my oldest is 9 and my youngest is 7. They love it. It's easy to use, screen size is nice and the clarity is beautiful.<br /><br />Don't forget to set up your parental controls!"
"Easy to use, beautiful clear bright screen. I want it mostly for reading PDFs, which my keyboard Kindle would not do, and it's great."
I have the original Kindle that I got the first day it became available. Finally had to replace since it couldn't hold a charge. It was perfect for what I wanted to do.  I replaced with this Fire HD 7. It's ok but really annoying. There are too many advertisements that keep popping up and blocking what I want to see. I am considering returning it and buying something else without ads. Not worth buying it on sale.  Still not sure about keeping it. Sometimes it freezes up and stops working. I can't attach wireless headphones (thru Bluetooth)  Samsung Gear and for whatever reason it is much slower in downloading thru I Heart Radio and juts  in the middle.<br />I will giver it one more week.
"Too many pop up adds for one. Everything app I want I have to go through Amazon and ones that I really want are for android only. While this was a gift I'll continue and I am grateful, I think I like the iPad More"
I am having a few problems with this kindle fire. The pages freeze at times and the kindle has to be shut down and restarted. This did not happen with my first kindle. I love that the battery life is longer and I love the camera.
"Second kindle for me. I was responsible for the murder of the first. They don't float in the bathtub, even with a Poetic cover.<br />Issues with the second are freezing up, rebooting with poor results, downloading data, won't delete pictures and videos from device, resulting in not enough storage to even delete music. NOT FUN to restore to factory settings. Real pain to restore to my settings.<br />LOTS of time on phone with pleasant Amazon people."
This was a gift for my 82 year old father.  He loves it as he can keep up with email and Facebook.  Plus he loves being able to read books.
"My kids both have one, they love them!!!!"
Got the one without the offers for each of my kids. After using them my wife who hates technology asked for one. So I ordered one for each of us as well. Suggest you get the 16gb as they fill up fast. Wifi capable so only good for internet where you get that but same token no monthly access charges. If you are looking for one that you can use wherever you are this might not be the one for you. You might want to look at one of the cellular tablets with plans.
I love it!
We love our Kindle Fire! The only down side is that I need to buy another because the whole family uses it. I use it for reading and a bit of shopping. My older kids also use it for reading. My younger ones use if for the fabulous FreeTime. It's easily limited to the time and content of my choosing and the kids enjoy the books and games. I've used it for web browsing and its speed is more than enough to meet my needs.
"Does not compare to my first  Kindle Fire, the battery life is shorter it  gets bogged down easily."
"This kindle has pretty poor battery life and lags, it frequently just closes an app an goes to the home screen. I'm thinking of returning it."
Think I try a Nook and hope it works better then the Kindle.  After you pay 200 for it in two months goes on sale for 99
"I was so very disappointed with this product. I bought the original Kindle Fire and honestly it was one of the best tablets I have owned. I really thought that maybe just maybe this one would be somehow similar to it. Nope!!! The first time I used it it froze on me. So I thought that's weird could it be because its new? Nope!! every time I would try to watch a movie on Netflix ( which is basically why I bought it) It would Freeze, and not just freeze but make a loud noise. I am definitely never ever buying a kindle, not with this experience."
I love my Kindle. I've only had it for a few days as my son got it for my birthday. I look forward to using it often. It fits right in my purse so I always have it handy.
"Loving it. Got it on prime day.. Costumer service and support after purchase was outstanding, excellent, rare experience with such a large company!"
Love all graphics.  Too many commercial pop_ups.
Awesome product!!
Awesome! Wish the the app use and the ability to move them around was a little easier but other than that it is really good!
"Love the kindle fire HD, I have 4 kindles and this is my fav so far. And great price"
This could possibly be one of my absolute favorite items that I own! I love it! I use it for practically everything. My kids love it. A hreat product.
"Started out fine, within a week it stopped working.  I can charge it and get an opening page and that's it, as you swipe it open, it just goes black.  Xmas in July my foot, no wonder they were on sale"
I think this is a solid device.  While I don't really like the UI I do find it easy enough to use and have passed this one on to my daughter for games and movies.  I have it in a tough case with a tempered glass screen protector and it has survived numerous falls and tosses without any issue.  It is a pretty speedy device and has performed well with any games I have installed on it.  Very happy with the device.
"Nice speakers and easy to use. Seems to be very durable, but not a lot of memory"
So far so good. Pretty happy with my purchase.
It's hard to navigate and the battery life is awful. My kid can watch one show and nothing else all day long.. And when he picks it up the next day it's out of battery. It almost seems like regardless of how much you use it.. It needs to recharge everyday
love it!!
"I really like this tablet. But it doesn't allow some game downloads which is really inconvienant. No google, no gmail. Not exactly what I wanted but it does get the job done."
Nice.
It me every expectation I had
"I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS KINDLE!"
"OK, it's not a full function tablet.  But for what I want to do - read email, view photos, read at night with the lights out, play some card games, watch videos, all in a very portable format - it is perfect.  I'll still use my paperwhite kindle in the sun, and my android tablet for heavier duty apps.<br /><br />I was worried at first about the ads, but I do not find them intrusive - more like small suggestions in the carousel.  When I am not downloading or using the web I turn airplane mode on.<br /><br />Overall very happy."
"First of all, I wouldn't consider myself an Apple fan boy, but these do not come close to the iPad. Now I have to keep in mind that they are a third of the price... They work pretty well for my kids (I bought one for each of them this last Christmas) but the storage on them is way too small and I constantly have to clear them off. Not super intuitive to use and modify the settings on either. I probably would have returned them if they were for me but since my young kids enjoy them I kept them."
Use it daily and love it
works great
"Shipping took long because the item was not in stock, item is fine"
"Love this, perfect for kids."
"Very good value for the price.  When I bought the device, it was because of the Amazon Prime Day sale so I got stuck with 8MB model (the higher memory device was sold out).  There is a feature (I didn't know about when I purchased) on the Fire that makes more memory desirable:  you can download prime videos to watch at a later date offline.  This is GREAT for car trips where I want my children to watch videos without eating up mobile hotspot cellular data.  With an 8MB model, however, the amount of material than can be stored for offline viewing is limited.  Another huge limitation is being stuck with the Amazon app store and no Google Apps.  BUT, I have learned a great deal about &#34;side loading&#34; apps and this makes the Fire much more useful. (Google &#34;Sideloading Kindle Fire HD&#34;)  The display is great for reading books.  This is a wonderful device for World of Tanks Blitz (which must be side loaded) with amazing graphic detail.  This is a great product for the value (remember, I bought during Prime Day sale).  The only reason for the 4/5 star rating is the limitations caused by 8MB memory and the restriction to Amazon App store to exclusion of Google Apps."
"Can't put it down, bought it for a long flight."
"Well for the price, i guess i shouldnt have expected more. I honestly thought it was going to be as good as an ipad (which i formally owned). Nonetheless, if you need a tablet for a cheap price then buy it. Amazon needs to update more apps in the store (disappointed when Clash of Clans or John GBA app wasnt in their store). Camera isnt as good as an ipad either. Still need to explore the whole tablet some more but all in all its just &#34;eh&#34;."
Junk in my opinion!!! If I could still return it I would.. Both this item and the prime membership is a joke!!!! Spend the extra money for a real tablet.
I like it for the most part.  But the biggest disappointment was when I tried to download one movie and it didn't have enough room.  I have an 8G and out of the box I had less than 3G to do anything with.
Felt cheap. Very cheaply done lighting. Returned.
"Wish before purchasing there was a disclaimer that international recipients need not purchase. Bought it to watch videos and since my credit card is not issued by an american bank, it cant authorize any purchases. Would not recommend if you live out of the US. Limiting considering amazon accepts my money on every other purchase."
"This device was a major let down. I would not recommend it to anyone.  The screen freezes frequently, the internet constantly crashes to the point where it's useless to even try using the internet. The battery doesn't hold a charge for nearly as long as the product description says. The only thing that hasn't caused problems was reading a book.. but if that's all it's good for it would be better to buy a kindle or simple e-reader that's less expensive and functions properly. Do not waste your money on this.   In addition, all the tips about restarting it, and other troubleshooting, help for maybe five mins and it's back to not working again. A device is pointless if you have to try and fix it every five mins."
"Seems pretty good so far. I don't like that I cannot choose my own background (photo) for the device. Also annoying is that the free Aribnb app doesn't work as the one that's 99 cents. I had lots of free &#34;coins&#34; so it didn't really cost me, but even the paid app isn't so great. As I load more apps we'll see how well this thing works."
"We bought one for our 9 yr old daughter tonight.  What they don't tell you is that the lock screen is all adds and you have to pay to have them removed.  Some of these adds are not exactly child friendly, for example an for a game which my husband calls &#34;Game of Boobs&#34; because of the gratuitous boob shot of the animated character.  Never mind the credit card adds.  That right there makes me want to return it and look for a different tablet.  No where on the box does it tell you that you'll be forced to look at adds unless you pay to have them removed.<br />I can't tell you how well it works since we haven't and probably won't be getting to that point.  I get that companies like to make money, but when I buy a product, you've made your money.  I don't deserve to have adds shoved down my throat, and especially down the throat of my kid."
I love it.  So much better than last one as far battery and upgrades.
"I already had an ipad and didn't think I needed another tablet, but -- at least as of mid-2015 -- if you want to download movies for viewing offline, one of these (plus a membership in Amazon Prime) seems to be the only way to go. I'm impressed with the quality for such a great (promotional) price. The advertisements truly are non-intrusive, so all but the most ad-averse probably don't need to spring for the extra money to get rid of them. I'm not giving it five stars due to two drawbacks that really irk me -- the first is the limited number of downloadable options on Amazon Prime. The second drawback is that this can't be connected to a TV, at least not without WiFi (and the specific reason I bought this was for watching videos in a remote location where I don't have a WiFi connection -- in locations where I do have WiFi, there are already other entertainment options). So, it's a good option for one person to watch a video, but not so great for two or more people."
"Well, we haven't had it a year yet, only about 9-10 months and it won't turn on anymore. It will turn on to the lock screen and turn off over and over again. It's un-usable at this point. We have three kindles, two of three are doing the same thing, This kindle and our 7&#34; HDX. When it was working it was decent for a kid, however, only had room for just a handful of apps. The Kindle that does work (mine the larger HDX) is slow and lags a bit, which was a problem with all three Kindles. I think next time we will save the money and get the Galaxy tablet or even better the iPad which is what my wife has (well worth the money by the way). Honestly the only thing we liked about this Kindle was the free play and being able to control what the kids did on the tablet, which is why it gets two stars."
Awesome
Excellent device and for a bargain basement price. I love the free Amazon prime movies and shows. Forget iTunes movies! Way too expansive.
"It's an awesome tablet, very fun and cool plus it is so easy to use."
Still getting it set up
"Awesome price, Awesome product!!"
very pleased with it and  will be even more pleased once I figure out how to get books to read on it.
works even better than expected. has more features than I originally thought. my wife uses this to replace her [aptop and likes it even better
After several years of good and faithful service my old kindle gave up and I had to order a new one. I was not fit to live with until my new kindle arrived. Love my kindle!!!
Just getting started and learning more every day.
"So far, mostly so good. The graphics look great, it's fast to respond, and books are easy to read. On the wi-fi, my Amazon Prime account really makes it awesome because I can catch up missed shows or watch a movie pretty well with it.  What I'm not so impressed with is the amount of bloatware/ads on it. It states it's an 8GB device, but you really only have about 5. The other 3 GBs are taken up by their software and the system.And every time you wake it up, there's an advertisement to buy something on the screen. Oh, and the fact that there is no way to expand the memory is also pretty handicapping if you like to take along movies to watch when you're not on wi-fi. I should have read closer to see that there was no memory card slot because I probably would have passed on this, even with the Black Friday sale discount, had I realized there was no way to extend the memory, short of putting things on the cloud, which won't work if you don't have a wi-fi connection."
Finally wore out my Nook and had been pricing Kindles.  Seemed there was never a great sale on them.  When Amazon had these for the Door-Buster I jumped on it and am thrilled.  Worried a little about just 8 GB but this Kindle holds PLENTY of books and I really only use it as a reader anyway.  Very easy to use and easy to load.  Great buy!
lot of fun
My new BFF!
"I purchased this for my kids during Prime day.  I thought &#34;with special offers&#34; meant some type of promotional trials or the free time trial it mentioned in the site.  IT DOESN'T, it literally means that when you lock your screen, you get ADs on the lock screen.  Not a big deal for me, but my 5 year old doesn't need to see an ad for &#34;True Blood&#34; with half dressed women laying on top of men.  I wouldn't mind if we could set a preference that says &#34;family friendly&#34; or &#34;ads for children&#34; but I honestly find this to be a misrepresentation of the product.  &#34;special offers&#34; makes it sound like I'm getting a deal, instead I'm getting inappropriate ads.  When I contacted Amazon, I was told to have them removed I need to pay another $25 dollars.  WTF.  I just bought three of these and now i need to pay another $75 to NOT have my children exposed to sexed up ads?  I think I will pass and just return them all. I attached a picture of the ad, you guys make your own decision."
"The Fire HD 7 8gb is not the best tablet, and it is not the worst. 3 out of 5"
"Not happy with the app choices.  Opening this up to other android apps woud've made a big difference.  As big of a Prime/Amazon/Audible fan as I am, I won't ever be buying another one."
Like the sound button but it's hard for me to turn off and on.
"Works great, no problems so far, I use it to primarily watch prime content offline. Wifi and Bluetooth work flawless even with the office wpa2 required enterprise level security."
I love it! I bought my first kindle in 2013 and decided it was  time to up-date. Now I use both always have 1 ready to go.
Very good
"Its a great tablet, but its just really annoying that you can't install regular google play apps. You can use 1 Market but this gives issues on some apps. It crashes from time to time, not sure if due to 1 Market installed applications (like Chrome, because, seriously, Silk its a horrible thing).<br />The screen its amazing, and the sound rocks too. It's lame to not allow everybody to use Android as any other tablet, honestly.<br />Also, if you intend to use this tablet on countries outside USA, probably doesn't worth the money."
"extremely disappointed with amazon.  i dont dislike the product, my son actually loves it, we are on our 5th kindle.  i bought this and a couple weeks later saw that the price dropped 40 bucks.  i contacted customer service to see if they could do anything about it; which in their defense they did, they offered to allow me to return the product, which isnt what i wanted, i just wanted them to meet me 1/2 way so he could continue his voracious consumption of their books.<br /><br />unfortunately, they wouldnt meet me 1/2 way, so i will be packing up his kindle and returning it to them.  i suppose i should be happy not spending anywhere for 10-40 bucks a month on books and sometimes on apps."
I brought this for my 6 year old granddaughter and I'm very impressed with the Kindle 7 fire I know she is going to love it.  This has everything she needs.
"Awesome array of stuff to do with this, all for an awesome price!"
Not as happy as I had hoped.  It is much slower and blanks out often.  I don't use it for very much so I didn't send it back.
Excellent device; lots of neat features besides just for reading. Very pleased with the product.
Happy
I love it! Still trying to figure out everything but I had a kindle before and I love them
"My boyfriend surprised me with a Kindle fire, I was so excited. I loved everything about it!!!! Than after awhile the battery stopped holding a charge, so I called Amazon and talked to a very nice representative, she sent me a new one and I sent the broken one back!! I was 37 at this time and I cried like a baby. Than I broke that one in the car when it was between the seats, kids lifted chair up and down, forgot it was there.....Oooops!!! Than I bought a refurbished one on E-Bay and the battery went after two months!!!! Than July 22nd of this year my wonderful Mother and awesome younger Sister bought me the Kindle fire HD 7&#34; for my Birthday.....once again, turning 39....I cried!!! I love this product and would most definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a great tablet!!! Thank You Amazon, Rebecca"
Needs detailed instruction on how to use. After paying over $100.00 for an item and then you must purchase detailed instruction is a big turn off. I can get detailed instruction for a $10 item but not for this. A bit insane!
I bought 3 for my gradkids for Christmas and still going strong. I just bought 1 more for my husband. He love's it.
"Love it! The Fire is my Kindle, Email, Facebook Companion, Online Shopping device all in one! I only need the one device in my purse. And I got it on sale, it is worth the price I paid for it and more!"
"I ordered this is April with a steep price cut.  I finally started using it in June.<br />It is very useful HOWEVER today i dropped it 18 inches and the screen shattered.<br />Customer service basically said that it was my fault and they'd give me a<br />10% discount on a new one. This is not guerilla glass. I have never even<br />chipped a screen before and this one is finished after one rather short fall.<br />No, I will not replace it because I fear a repeat.  When I think how often I have<br />dropped my various cellphones (probably many dozens of times from higher heighrts) with no<br />damage.  so either buy a good cover or skip buying a kindle,. I do not want the<br />extra bulk of a cover.  It was good while it lasted."
"It is pretty good for what I need it to do, however it is hanging up on some things and I have to power it off and turn it back on to get it to move.<br />Very frustrating since I bought it to use for my work.  My 1st fire would die after the battery was down to 60% and Amazon could not fix it.<br />Sorry guy's but it does have some very good features."
"I have no complaints about my new Kindle.  I had a first Gen, Kindle Fire and the improvements speak volumes as to what Amazon has done in<br />R & D.  So much easier to use.  I love the cameras, the new features that sync with other devices for pictures, etc.<br />My non-tech husband even loves it's ease of use."
"Great; as advertised, BUT:  It would be useful if you had an operator's manual which could be downloaded by your buyers.  Yes, I know that there is a tutorial loaded on the unit, but a downloadable manual would substantially add to the usefulness; and besides, you could probably sell more, because all your happy users would tell others about your great user's manual!!<br />T. Steven"
Handy when laptop is too much for just email and social media checks.
"It's fantastic!! Great for traveling, internet works fast, reading outside yes outside it works!!! If you are looking for a lower cost alternative to the iPad look no further! Can't figure out why parents don't purchase for kids?!? The only slight issue the battery can drain when using wifi or maybe I haven't figured out the reason!"
I love the kindle great apps
Its more than what i expected!
Great product
"Resolution is very good.  Speed and WiFi reception is good while close to source but not very good at distances where my old laptop is very a good.<br />Biggest disappointment is battery life.  My iPad last many days while idle , this drains at a much higher rate.<br />For the price I paid (discounted in July) its ok, but I would be disappointed if I paid full price."
Love my kindle fire! Wished the battery charge lasted longer!
Will it hold up? That's my question.
"So far, so good! Got this as a Bday gift for my 7 year old son to play games on and he loves it so far. Now, to find some educational games...."
Love it easy to use and love the color and large print
"Exactly what it says, thanks"
Meh. It always closes my apps and freezes up and I've only had it 2 weeks
"Good tablet, great price."
no. it froze up and wasn't what I was told by the reps it was and it is in the process of being returned.
"Fire HD is way too limited due to no Google apps available.<br />The Android version you get is buggy and slow (takes forever to open Facebook or Twitter, or fail to open web links from Twitter).<br />Tablet is bulky and the back made of cheap plastic, but I guess that's what you got for that price.<br />Battery life is not good, was going to use it after it stayed on the shelf for a few days, and battery was almost dead."
"I bought it for my mother, 74 year young she is, and she loves it! My only regret is hers is newer than mine...I should have purchased two!"
"The Fire HD is a fine little tablet but please do your research, as I wish I had. I was replacing a second generation Kindle to take to Europe. I assumed that the Fire had all the same qualities as the Kindle, with some added enhancements. Not so. The screen does not allow reading in the sun, as does a Kindle, and the device does not download books using Whispernet, as does a Kindle, which was a distinct advantage in rural France where internet is spotty.  Since I already carry an iPad when I travel, the Fire is more of a redundancy than enhancement. I hope my lack of due diligence informs others."
"Overall this is a good general purpose tablet.  As a purchase for my teenage daughter, however, I would have hoped for more options with respect to parental controls.  The limitations to have personalized wallpaper and the constant ads are also a reason why I would not rate this any higher."
Not too intuitive
"I'm still 'learning' about this gadget.  Unfortunately, I'm not the most tech savvy and at the moment I'm finding it a bit restrictive.  Need more time to play around with it.  Takes nice photos by the way."
I had the Kindle Touch which I used very seldom.  I can't put my new Fire HD 7 down.  So simple to use and I love the larger screen.  So far my favorite purchase from Amazon.
I have had my Kindle about 1 month now and have been extremely pleased with it. I am an avid reader and this has made acces to books ery convenient. I joined Kindle unlimited.
Don't buy. Piece of crap!!! It won't even download one game!!
"We have been using fire tables for many years HD 7 is great.  My biggest problem was the slow delivery service.  I ordered on Prime special deal day and had to wait until the July 27.  When you pay extra for &#34; 2 day free delivery&#34;, that's what you should get."
"I LOVE this thing!!!!!!! Highly recommend... I am not &#34;tech savvy, and I can do this. Absolutely wonderful."
"Main reason for purchase was deep discount offered on Prime Day.  All I wanted from the Kindle Fire HD 7 was to read my Kindle books that have color illustrations, maps, diagrams, etc. (because our [original] iPad shows blurry edges around most fonts and illustrations).  Fire HD 7 far exceeded my expectations.  I can listen to my Prime music, videos, etc.  Still haven't tried other capabilities yet (e.g., taking photos), but I'm very pleased with this deal."
"it works well, but did not come with the black case."
Love it
The ads on the lock screen are annoying<br />but the device is great overall
This device really sucks. The screen is not responsive and very difficult to click on the area you want. I thought it would be similar in quality to the iPad but not even close
On my 3rd replacement device.  They keep sending me refurbed ones.  They don't last.
Love it. The new format is much more like a computer tablet than my first generation Fire.
It's a great device.
Love it.
This is my first tablet so I'm still getting used to it but so far I've signed on to WIFI (first time) with no one instructing or helping me.  I downloaded Candy Crush & I can access my Facebook page.  I've also accessed internet search but find it difficult compared to my computer and unstable when using maps (like on ReMax).  Maybe it's me.  I am an elderly newbie.
"Keeps freezing up :( luckily my son told me to hold down the on off button & the volume buttons at the same time & it totally brought it back to life!! Hope I don't need to do this often. Before that started happening,  I loved my new fire ."
I have the original kindle and this one is amazing love all the new updates!!!
Love it!
Love it!
"Easy and convenient to use. Great for that something to take anywhere you want to stay connected with Wi-Fi, reading or games."
We initially purchased the kids edition...very unhappy with the memory.  We returned it and purchased this one and we have been happy since!
Very good
"Used to older 8.9&#34; so this is totally different animal.  Several improvements but hard to press power button when charging because too close together.  I also really miss volume control being in quick menu; Firefly might be occasionally used, certainly doesn't need to be that handy.  I am clumsy and have trouble with buttons on edges.<br />Otherwise this is nice little device.<br /><br />* posted by daughter who uses it"
"Works as intended. I need to find out how to stop the quick drain on the battery though. I have to plug it in too much and I think programs are constantly searching for something I know nothing about. Still when I get that taken care of. Sound, picture, speed are all great. And Love My Prime Video!"
"I was trying to replace my water logged 7&#34;HD fire. The new one is heaver, smaller and doesn't fit my magnatic case. DISAPOINTED WAITED OVER 6 WEEKS.  IT'S NOT THE SAME!"
"I absolutely love my new Fire HD 7 ... wish the battery had a longer life, but other than that, it is awesome!"
Exactly what I wanted!!  Wish the battery life was a better..  Just make sure to bring charger with me!
"I'm falling in love with the Fire HD7 and the custom Amazon features. However, the device does glitch from time to time, freezing. I'm not sure if this is normal."
"Got it during the Prime day...awesome machine, especially for the price!"
"With a product that is on its 7th series and is the mainstay for its group, one would expect a more solid construction. That's not to say this thing is lightweight. It's anything but that. However the rear panel feels as though it is about to fall off.<br /><br />And, is it possible to lighten up on the Amazon tie ins? I get it. Amazon Kindle. But, do I really need to do EVERYTHING through Amazon?"
"Love it.....streaming almost everything..... love the prime music, the prime movies, Netflix, etc."
"Great item, works well and arrived fast, would buy from again!"
"Disappointed in the thickness and weight of this tablet, it has a very cheap plastic feel and very boring design, I prefer my 2nd gen fire to this one. The upgrade to the processor and screen are nice and it preforms OK, glad I only spent 70 bucks for it on Prime day. I have an ASUS 7 inch tablet (ME176C) that was only 149 at Best Buy that runs full Android has twice the ram (2 Gig) and higher resolution screen 1920x1200 and is much thinner with better battery life and 16 Gig of storage. There are better option in the 140 price then this Kindle Fire HD7."
I bought two tablets for my boys and I love it and they love it!!!! I love the parental controls so I can set what they do.... I have it set that they have to do 45 mins of reading in order to unlock the apps and videos. I also have it set to turn off at a certain time and will unlock at the designated time ( so I don't have to worry about them sneaking and playing late at night). This tablet is fast and very durable. The battery life is really great compared to most tablets.
"I  did not realize that the tablet would be flooded with constant ads for apps. I wish I knew how to remove them.  I'm grateful my child knows better than to buy them, but parents be careful about that being part of the package. I already purchased the protection plan for 3 years or i would likely have returned it."
For kids an 8GB is not nearly enough storage space for games.  To add space is an issue and a hassle.  It asks you to delete games once the storage is getting full and kicks you off of WiFi as well. I'm not that impressed and would advise to buy the highest GB for your kids and spend the money or just use these for reading and the like only.  JMO
Love it one of the best.
"I enjoy my Fire HD 7 a lot, it is more sensitive to touch than my previous Fire and has cameras. The only thing that has been frustrating with it is that if freezes/cashes on me at least once a day requiring me to do a hard reset. Other than that, it is a great device."
Really happy with my new Kindle Fire
Love it
Love this
It's perfect and better than any other tablet I've own.
"Far better than the previous model. Faster, better clarity and options on every application, and far more adjustment features on the reader. It's lighter and the battery lasts longer too. I've never liked the opening screen layout - need to see if I can place all books and icons fixed on the screen in a smaller format."
"I have an iPad mini and just got the fire. I am a bit underwhelmed by the screen quality (frequently see pixels) and short battery life. It is nice to be able to download shows from Amazon Prime, which is a feature I will definitely use and enjoy. Perhaps a higher end model would be better? All in all, it will serve its purpose and is a much cheaper alternative to Apple products."
Great
need adobe flash player
I love this tablet! I bought it for my kids; I like how I can set time constraints and limit what they are allowed to watch/do.
"won't show up in my devices, husband lost everything & can't do anything except surf web & facebook. did factory reset, live chat with customer service, & reregister - nothing still screwed up. my kindle that shows up works great though."
"I bought this just to read books on, but I was surprised at how well it worked for other things.  The only drawback for me is that it is not as versatile as I would like, as far as reading other file formats besides the Kindle format."
"Not happy with this purchase. Got this as I was sick of my nexus 7 working like a snail (why do pretty much all tablets and phones suck after one year?) but this isn't much better. I liked the kindle app on the nexus better (highlighting is a three click process here) and the whole thing is painfully slow most of the time. I only use it to read or occasionally stream netflix. And it started acting like this within about two months. On top of all that, about every other day, when I swipe it open, it's just a blank screen with the only the top bar showing and is unresponsive. That requires a restart."
Good price but did not work properly.  I have returned it for a refund.
great product. my son loves it!
"Great price on Prime day. The case is a cheap filling plastic and rough on back where letters are molded into it. Plug is difficult to get into the USB port, but for the money it's a very lightweight handy tablet."
A+
Good display fast acting
"I purchased the Fire HD 7 on prime day with the special offers. Special offers are ads on your fire hd, which I did not know about until the day I received it. I did not like how the interface looked, with the rather large Most Recent icons up top and the same icons at the bottom but in smaller size. I found it useless, cluttered, and a waste of space. I had no use for many of the pre-installed apps and features on the Fire HD 7, such as firefly, free time (meant as parental controls for children's use), the Help app, and contacts. Many apps from the app store are not able to be downloaded on the Fire HD, and a lot of the apps I have on my iPhone such as youtube and instagram don't exist for the Fire HD either. The camera isn't that great, in my opinion. It's not HD either. The iPhone and iPad cameras are top notch compared to Fire HD 7. The home screen and lock screen cannot be customized at all, in any shape or form. There is no option for wallpapers or to change the way it looks. The preset wallpaper slideshow on my lock screen freaked me out and gave me the heebie jeebies because they're macro photos (close to it) and photos of plants and nature, which I do not like. I rather have a picture of a cute dog from my camera roll as my wallpaper. (Cant do much with your photos but to upload them onto social networks and edit and print)<br />One thing I do like, is the emoticons in your keyboard. They're different than the emojis on an iPhone keyboard and are actually cute!<br />Overall, I didn't really like the Fire HD 7 as much as I thought I would. The device does not allow any customization whatsoever and includes lots of features (the ones that aren't listed on the description) and apps that I have no use for. The camera isn't HD as it says it is, it's not even close to hd. Nothing to be excited about honestly. I like my technology to be savvy, customizable, and minimal. I'm returning mine, but maybe the Fire is best suited for someone else with different needs?"
Great so far
This is my 5th kindle and I love it. I just hope the charging port lasts longer than the last one.
"Great clarity, ease  of use and lots of movies/shows to choose from. App store offers many choices and is user friendly."
"It came really fast and the feature to watch on my tv with hdmi cord is nice. The only bad thing is the battery life. My old kindle fire, not hd, lasted much longer."
Love this. Operates more like a smartphone than my regular Kindle Fire.
"This is such an amazing device! I am using it for many different tasks already, and it's quickly replacing my laptop for many things. I don't notice much difference in what I can do with it compared to my boyfriend's iPad - I am so happy with the Kindle!"
This is an excellent device.. Unfortunately after reviewing it I decided it was not for me.. I choose to distance myself from a device that will detract from personal attention to more important issues such as not being focused on device rather than personal human to human conversation and dialogue.. The device is excellent....It is just not for me in relationship to my concern on being aware of more important items such as being able to communicate with life without facebook tweet etc.
I love this and am still learning new things on it.
"I really enjoy it.I have used it to message,buy online, and stream music in my car.I really recommend it to people who want a convenient tablet experience ."
"I got this upgrade during Prime Day after my 6 was stolen. I was a bit worried when I felt it, as the material seems cheaper than its predecessor, but so far I haven't had a single issue."
Still learning to use it --- so far OK
Just learning how to use it but so far so good.  Love it so far.
Great price and all functions are so fast. Love it.
"Bought for my 5 year old daughter with an awesome case for it and works PERFECT! I LOVE the kindle! Always have! It's perfect for all my daughters games and learning apps, and plays Netflix and movies with perfect clarity. GREAT sound too, loud and clear! Love kindle! My loyalty to kindle even got my sister to order one for her daughter, they're also heavy duty and are perfect for kids!"
Amazing!!!!
"Very, very pleased!"
Easy to use even for a older person.
"I was very disappointed in the Amazon Fire HD 7 because I can't access many of the apps that I normally use. In all other respects, I have no complaint and therefore give it  a two star rating. However, after sufficient trial, I have decided to return it."
Have only had it a few days but the graphics are wonderful.  Was easy to set up and seems to hold a charge longer than my original  Kindle Fire.<br />I got a real deal on this.  Very Satisfied.
"Love it, Its such a great investment...."
Daughter doesn't like it because it can't get the Instagram app. But I love it! 😀
Nice
"ordered this for my mom she wanted something that is easy to use for seniors like her, she loved the tablet and she loved the color"
It was just what I exp
"Long delivery.  It took 30 days for this thing to come from China...  However, the product quality was worth the wait."
so far so good! love it
Works well and received when they said I would.
"I had the original Kindle Fire (a hand me down from my wife) and liked it. However, it was slow for web browsing and email viewing.  This Kindle is much, much faster. I think the build quality is decent though not as sturdy as the original. It might also have a shorter battery life than the original. However, for the money, I think it's a good deal."
Delivered as described
"Love it, well worth the price."
"I bought his for myself as a birthday gift and I just love it.  I spent a good deal of time trying to decide if I should get the plain HD or the HDX.  I even looked at the Paperwhite and the Voyage and I was tempted by the Voyage.  But I have owned a first generation Kindle Fire since 2011 and have loved it and I already own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 for all those things for which you need a powerful tablet (that would be last year's birthday gift also purchased on Amazon).  So I compromised on the HD since I will use it primarily for reading.  I prefer the 7&#34; size for reading and the 10&#34; size for day-to-day tablet use but the 10&#34; is too big for my tastes for reading a book.  Buy at least the 16GB of memory and pay the fee to have no advertising.<br /><br />I had no trouble setting it up, frankly it couldn't have been easier, but I suspect that is because I am a long-time Kindle user and Amazon customer. I signed in and it was good to go. Then I re-registered my original Kindle to my husband and got him set up.  He is very tech-resistant and I tease him that the Kindle is the gateway drug to tablets.  I also told him I was not buying him any more physical books.  The original Kindle still works fine.  The primary reason I bought a new one for myself was to get him into an ereader.<br /><br />I do not find it to be much more fragile than the first gen model although it is lighter and trimmer.  But as with any technology, if you bounce it off the tile floor or the concrete driveway of course you will have a problem.  Get a good case.  (I have had several Fintie cases.  They are stylish, provide adequate protection and are well-priced so if you grow tired of it, it gets soiled or just wears out you can get another.  You can get them here.  See my reviews.  I have them on all my electronic devices.)<br /><br />I had temporary separation anxiety for my original Kindle but I got over it within a day after I discovered everything I was accustomed to in the interface was indeed still there but was improved, though organized slightly differently and more conveniently.  Best I can say is that the interface resembles the Kindle app for tablets and phones.  I like it better than the original.<br /><br />If you buy one remember this tip.....You're going to want to turn off the highlighting.  It's under &#34;View&#34;,  &#34;View Options&#34;, &#34;More Settings&#34;.  Amazon, this incredibly annoying feature should be off as default.  I had to spend an hour on line to find this answer and it seems I was not alone.ace was indeed still there but was improved, though organized slightly differently and more conveniently.

"Even on a new device, I can't get my Amazon Cash Register to work properly as the Administrator.  Called 3 times, was promised a call back twice, am still hopeful I get an answer or find a way to get my money out.  Probably should have gone with the square but I love Amazon stuff."
Love it just a little glitchy
Only last 3 weeks then I had to return it for a new one. The first one wouldn't turn on! Al least Amazon customer service is good!
Love it!  Email great!  Bright backlit reading in total darkness is splendid. lsb
"I got this to upgrade my old first gen fire. I wish I hadn't. There were no issues with my old one, I just figured a newer one would be even better and this was on sale so I went for it.<br />I can't put into words how cheap this new gen is build wise. The back is just plastic and I'm worried just being in my purse without a protector will ruin it.<br />I truly regret this purchase."
"What a joke. Just got this a couple days ago and noticed the background on the lock screen displays advertisements.  &#34;Surely, this must be a default setting until I change to a photo.&#34;  WRONG. Couldn't find how to change the background or lock screen in the manual so I email the support.  This feature is not available yet but they forwarded my request to the development people.  Wait, I'm sorry.... you didn't KNOW already that people wouldn't want to see advertisements every time they look at their kindle?  Smells like a load of b.s.. Great job, Amazon.  I am telling you because you are a company that deserves to know what your consumers think of your products and other consumers deserve to know, too.  Quit joking around and let people personalize their device.  I never even thought this would be a problem because NO ONE DOES THAT.<br /><br />I'm not even going to bother commenting on other aspects of this device because this is ridiculous.  Change your product and I'll change my review."
Best Tablet on a budget. really snappy performance from the quad core processor. Loving it.<br />Never knew that Amazon built such a good tablet. Would recommend it to anyone.
"I am a techie and work with computers every day.  I have a desktop, laptop, Dell Tablet and you know, sometimes all you need is simple.  Love my Kindle Fire HD, use it most every day.  I use it for e-mail, news updates, browsing to research items, you tube to help me fix my tractor at home, and for digital magazines I check out from our library.  It is light, easy, works Great and the best part - No Windows Updates  =)"
Sharpness of picture is awesome.  Very user friendly...
"The problem with an upgraded product is that the developers sometimes, seeking to better its features, actually tweak it in a way that makes it less user friendly."
A great product. Perfect for my love of reading and also for my grand daughter to play games on. Enjoying it's many uses. Works great!
Loving my new Kindle Fire!  Lightweight and easy to grab-n-go. Also like being able to do quick internet searches and so much more! Worth every penny!
"My husband is pretty much confined to the house  and this makes his life bearable. He can read, play games, surf the net and keep his mind occupied."
A little sluggish when multiple apps are being run but over all a great inexpensive tablet. The amazon drive with photo sync is awesome too!
It's fine.
"I have a Fire HD 7, 7&#34; display current model. This cover does not fit. Leather cover hides forward facing camera, and covers the on/off button. Not happy with this cover."
"Bought it for the wife for jury duty, to replace a Samsung which was crap from day one, she didn't have to go Ha ha . My dad loved his at 86 he used it all the time, now my sister has it and wont put it down."
Love it. Just started using it.
I have had a few different kinds of tablet for my kids and the kindle is the best of them all. Is has been the most durable of them all. One of the best features that I like is you can block all purchases even those that are free. On most of the android tablets with the App Store if they are free you can't block kids from downloading them like on the kindle.
I was a little disappointed that no instructions came with this device.
A long needed replacement for my Kindle Keyboard.  It is working perfectly.  Thank you.
works like a charm
Love it -  it works great
Perfect.
Love my fire tablet! The price was great.
My 5 year old son loves his.... we've had no problems freezing up.
It was a gift to me and it works as expected.
"Amazing graphics, durability, customer service, speed, and camera.  Highly recommend!"
"My husband purchased me a kindle fire seven years ago. I loved it.I purchased him a kindle firehd six months ago he loves it. When the kindle hd 7 went on sale I had to get on. My old kindle didn't have the new features so I had to update, it takes beautiful pictures, hd is fantastic"
Good Product
Upgrading from the Kindle Fire to the HD 7 was simple and painless.
A gift for grandma! She loved it!!!
"Fast little tablet! The HD is awesome and it has good speakers. It took a little while to understand the home page and favorites. Not sure I like the carousel though, it puts every app you open on the carousel and you have to manually remove them to make it less cluttered. I would prefer the carousel be your favorites and not everything opened. I am used android tablets and how easy it is to customize the look of your tablet, there is no way (that I have found) to change the background - not a deal breaker by any means, but I like different backgrounds.<br /><br />Overall LOVE the tablet and very happy with it!!"
"I loved my Kindle Fire HD!  I purchased it for approximately $150 and used it almost 24/7 for almost 3 years.  I used it to play music, stream music, watch movies/shows, manage and edit photos and graphics, listen to audio books, participate in social media, send/read e-mail from 3 different accounts and even occasional read books.  I used it at the office, at the beach, in the car, in the woods and in every room of my home.  I have taken my Kindle EVERYWHERE - EVERYDAY.  I have dropped the Kindle, spilled beverages on the Kindle, tossed the Kindle around, sat/slept on the Kindle,  allowed small kids to use the kindle,  and once my cat puked on my Kindle.  My Kindle HD held up to all of the abuse and kept ticking.  I found the promotional ads easy to ignore.  The text to speech function for mobi documents has been a lifesaver - and is possibly my favorite feature.  Given how much I used the Kindle and how little I paid for it -- this was one of the most cost effective purchases of my lifetime. While there are probably other tablets that do more and do it better --- the Kindle HD is still an AMAZING value. The only cons were the lack of availability for some desired apps (Instagram) and the durability of the charging port.  My Kindle was originally purchased without a charger and that was an added cost.  Eventually, even with an official Kindle charger from Amazon the charging port wore out.  For the last 6 months it has become increasing difficult to get the Kindle to charge and to stay charged.  After consulting with very helpful Amazon tech support staff, my Kindle has been declared dead and I have ordered an new Kindle Fire HDX -- this time a 32g model to store more audio books and photos."
I love it and so does my daughter. Wish I had two
"But since I bought it on prime day, that price was 79 bucks. Therefore this is the best 79 buck tablet I have ever had.<br />Easy to use, easy to set up your email, browser is pretty fast and apps load quickly. I also like that I can download a movie to watch later and do not have to be connected to WIFI and stream everything.<br />However I don't like that of the 8 gigs only 5 are actually usable. You download a couple movies, a couple books, a few hundred songs and an app or 2 and that is it, you are told you are out of space. You can not uninstall anything that is preloaded so can only uninstall the things you downloaded yourself, 3 gigs are used up by the operating system. 5 are for your own use.<br />I am also not as impressed with the camera as some people seem to be. My cell phone takes better pictures and videos than this kindle fire.<br /><br />The picture is very sharp, and the sound is much better than I expected for a tablet this size, which makes it a great portable music player whether streaming music from prime or listening to what you have downloaded to the device.<br />The ads don't really bother me since they only appear when the tablet is sleeping or otherwise not in use. It is not like they pop up while you're reading a book or watching a movie. Though on the subject of reading I prefer my good old fashioned plain kindle ereader for books, I have never been crazy about reading on any tablet or computer including this one.<br /><br />It claims the battery is good for 8 hours of &#34;mixed use&#34; but if that &#34;mixed use&#34; includes a lot of video or streaming it does not last nearly that long.<br />I bought this because the prime sale occurred right after my Asus infinity transformer died and I did not have hundreds of dollars to replace it. I do miss the 10 inch screen on my asus and a 7 inch no matter how sharp and defined just can not compare, however I doubt I would have found anything better for the price. I do not think I would have bought this at full price,  I would say if you are thinking of getting the 8gig for heavy use and plan to download lots of apps or more than 1 movie at a time you are better off to spend the extra for the 16 GBs because 8 gets used up way too fast when you are really only allowed to use 5.  I doubt I will do a lot of movie watching on this tiny screen but I think it will be nice as we get into hurricane season to have a device I can watch a movie on even when I lose my internet and electricity. Even if the battery does die right after the movie;.are thinking of getting the 8gig for heavy use and plan to download lots of apps or more than 1 movie at a time you are better off to spend the extra for the 16 GBs because 8 gets used up way too fast when you are really only allowed to use 5.  I doubt I will do a lot of movie watching on this tiny screen but I think it will be nice as we get into hurricane season to have a device I can watch a movie on even when I lose my internet and electricity. Even if the battery does die right after the movie;."
The Fire HD 7 fully meets my expectation.
"It is good that you can now take pictures or video now. It is also good that this newer version can receive the same apps that I already have on my older Kindle, so that my wife also has them. My biggest problem is that one of the main reasons that I bought this updated version of the Kindle, was the ability to mirror pictures, apps, etc. onto my TV, but I have not been able to accomplish this and will have to contact Amazon to find out why this is not happening."
"This is the 3rd kindle fire I purchase.  I bougt first generation as a gift for my daughter three years ago. We got this one of this on november for her 20th. birthday and this one was stolen. Now we bought this one to replace it as she was devastated with her loss. She is an avid reader. This is an awesome tablet, sturdy and reliable.  My daughter loves her kindle fire!"
"I absolutely love this device. The 7-inch screen is perfect for a reading device, and is visible even in sunlight (albeit with minor glare issues). The special offers are not bad at all. They present themselves in a screen every time you unlock the screen, but simply swipe them away and they are gone until the next time you lock the screen."
I had my first Kindle Fire for 4 years! I finally died! I love my new one and hope it last as long or longer!
Love them!
"I purchased this kindle fire hd on Amazon Prime day & was excited I only had to wait 2 days to get it. Then, to my pleasant surprise, it showed up the next day!! I've had a kindle fire before (which I dropped & the screen shattered) so I knew what to expect from this product & it didn't disappoint. I'm a huge reader & consider my kindle like a baby. If you love to read, this is definitely the kindle for you. I also love that it directly links to my goodreads account. I love the color options. I got white & absolutely love it. I would definitely purchase this item again."
I love how easy it is to figure out things on it. It also has great viewing
i LOVE IT!
"My old kindle keyboard version stopped working with &#34;collections&#34; which made it really inconvenient to locate books (especially those I had purchased and not read (I had every thing read in collections (i.e. Dickens, etc.) and this left unread items at the top of my display.  When collections stopped working (?????software change????) everything was just jumbled.  Thinking my old reader was expiring, I purchased a new, gen 4, Fire HD 7.  Received it yesterday, tickled pink - UNTIL I tried to organize my reading material into collections.  After messing with this thing (help books are no help) for a full day I gave in and contacted Kindle Customer Service.  Was disconnected twice before I got to Teri (what a darling).  The problem was (and still is) that there is not a single thing you can do to mark or remove books from the main cloud listing once you have put them (a link only I think) into a collection.  You are left with a collection of similar books (or authors) and cloud listing of many, many books with no indication  that they have been previously included into a collection.  I had to pencil (yes I still have one) a list of each collection to check against my large cloud listing to determine if I had included everything into the collection of my choice. Needless to say, I am going book by book to locate the 10 or 12 I had saved for later reading.  I also know that any future purchases will be manually included into a collection as they are purchased. Why, oh why, can we not create cloud collections in the manage my content page on Amazon..com ?? Why can we not indicate beside each purchase which collection (if any) the book resides in.  I have done some programming and this does not present a major obstacle.  We already get several choice now,. why not one more and why not a column that contains the individual collection name of our choice.  COME ON AMAZON - EMPOWER US AND HELP US REALLY MANAGE OUR CONTENT!!!  Had I realized the original problem (software change????) with my old Kindle Keyboard was gong to be present on my new fancy FIRE HD 7 I probably would not have purchased it!!!  TERI, WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE REP, did a lot of research, talked to a lot of people, checked a lot of places, and finally admitted that what I want done (somehow separating items in collections from the rest of my library of books, cannot be done!  thank you Teri for finally giving me an answer.  if anyone knows how to do this, please let us know."
I like it a lot.
Love it!
Really love the fire hd 7 7&#34; after suffering thru two nuvision tablets that sounded like a good deal but both malfunctioned after a few weeks . the kindle is everything I wanted and more.
"Cheap plastic case, wayyy too thick, 4 gigs of space is gone in seconds, no Google Play Store, No Clash of Clans which was the main reason I was getting a tablet. This is a piece of trash when compared to similar devices that I have purchased at even lower prices on sale. Stay far away from this heaping pile of a tablet"
I love my new Fire HD 7!<br />It is great. This is my 3rd Kindle and I wouldn't choose anything else.
The case is cool.
"Great overall package, great picture, hd screen, good speakers, front and rear camera, good menu controls."
Love it. Vivid display and fast response. Cloud storage and free music and free books. It's the ideal size to take with you.
"Small, but powerful!"
Oh so very disappointed in amazon for this kindle. Waste of money. Do not buy this product. Absolute worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. I wish I could return it and get my money back.
"Bought this item for my mother who isn't very tech savvy, but she's found it easy to navigate and uses it all the time. Never would I ever have imagined she use a tablet, but there she is surfing away. :)"
I love it! Perfect size and so easy to set up and use my favorite apps!
Great product!
"The ads on the display when the tablet wakes are absolutely annoying (special offers app).  I tried to delete/disable the app through the settings and could not.  I searched online how to do it and found a website that wants $15 to remove the app.  This is unbelievable, I've never had a device do this.  I'm tempted to root the device and reformat it without the kindle but other than the ads I do like the interface of the Fire.  The picture is clear and the sound is good.<br /><br />Another con is not all apps can be installed on it like andriod phone.  You can get around that if you are &#34;computer savey&#34; but a regular user wouldn't know any better.  For the price, especially on Amazon Prime day, it was great.  If I paid full retail price for this, I'd send it back."
"The speakers on this sound better than my laptop, I love it!"
Somewhat slower to load and setup than the 6 but worth the sale price!
"Even though it is a 2014 version, I love love love this Kindle.  It has integrated into my life as if I have had one for years.  Very user friendly ... worth the price ... and can't put it down ..  Does everything I need .. so there's no downside so far."
Just got this one. I had the first generation Fire up until this point. LOVE the better speakers and the charging port &#34;seems&#34; to be better than the first gen (which I had to replace once due to charging issues) So far so good. Still get the great clarity on the screen. Lighter weight and lets face it....Color is AWESOME!
Awesome upgrade!
My Granddaughter loves it.
"Bought as a gift for my wife who said she did not want it, she was happy with her laptop. Well, I purchased the Fire HD anyway and I haven't seen her use the laptop since. She loves it."
Picture quality is fantastic. clear and precise. Easy to use. Audio is very good too. Great product.
I haven't found anything that I don't like yet. Emails and internet are super fast.
Great bang for your buck.  Battery life is good and the resolution and responsiveness are decent.
I am very pleased with7in. Kindle case.
Somewhat disappointed as an original kindle fire owner I expected so much more. Have had difficulty navigating some websites. So overall this is an average product.
Very fast and reliable
"Don't even know where to start with how bad this  is, I am forced to use only apps from the amazon app store witch sucks. And am constantly being forced to see advertising on the kendle then there is how cheap it feels. Wasted my money on 2 of these and can't even give them away."
My fourth fire device. I have amazon prime and it makes these devices a well priced asset.
I already wrote my thoughts on this transaction. I will live with it. It was a good price. But not exactly what I wanted.
Tablet would be great if the dang thing wouldn't randomly log you off. Seems to be a well known issue with the Kindle Fire. I have spent way to long trying to work with tech on getting the issue resolved. One of their go to moves if the system is up to date on software is to make you reset to factory settings :-( angry with that ....
This was a birthday gift for my 8yr. old granddaughter. She was completely ecstatic.
Really Like It.
Love it and amazon is great.  My mom bought this for me 2 weeks before prime day on 7/15 paid full price.  They gave her credit so she received the sale price without any questions which was great.  Thanks
My friend was happy with it and loved the clarity of the pictures.
Love the fire easy to get around in. Now I don't have to wait for my wife to get done with our IPad.
Wow! So easy to use and the display is crystal clear!
"Just received my Kindle Fire, would be nice to have more product information included, instructions etc.  You can't set anything up unless you have Wi-Fi access, so I had to wait until I was at a Wi-Fi hot spot to register and set up my Fire.  Then I started downloading Apps, games, books, etc. then later found out they were going into a Cloud account, and not on my device.  So I had to go back to the Wi-Fi hot spot to move them down from the cloud to my device.  It may take a day or two to figure my new Fire out, but I'll get there."
Love it! Was pleasantly surprised much better than I thought it would be . I can get Internet better with it then my iPad when I am outside . Great for my audio books when I do not want to read my Kindle . Very good value .
"I guess you get what you pay for. This is strictly meant to be used as a reader. The internet and app functions are slow and sometimes don't even work at all. I have to see ads every time I turn it on, which is very annoying. It was very inexpensive so at least I didn't over pay. If you want to do more than just read books just get a regular tablet, amazon has some bugs to work out."
Just what my wife wanted and she loves it.
"Didn't work.  Stuck on word fire.  Just got replacement today. So far, working great.  Was really miffed that replacement was marked refurbished.  I really think I should have gotten another new kindle.  The deal was on prime Friday so kindle was $79. I guess that means 2nd class.  Hope it holds up!"
"I was not expecting the preloaded ads that I had to pay $15 to have removed. I don't know, maybe I missed the &#34;subsidized discount&#34; somewhere in the fine print, but that was sneaky Amazon. My grade for this customer experience is Z."
"It was not what I wanted after all. Very awkward to read on, which was the main reason I wanted it. I thought I'd like it but did not. If you mainly want something to read on and shop on and email on, splurge and get a bigger tablet."
Got it for my granddaughter and we both love it.
"This is our 4th Kindle and have loved them all - each has been move advanced than the last and just what is wanted/needed. Have had trouble finding the &#34;perfect&#34; case for this new Kindle Fire HD 7 - 4th Generation, but hope the perfect one will arrive in the mail tomorrow!"
TOO AMAZON SPECIFIC...<br />8 GB IS NOT ENOUGH
"It's great..for me it is better than my last one.. I like I can take pictures and send emails.. I just hope the fixed the problems with the past models..not turning on, screen goes blank..etc."
Purchase as Christmas gift for my mom when her kindle early model went kaput.  She loves it and its apps and stays connected.
"only wanted an e-reader but bought the 'fire' rather than a kindle e-reader because the display was so much clearer and easier on my eyes.  disappointing feature is that the font size choices are either too big or too small without anything in between, would be nice to have a just right.  it's also a pain in the ass to turn the 'fire' on and off because the button is flush with case."
"Perfect size, easy to use, battery life is good. Overall worth the amazon &#34;prime day&#34; deal"
I love it and didn't wait long for delivery. This is my 3rd kindle.
"Great display.  Sound is first-rate.  Plays a very diverse range of formats.  Pretty compact and really pretty darn affordable relative to Apple products. One disappointing discovery:  the display mirroring that Amazon touts isn't included with this unit.  When I bought a Fire Stick, I thought I'd be able to send my display to my TV for web browsing and well, anything.  On this unit, you're limited to mirroring Amazon content like Prime videos. Nothing in the comparison charts explains this, so you only find out AFTER you buy the unit that the menu you're looking for isn't there because this device in not Miracast-ready.  Disappointing."
"the kindle works fine,  I just  lost all the games and books in the cloud when I changed kindles  I am not very happy about that<br />."
My daughter has an iPad mini and the Kindle Fire HD 7  does just about everything it does for a portion of the price.
I use it everyday.  I like all the apps it comes with.  The color and sound is wonderful.  I have lots of music to listen to books to read and games to play.  I hardly use my laptop anymore.  I am also a Prime member so I enjoy all the free music.  I recently ordered one for my mom.  She has paperwhite kindle but was very interested in the Fire HD 7.  Best Birthday present ever!
"I purchased the Fire 7 in July 2015 as a temp option after my laptop suddenly died.  Bottom line:  Ideal for eReading and basic web browsing, but not adequate for heavy typing or work related tasks.  See the details below.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy and light.<br />-Great sound quality.<br />-Long battery life.<br />-Responsive touch screen.<br />-Reading View option reduces web page distractions.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Silk browser constantly flickers, freezes and crashes. (Solved by downloading Chrome, which was not easy, but instructions are online.)<br />-Constant ads on Fire home screen. (Solvable by paying &#34;opt-out fee&#34; (~$15) via Amazon.)<br />-Touch screen keyboard is horrible, with crowded letters that cause typos. (Solved by buying wireless keyboard ($20) and wireless mouse ($15).)<br />-One (1) micro SD slot and no USB port. So, no charging and using mouse at the same time (Partially solved by buying micro SD/USB adaptor ($5).)<br />-Not MS Office friendly. I need a much larger screen for composing docs and the current MS capabilities for editing. (Partially solved by downloading free copycat apps for Andriod.)"
"love the size, color and feel.  Getting a case soon"
I love my kindle and I love the fact that it has a camera!  This made it possible for me to take pics of my newborn son when he was born and I was in the hospital with him!  I highly recommend it!
Love it!
"It's so easy to use and light weight, I love it!"
I enjoy using this product very much
"There are NO instructions on how to load apps, help desk etc.  Going to be a long hard sell, unless someone in my family can set this device up!!  I received it as a gift, without any knowledge of the Fire.  Sooooooo, until I get it in place, its just ok."
Met our expectations...good purchase
"my daughter has a ipad and husband has a tablet but its big...like 10in big. I felt left out so I got this one on Prime Day and I have gotta say it was the best purchase I have made all year.  its super easy to use, I can download anything on it, and I love the camera. takes great pics!<br />For the price you cant beat a better Tablet!"
This Kindle had only 8 gigabytes. I purchased during Amazon's Primeday/garage sale. I am returning it for one with a larger hard drive.
I didn't get any extra snything
"The functionality is great, but the speakers are awful! I got an audiobook and can't hear it even in a quiet room with the volume all the way up."
"I have an iPad for work but I wanted something for personal use.  I purchased the Kindle on Prime Day so it was a decent deal.  After using an iPad for so long, I am finding the Kindle to be lacking in some areas.  The battery life is awful.  I have to charge it every day, even with minimal use.  It freezes about once a day and I need to reboot it to get it to work again.  I do find it is better for reading than the iPad and the volume seems louder as well."
This is my third Kindle.  The other two are still going strong.  Actually just bought this one due to the low price offered on Prime Day.
"As a piece of hardware, the tablet is very good for the price, but the software restrictions negate a lot of the value. It's an Android device with a camera, yet you can not take a photo and use it as wallpaper or lockscreen even having paid the premium for the ad-free version. Worse is the fact any content you own through Google Play Store is cannot be used on the Kindle Fire. Having been an Android phone user for years, I own a lot of content I can install and run on all of my Android devices except this one. It's a pretty cynical marketing ploy which makes the device feel less-than-premium. I understand the device is sold near or below cost with amazon looking to turn a profit thru sale of content, but i would much rather have had the option to pay a little more for the ability to use all my Android apps and content just like I paid more for the ad-free version. This type of restriction is a major reason the Fire phone failed."
"Wish there was an option for 3 &1/2 stars.. This isn't the best, nor worst electronic I've ever used.. I was very excited about getting this new Kindle, unfortunately it glitches quite a bit! The Fire HD 7 screen has slow response times and it freezes on too frequent of an occasion for my liking.. I only use this tablet for reading and watching shows on Amazon Prime, it's definitely not good for anything more than that.. The original Kindle Fire was better!"
"This item is fantastic!  I got it for my granddaughter because she is always asking to use my Kindle.  Now I think I should update my Kindle , as well!!"
Got it as a birthday gift and I love it.
Love it!!!
I love these!
"I LOVE it! So far, my new Fire HD 7 has done everything that I've needed it to do."
"This tablet kicks butt!!! If speed is your need ya got it here. And talk about verifiability, you need years to try out everything this beast can give you."
good performance but I don't like the on/off switch and charger over to the side
"the fire hd-7 does everything I need it or want it to do.  I am one, who doesn't need 10 million apps.  it's nice to have a tablet to check emails, watch amazon prime on."
"I had a chance to play with the Fire HD 7 this weekend and loved it.  I was able to watch videos from Amazon Prime and was excited.  Then I had a little trouble with a &#34;locked&#34; screen or something last evening.  I think I need to read the documentation on the Fire to better understand how it works to know what happened.  Maybe it was a normal function of the device I am unaware of yet.<br /><br />Anyway, I am excited to get familiar with it to enjoy it."
easy to use and view
Works well.different format than the iPhone I had prior but after a short time of use it is nice.
It's nice to have a tablet around. It lags and freezes constantly though and the screen shuts off a few seconds after playing any video. Difficult to navigate also.
Simply love it!
"I had wanted the Fire HD 7 since it came out.  I have the 1st generation Fire and love it very much but the HD 7 has so many different features I just longed for it.  Then came Prime Day!  I could finally afford the Fire HD 7 and justify buying it because of the great price.  I'm happy, happy, happy!"
love it. :-)
"Best table ever, easy to use can read or play even with the lights of. I play game, stay in contact with e-mail and facebook , do research for facts on the net and share pictures with long distance friends. Its my mini-computer. I love it Absolutely the best."
"I use my kindle for reading, games,local and national news."
Great product for the price!
I'm on my second Fire.  Can't imagine life without it.
"well, I love it, got it on &#34;prime day&#34; and got such a great deal that even if I didn't love it, couldn't have beat the price.  I was always a &#34;real book&#34; person but now I have come around.. Plus, with internet access and all of the fun stuff to do on the kindle, why not... A lot cheaper than doing so many of those things on my expensive phone and a heck of a lot cheaper than a lap top too."
Love it
"I like the Fire 7, i bought it when amazon had the July sale. The only unit left was an 8 gb unit, since I have multiple phones and computers I made a dumb assumption that I could order a storage upgrade from 8 to 16g. when searching I could not find any ref to storage so I went to the user forum where it was clear what you buy is it, no upgrades. I am disappointed, while is great while I have nothing on it I don't know what problems are ahead with limited storage and now way to resolve except buy another which I will not do. I think if it was clear on the description, not upgrades, it would have been on me, but I see no reference to this limitation."
"A real POS....freezes constantly, very unresponsive a lot of the time.  I will be returning it.as soon as possible.  I paid 80 bucks for it on sale...still not worth the aggravation."
Battery dies too fast but overall functional tablet for light use.
Excellent unit it works perfect.thank you.
I really like my Fire HD 7 even though I still have lots to learn. It's a great product.
"very good , I like it and it is a good companion for my Fire phone."
I have been very satisfied with my product so far.
"Love this kindle, keeps my kids entertained on planes, and me reading!"
"This is not my first Kindle Fire. The last one died after only one year of use. It was never mishandled or dropped. It simply stopped working. These things are too inexpensive to warrant repair so that was the end of that. I told myself at the time I would not buy another, but my one year old iPad just malfunctioned! That's right. After a year, the headset receptacle failed, and it is more expensive to repair than it is to buy a Kindle Fire, so here I am again with a new one. For the money, it is fair to say the Kindle Fire is a reasonable purchase. I won't go into packaging and other factors that are irrelevant to watching media. Let me start by saying the icons and other information on the screen is way too small for me to read without a magnifying glass. Admittedly, my old eyes are not what they were, but really, this is an avoidable problem Amazon. The data on the screen should be easily readable even by me, by going to &#34;Settings.&#34; Except there is no &#34;Settings.&#34; Secondly, when you power on the device, a pop-up add appears. I didn't buy a Kindle Fire so I would be forced to look at adds for diapers and women's vaginal cream. I want to see a nice clean screen. The Amazon logo would be okay, or a view of mountain peaks perhaps... Thirdly, a list of  options is stretched across the top of the home screen in small print and below that, are a series of icons. This is not intuitive arrangement and does not flow cognitively. Come on Amazon, find a better means of presentation. I looked at the apps on the Kindle Fire, and it's apparent I'm not through with the iPad. Many of the apps on iPad are not available on the Kindle Fire even though they are free. All this being said, picture quality is very good, and so is sound quality, the two main factors is judging the value of device. I have Amazon Prime, a wonderful service offering countless free movies and TV shows, including Amazon exclusives like House of Cards, and I can find old black and white movies on Amazon too, not available on Netflix for instance, like In Harm's Way, with John Wayne. All in all, I give the Kindle Fire three stars. This will change however, if my current Kindle Fire dies as soon as the last one did. Stay tuned.n Amazon too, not available on Netflix for instance, like In Harm's Way, with John Wayne. All in all, I give the Kindle Fire three stars.

Nice tablet. Hate the battery life and camera.
Great tablet
Love my kindle!
The battery doesn't hold the charge as long as I thought it would.  It also takes a very long time to charge.
It was exactly as described. I very happy with my purchase.
MOMMY LOVES IT
Does what I want at a good pricem
I love it
"I think I like this product but there were some very frustrating moments for me learning to use it.  Amazon should not assume ( you know what they say- assumptions makes an a--out of you and me)  that everyone is techno advanced and for those who aren't - well the so called manual leaves a lot to be desired.  First you need to go online to get to the manual- but there are no directions on how to get your device on line- I managed that and got to the short, not very helpful manual.  But here was my first big stumper- I wanted to send a message on Facebook but could not figure out how to make a space between words in my messages.  I examined the keyboard carefully, had my husband look at it, kept playing with it, could not figure it out. Read the short manual several times but there was not one word about spacing and not much else about the keyboard symbols and their use.  I thought I would search help- but guess what when my typing ran the words together in the search box it couldn't return any results.  During this process I found out that if you hit the mike symbol on the keyboard you can speak into the kindle and it tries to type your words into the box.  But it didn't do a good job of interpreting my words- more about that in a minute- and I had no luck finding my answer.  I tried going online and looking up the answer but no one seemed to have the right answer- at least for this model.  Finally- just by luck - I found out that to make a space between words when using the keyboard YOU TOUCH THE BLANK AREA ON THE BOTTOM OF THE KEYBOARD.  I guess thats much like a regular keyboard on a computer and maybe I'm dumb - but I was not the only person asking that question on line!<br /><br />Please Amazon revise your manual to briefly describe keyboard symbols and how to operate the keyboard.  In fact revise your whole manual so that even the person with the least tech skills can learn to use the Kindle fire easily.  For many people this low priced and - nice- device is their first  excursion to tablet type devices.  One more example - I want to learn how to use the 2 cameras- but there are no directions in the manual.<br /><br />Now back to the speech to text thing. Its barely mentioned in the manual - no tips on how to use it.  So how do you remove a word that isn't the word you spoke?  I spoke slowly and distinctly but still had errors.  I had to go out of mike mode back to typing- use the error key to remove the word - then back to mic mode - wasn't worth the effort.  I also turned off the suggested word and auto-correct features because they made a mess out of my texts.  Now I understand why some of my friends have such awful texts- if they use voice to text or let autocorrect &#34;help&#34; them.  You can turn off those things by going to apps, then keyboard( I think) .<br /><br />I still haven't figured out some things I think I can do on the device but I'll keep trying as the manual isn't very helpful.  The other thing I don't like I that the battery life is awful- a couple hours of use even with minimal internet use - on a full battery is all you will get.  And I followed the advice on extending battery life which is in the manual somewhere.  And when it charges the charger gets very hot- which worries me a bit.  And there's no light to let you know when its fully charged.<br /><br />Ok the nice things- the pictures are crisp- I bought this so I could see color photos and charts in things I read.  You can adjust the back lighting and even the background color. The screen is large enough for web browsing.  Its not much heavier than my kindle paper white and holds more data.  The silk web browser seems ok - I like goggle chrome- but I won't be on line much with the device anyway.  The sound is fairly good and being able to play music is a feature the old kindle didn't have. I have only had it a few days.  I think I will like it even more when I learn all the things I can do with the device and the price was great.  I gave it4 stars because it probably is a good deal for the price but I just wish there was a better manual- maybe a print one- and that everyone like me could quickly know how to use the thing.  And the battery life isn't good - but I think it goes with that type of device."
I've not done a lot on It yet but what I have I like it
"This is the third Kindle I've owned and I really like it. I also own a Lenovo tablet, so it's been interesting comparing the features/functions. I love how it has a backlight, so I can read it in the dark. Unfortunately that means that I had to sacrifice my wonderful matte screen, so it's much harder to read it in bright locations. That's not a major issue since I mostly use it at night. It's easy to install apps, although there's a limit to what apps can be installed (what do you mean I can't put Instagram on it?!) but the amazon store has a huge variety. I kind of like the carousal on the main screen, but find it a little annoying when I am switching between games, books, and music because it can get filled up pretty fast and then I have to scroll to find what I'm looking for. I tend to prefer to have the icons displayed on the screen so that I can quickly switch between items. I also wish they had a Home button because sometimes it's difficult to get the screen to cooperate when playing games. Overall, I really like this model and love the large screen."
"I have an iPhone and a Galaxy now I have an iPad and a Fire.  I prefer my Apple products, but the Fire is nicer than the kindle paper white. M"
LOVE IT
I love it so far. I didn't realize there is so much extra you can do on it. I have used Facebook and Netflix. Wonderful asset while traveling 😊
My wife wanted the 6&#34; and I got the 7&#34;.  I am pleased with the 7&#34;.  Wish we had gotten two of the 7&#34; Kindles or at least gotten the paperwhite version of the 6&#34;.
"Zero stars. I have an Amazon Prime account and this is the worst thing I've ever purchased from them. I bought it as a gift for my wife and it only makes her upset. First, the zoom feature, which works on any other device I've used flawlessly, gets jammed up and won't zoom back out. Making the touchscreen keyboard malfunction and the content impossible to read. This was enough to bring her too tears while trying to reply to an email today. Second, the web browser is the worst and Amazon's lame appstore gives no options. The default internet web browser, Silk, will make your life hell if you want to surf the web. Slow, pages won't load, and strange errors that come and go until you give up. Third, is that the appstore is awful. The apps are all rated low, function poorly and are extremely limited. Even when there is a app with a name that you know, like YouTube, the logo is always weird and off and the app won't function as it should. I would recommend buying any tablet out there other than the Fire. The worst."
Heavy. Runs too much junk with connections tenuous at best. Difficult to navigate. Battery depletes quickly even with little use. Apps respond slowly.  No backspace correction . Settings confusing by giving too much detail .
"I bought this tablet for my son and he has had it just over a year.  The device started having problems just a few months after we bought it, with it constantly rebooting.  I contacted Amazon about the issue and they sent me another device as there seemed to be a hardware problem.  Now after just one year since their replacement device arrived it is now failing again.  This time the device will no longer stay on, even when charged at 100%, the only way to use the device is to plug it into the charger, otherwise it just turns off and will not start back up.  I contacted Amazon once again about the issue, however they said it was outside the warranty (by 30 days) and they would give me a new one for the low price of 170 dollars (apparently a discount from what they said).  I declined however as I'm worried about spending more money on a device that fails often and will only last a year.  I have owned numerous tablets both Galaxy and Apple and they continue to work year after year, so why this device is so fragile is beyond me.  My six year old son is not pleased with the results either.  I'll have to research another option for him in the near future."
"This is a nice device - very solid, looks nice, performs well.  I just wish Amazon wouldn't be so ruthless in locking out Google apps - which is the reason for the 3 star rating.  I understand the competitive reasons for do that, but think they'd sell a lot more of these if it was more flexible and amenable to all the Android apps out there."
"Its awesome, fast, and runs very smooth not choppy at all."
"I like it! Way better than expected - I give it to my two little ones so they can read books, play apps and watch videos on Amazon Prime. Very happy we made this purchase :)"
"My son loves this. I tried to get him to trade for mine, but he said NO!"
"I apologize in advance for the length of this review; I feel that it is necessary. You can check my other reviews and note that I rate fairly and honestly and that I have been a faithful Amazon customer for many years. I had purchased a Kindle several years back when they were new and eBooks were just coming into vogue. I liked the device (though at the time I was disappointed that Kindle books were often more expensive than paperback versions) and quickly adapted to using it. Unfortunately the screen went berserk and that was the end of that. I continued to purchase Kindle books using my computer to read them because I had been converted to eBooks; however, that does not mean that I had been converted to Kindle devices. That experience with the Kindle device had soured me on Amazon's reader. I like dependable tools and that Kindle failed in that respect. Fast forward to last October and my mother-in-law's diagnosis with terminal brain cancer (she was soon restricted to hospital and nursing home care). To keep her involved in photos and videos of daily family life we purchased a Kindle Fire for her. It was a great way to share photos, books, etc. with her and the Fire performed well for her until she passed on three months later. My wife has used that Fire since then. Fast forward four months later to when my wife purchased a Fire for me even though I had declined purchasing one several times previously when they came on sale at Amazon. I had failed to tell her that I did not trust Amazon's electronic devices [sorry Amazon, great retailer as you are, I do not trust your Kindle devices). I have used it sparingly, mainly because I had become accustomed to using my PC to read Kindle books. The novelty of the reader was diminished because of my first experience with a Kindle reader. Fast forward two months to now: my Kindle Fire HD 7 will not turn on and will not charge. Yes, yes, I have tried every online Google-search remedy (and the charger works on the other Fire).NOTHING works. The magical 20 seconds, 30 seconds, press the On button after, before, and during charging. Wiggle the charging plug gently. Nada, zilch, zero, NOTHING. I even turned around three times with my eyes shut and spit three times. Anybody want an expensive flat paperweight? Anyhow, I have read the many complaints posted here about this device. I have also read the many complaints about Amazon's poor response and support for those many customers who have been maligned by Amazon via this device. I am going to contact Amazon about this. I will post the results. Meanwhile, I do not recommend that you purchase ANY Kindle device. This is not only because of my experience with this device, but because, like other products that I have purchased that are made in China, it is a roll of the dice to learn whether the item received is the result of good quality control or of poor quality control. I avoid Chinese products because I have found them to be unreliable (in one case, the item never arrived and neither did the replacement for it).  UPDATE:  Amazon responded very quickly--before I had the opportunity to call them! The day following my review Amazon contacted us and initiated forwarding another Fire.  I received the another Fire (thank you Amazon) and it is working well. Excellent service from Amazon!"
I like this just as much is my wife's iPad mini. This cost $120 less though.
It's fine for what it is.  It is not an iPad by any stretch of the imagination.  I can see it being used in the living room while watching TV.  I somehow thought it would be a little bigger.  Books display nicely.  Amazon video seems to play well.  No Java support but most tablets lack that anyway. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had played with it prior to purchase.  It is a good device for the price.
I think the picture is so good it looks really pixelated. The sound is pretty good. Alittle fuzzy. The battery life sucks. That's the one thing I don't like. Over all it's pretty good.
Great Product As Expected
"Read the review elsewhere about the difficulty some have connecting their device to their wireless internet.  I can connect at my place of employment, but not in my own home.  Tried all the fixes short of buying a new modem.  For a device that keeps most of its content in the cloud, internet connection problems are a BIG deal."
"So I purchased this on Prime day about a week ago. I really love this Kindle its easy to use, not too big and bulky like my IPad it is just perfect for my books. The main reason why I did not rate this 5 star is because my Kindle keeps rebooting itself every few pages. Called Amazon after some troubleshooting steps they are sending me out a replacement. I do hope this one is better because I really like the Tablet."
Gave my mom my older color kindle.  I love my new one!!!
"Awesome device. It's for ME, not my kids, not my wife - MINE! This way I can maximize the memory utilization and get the most out of it.<br /><br />I wish it had page animation for reading."
"I Thought I Would Be Able To Put In An SD Card To Transfer My Data, Pictures And Music. I Also Bought Mine The Same Day As My Mom And Her Fire Has Been Nothing But Trouble. She constantly Gets An Authentication Problem Every Time She Tries Connecting To Wifi. My Only Hope Is That My Brother Has One And He Says His Is Great. Hopefully He Will Be Able To Redeem The Purchases We Have Made."
"I just received my Kindle Fire and I want to make sure to let other customers what this device has to offer.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />1-It's very friendly and easy to use.<br />2-Light weight.<br />3-It's very fast.<br />4-I got it for $85 *deal special* Amazon Prime Day.<br /><br />What I dislike:<br />1-The inter-phase is not pretty at all, I get the adds and I don't mind but the Fire OS does not support wallpapers or removing the carousel which I do believe is not necessary.<br />2-Amazon App Store is very limited, for example: It doesn't support an Instagram I can't download the gmail app etc..<br />3-It's a basic tablet.<br />4-Camera quality is very low.<br />5- I bought 8GB storage but apparently I can only use 4GB....<br /><br />I do believe this would be an amazing tablet for Kids or someone who just use the tablet for entertainment, not to take to class or business."
"As my previous kindles, I am thrilled with it. Got this one for the front and rear camera.This will make it easier to travel with it."
I have not put it down since recieving it as a birthday gift! This is my second Kindle I love the fact I have so many books at my disposal
Loved it
"I should not give one star and this is why: This is my 4th kindle and they seem not to last a year.If I buy something new and it's not been a year why should they send me a  refurbished one.You know why? Because it's a scam.I see the newer ones they come out with and they are probably better.I can barely use the one I am on now because you have to keep it on the charger.Because if you don't it will just shut down and a lot more. You can pause a video and it literally will start up by itself a few minutes later without touching it. It pauses, freezes, and it's a pain in the butt because you have to keep it connected to charger at ALL TIMES! But to be honest the trouble it takes to get a new one is not worth it. The customer service from amazon has been terrible with trying to correct this issue. I just assume I will have to get a different brand in a few months when I can save for it. Waste Of Money Don't Buy."
yes it met my expectation it is great PS I have to admit Amazon do have great customer service I wish I could do my food shopping to Amazon
Great Price and delivered earlier than expected!!
I am beyond pleased with my Fire! It's wonderful to read on and I really enjoy using it for email and the other basics like social media and watching videos.
"I like the Kindles because they are so much less expensive than the iPads, but I'm so used to apple products, it was a little hard for me to adjust to at first."
A bit different than my original kindle but so far it's fine. All my books and appts transferred but the apps are a bit different.
perfect
This is the first tablet I've had and I love it!!!
Waste of money. Silk browser is is like using a browser from 5 years ago. And biggest scam is the advertisements you are constantly bombarded with when you turn on device. If I wanted to see advertisements I dont need to pay $100 to do it. I can simply turn on the television. Don't waste your money on a fire. Spend it on a better device and be glad you wont be having to watch commercials at startup. Ill stay with my basic amazon reader from 4 years ago that functions much better with the browser and has no annoying commercials. I tried to use it for over a month and hated it more by the day.
"I purchased this for my five year old daughter after doing much research.  She and I love the Kindle Fire for her and the Freetime app has so many books, apps, and videos for 4.99/mth.  I don't use it myself, but as far as I'm concerned, this is the best tablet for a child, my daughter loves downloading games, so I would buy the 32gb if I had to do again because the Freetime takes up a lot of space."
Fast shipping. Easy for my kids to use. Lots of great apps!
"I am taking off 1 star from a pretty much &#34;exactly as advertised&#34; product. Minus one for being a little misled on the one feature I thought this product had --- Miracast. It's the ability to mirror your screen to your Miracast enabled TV or Firestick. Apparently, that's only available on the HDX, not the HD Kindles. For the HD they can stream the movies you have on your screen, but ONLY IF THE VIDEOS CAME FROM AMAZON PRIME VIDEO. You cannot pull video from your personal library, then stream from your tablet.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good durable tablet, albeit with a crippled version of the Android device. Yes, I said, &#34;crippled&#34;, not enhanced or modified. In Amazon's zest for stamping their brand and services on the device, they have created a platform that is a prison disguised as a shopping mall."

"love my Kindle Fire HD--It came quickly and I have been using it every day --love all the different features--I can read books, download apps, and listen to music--LOVE IT"
Got this for my husband and he is thrilled. Happy to be done with his Nexus 7 (2012) that was frequently having issues. Every time there was an update he complained and finally admitted that he would be happier with a Kindle Fire do less fragmentation and &#34;bugs&#34;.
"If there werent ads on my lock screen, I'd be much happier."
"Love my new Fire, much lighter in weight which I love.  The colors are vibrant and clear.  Very pleased with my purchase."
"Hey Amazon,<br /><br />I'm so frustrated, angry and sad at the same time. I bought this tablet on June 12 and TODAY. It just stop working. I was using my tablet last night, reading and tweeting stuff for a while before going to sleep. When I finished, set my alarm clock and went to sleep. (90% charge at that time).<br />Next morning I checked my device to read the newspaper for like 15 - 20 minutes and the battery was at 74%. I went to work and got home (8 hrs passed) And when I took my kindle didnt want to turn on. So, I believe it was 0% and charge it right away. 2 hours has passed and nothing comes up. Tried to connect the USB cord to my laptop for a while and again, NOTHING.<br /><br />First time buying a tablet, first time purchasing product by you guys and had this wonderful surprise!<br /><br />As I mentioned, I'm not going to buy this again (or any related product like this). Send me a new one or money back. Sorry.<br /><br />By the way; I've never dropped my tablet (I bought a protection cover with it when I purchased it)"
Very happy and much easier to set up then my previous tablet.  Still learning about it...but so easy to navigate...I love it!
daughter loves it.
Great picture and the sound is so much better than my old version 1 Fire.
It states 8 gigs of internal but it only has 3.5 gigs when you turn it on and  started for the first time.  Comes with a 2 gig RAM but by the time you begin using it is only running on 150 megabytes. Very limited options for the use of Google's apps. Great starter tablet and the kids love it .
"It was okay, but I had to reload everything.  All items I wanted were in my cloud but when I tried to move them to my home page they didn't work and they went into a&#34;collection&#34;, whatever that is.  I had to delete everything and reload.  Otherwise, it works okay, so far."
"What a JOKE!!!!!!!  Have had this product about 6 mos.  Was purchased as a Christmas gift.  It will not charge and will not turn on and when you try to contact Kindle Fire support, you are connected with representatives who are in the Philippines who do not speak English.  I have always recommended Amazon and have been a very good customer.  This is absolutely ridiculous and not at all acceptable.  We had also purchased the extended warranty but its still under the &#34;manufacturer warranty&#34; but too bad no one speaks English to address any concerns.  Absolutely disgusted and will never get another one"
I was more than happy with this product.
Fairly intuitive to use!
Awesome!!
I just love it!!
I like it a lot  except I would have liked to have rec'd. an instruction booklet.  Graphics are excellent!!
Love it.
No problems with this Kindle. It is awesome just like the other kindles available.
"This is an incredible tablet for such a low price. It is fast, easy to use, and very affordable."
"Phenomenal, love kindles, live reading on them and watching Netflix on them. Thanks amazon for that awesome deal 😘😘"
Just what I was looking for.
"It says 8g of memory, but really there is less than 5 useable gigs on it."
Wish i could change the background but for the price I couldn't  be more happy with my new tablet.
Its awesome so far.
Not enough memory<br />Changing wireless connection is big problem
"I brought this for my son 8th birthday back in February, he as well as I loved it. It was stolen from church back in June, so needless to say he only had it for 4 months. My son was and still is so hurt, but all in all this tablet is awesome."
Good purchase so far it has everything you will want from a tablet. I got it for 60% off during prime day. I wish you can download apps from google play but it is still ok.
This is everything I hoped it would be and more.  I love being able to have my books and internet all in one device.
Love it
"This was my first real tablet purchase and I was extremely impressed with the ease of use and the quality of the product.  The screen quality and sound quality were both impressive for the size.  When doing quick research or checking messaging updates, I reach for the little Fire HD 7 instead of my computer now.  A very cool little product with lots of cool features and apps that steal my time."
I love it as much as my first kindle the only thing is that it feels a lot cheaper. My other one was heavy and well built. This one feels like if I set it down too hard it will break.
"I was looking for a good everyday tablet to replace cheaper Android products I have previously owned. I am very satisfied with the speed and app options offered by the Fire HD7. I was pleased to see that front and back facing cameras were included. The screen is very responsive and the on-screen keyboard very useable. The battery life is good, but not exceptional, as is the nature of these tablets in general. For the money it lives up to its advertising."
"It was out of stock, so took close to 2 weeks for delivery. Defeated the purpose of PRIME....<br /><br />Why does every app require billing address? As long as I am signed in with valid credentials, it should be fine. Why are you forcing me to have the address for every free app download?"
Love it!!!
Excellent Product
Kindles are the best for the price period
I love it!! It's exactly what I will need.
My grandson loves it.  Very easy to use.
I like to read and it is great for that.
"The product page says it enhances Android, and while I do like the UI and smooth integration with Amazon's services it is a crippled device.  Apps from companies are not getting put in the Amazon App Store but they are getting put into the Google Play store.  The problem is that Amazon's Android devices do not have the Google Play store on them, so you can't get the apps unless you jump through hoops to sideload them - but who knows what Amazon will do because you sideload and app and the sideloaded apps won't get auto-updated so you have to keep sideloading updates manually over and over.<br /><br />While I love my Fire TV, and I love Amazon, I currently hate and will be returning the Kindle Fire HD 7.  Here are 5 apps I've found missing so far, and this is just a short part of what is currently a long list:<br /><br />OnStar's RemoteLink<br />Honeywell's Total Connect Comfort (WiFi thermostat app)<br />SleepNumber's SleepIQ<br />Logitech's Harmony (remote control for hub device)<br />Microsoft's Office for Android (OneNote is available, but none of the others are)<br /><br />-----<br />Upgraded from 2 to 3 stars, I found a way to fairly easily get APKs for programs that are in the Google Play store, then installed them using ES File Explorer.  It works, but it's not a great solution since it will have to be manually redone every time there is an update.<br /><br />----<br />Downgraded from 3 to 2 stars, OS 5 is worse than its predecessor and I want to go back.  Some videos that used to work now have screwed up sound and you can't remove things from the home screen anymore.  The 2015 version is cheaper and added an SD slot at least, so it got 3 stars on my review."
Outstanding compared to my first generation  Kendal
"I got this as a present for my wife for our anniversary and she hasn't put it down yet.  The interface is easy and clear.  The picture is very sharp. The only complaint is that the screen is very reflective in bright light, which can be annoying, but is no worse than any tablet.  Over all she loves the thing."
Fantastic purchase from Prime day! Replaces the junk tablet we bought for my daughter.
"I thought it was an excellent product, and I was about to buy another one, until yesterday when my son dropped it by mistake from the couch and it broke. It says that it is more durable than an I pad, however my son dropped the iPad thousand times and it never even scratched.."
Very happy with my purchase!
"Great tablet, but can be a little slow at times and apps will crash."
It's just as I hoped it would be. I especially like the music feature and also the ease in reading my emails.
Love it
"Love this version!!! Much faster, sleeker, lighter, and way more bells and whistles than my old kindle fire"
An android that doesn't have android apps.
"07/30/2015 edit - I have been experiencing different applications auto-closing.  This phenomenon is apparently the ONLY known case.  After being transferred seven times - three via chat and four during a phone conversation - I hung up the phone.  If my kindle keeps auto-closing apps, I will request a refund. The really shotty customer service was a huge let down.<br /><br />I had an older generation kindle so this new one will have a little time getting used to all of the different functions.  Also, not a big fan of the ads. Seriously debating spending the $15 just so I can have a decent picture on my screen."
"I was really excited about my kindle, I bought it during Amazon's prime day so it was only around $80. I like it because I can upload my pictures and game apps on it so I can take them off my phone. Also it's nice to read on and get my email. However, the Amazon appstore does not have all of the apps I want, which is frustrating. Also, the battery life is okay, I wish it lasted a but longer though. Overall, I really like it and would recommend it to those who don't want to send a bunch of money on a tablet."
"I love my Fire.. and a great price, too!"
"While I'm a bit disappointed by the sound,  I'm still going to give this 5 stars for the couple 'unadvertised' features I've found. I'm still tempted to check with CS, as it seemed when I first got it had great sound, and now not so much!  Either that or my ears have gotten worse.  Perhaps it is defective.<br /><br />On to the first MAJOR discovery ... BACK UP & RESTORE!!  Had to do a factory reset on one of my Fire Tablets a year or so ago when an update crashed it.  Yes,  the reset DID get it to work again,  but I lost EVERYTHING, game levels I'd achieved, all my bookmarks, personal files etc.  Not happy.  Though I haven't yet gotten to use it,  this new fire does BACK-UPS! I might give a try before I add too much to it just for the heck of it. Maybe it will give me my sound back. I think this is HUGE.<br /><br />Major discovery NUMBER TWO ... I found this one just this AM. I'd noticed (but not paid much attention to) a little microphone icon that comes up on my keyboard.  This AM I thought I'd see what it does.  VOICE TO TEXT !  And it rocks!  Years ago I remember buying software for my computer that was supposed to do that, it did ... sort of.  It mangled the translations so bad that it took longer to fix it than to type it in the first place. Haven't used it a lot YET,  but this one is awesome.  Most of the translation is perfect other than you have to add caps, punctuation etc.  Far less to fix than UNcorrecting auto corrected text.  This is going to get a LOT of use. Seems to work on any program that accepts text input.  (I've tried 3 so far.)  Love it! Perfect for anyone who hates typing in text on tablet screens,  though multiple people talking to their tablets at the same time might get annoying.  LOL"
"I love this little kindle fire! It's so light and small. I don't know how you did it, but the computing aspect is like fire! It's the fastest machine I've ever used. The book program is outstanding, as is the movie and tv show selection. Thanks, Amazon!"
Great tablet for the price
Far exceeded my expectation.
Returned it. I hate that it's connected to my Amazon account. My 4 year old was able to buy a lot $2.99 apps with out my permission since it was logged in at all times. Doesn't have google play store :(<br /><br />There's no place to insert extra storage micro sd. Not as user friendly as my Samsung galaxy 3.<br /><br />I returned this one and just bought a Samsung galaxy 4. Cost more by has way more positives.
exceeds expectations
Love it!
Love it!!
perfect for me and my use
I am going to keep this item .
It's lightweight and easy to fit in my purse.
"On impulse I purchased another e-eader(I was basically looking for an e-reader). After remembering I have the Kindle app on my phone, I had a &#34;duh&#34; moment. Purchasing the Fire 7&#34; HD Display has proven the best &#34;after- thought&#34; decision I've made.<br /><br />I would highly reccomend this device. Not only is it good for readng, it is also the best tablet for general purposes. A+++"
Love it quality is great
Purchased on Prime Day for just about half off.  Was a better deal to replace than fix my son's fire 6 that he cracked the screen on.
I've only had the new Fire HD 7 for about a week and so far so good. It's much faster than my original first generation Kindle Fire in terms of searching the web and loading apps etc... It is also lighter than my original Kindle Fire. I use it mostly for reading and it works great for that.
Got it for my wife a week ago. She hasn't put it down. I watch ESPN in peace. What else do you need to know?
Nice tablet for my 7 year old son. Great price and versatile
"Fire HD 7, is actually better then the original one I bought. Pictures seems much more clear and it has a camera ....My son loves it!!!!"
"Works well, long battery life"
So easy to use. Great size!
"I got this at over half off with an Amazon deal and couldn't pass it up, but I kind of wish I did. There is a feature called the &#34;carousel&#34; that is annoying to deal with and there is zero customization availability on this device. You might be able to take cute pictures with the crappy camera it has, but you cannot change the background or lock screen without downloading programs that basically wipe the tablet clear of everything. In my opinion that's too much of a hassle to do, but at least I have an e-reader...right?"
I love the new Fire HD 7 but am disappointed that the case I bought for it is horrible and cheap.  I wanted the HD for some time and when the Prime sale was on I was lucky enough to get one.  It was't the color I wanted but what the heck.<br />I just wish that it would be easier to find accessories for it - I've hunted for a screen protector and am so confused I don't know which one to get.  Also on the day of the sale I did not notice that one could get an extended warranty - too late now I guess.  Sigh.  Now all I have to do is work out how to load my books.
Excellent product for us. Bought it primarily as a ereader with wifi capability when needed. Had some issues with it out of the box. We got it set up with our wireless but could not download any apps. Customer service was excellent. They walked us through a reset over the phone and got us on our way. They also sent us a troubleshooting guide.
My second  fire. Love it.
Perfect!
"A head above my over two year old Kindle, this has so many improved features, I am finding something new everyday, LOVE IT."
Loved my first kindle fire gen one and when it stopped working I had to get a new one. I love the upgrades you guys did for the hd and hdx!
"Seems to be working great and definitely a step above my previous kindle. Also, very happy with the price I paid."
Love it
"I love kindle fire, I own one since the first kindle fire but things changed a lot. I did not like HD 7, following are the reasons:<br /><br />1. Operating system is really disappointing. Loading takes too long (3-4 secs while switching the menu like from videos to books) I have an ipad, kindle and ipad are not even comparable.<br />2. Amazon apps. Amazon really few apps, I do not understand why they are not using google play store. I can not find the apps and games I want in the amazon store<br />3. Magazine subscription: I have an economist subscription that includes printed and online membership. I can use web, apple and google play apps but amazon wants me to pay again for economist. It is ridicilous, everything is getting better integrating all platforms but amazon resists that. You can find kindle reader apps for all platforms and read your amazon ebooks but amazon does not let the opposite???<br /><br />I am considering to return the kindle HD 7 since I think I may have more featurescwith a regular tablet."
Love my new Kindle!
This was a gift.  I love it and quickly learned how to use it.  The only suggestion that I have is to make the cord 8 - 10 inches longer.
"I bought this on your &#34;Prime Day&#34; deal. I just LOVE it. Wish I had bought 2 of them. Very easy  to use and does anything I need, books, TV, apps, & the battery lasts much longer than I thought it would. Love it!!"
Love it.  Perfect size.  I'm gonna turn in my Galaxy Note and get a plain text phone and save about $500 a year because this does all the stuff I was using that for.
"Even better than I expected.  It is fast, has so many options and capabilities!"
I'm loving it.
"Love my Kindle Fire HD 7.  Since I am new to using a tablet, this is the perfect starter.  It is easy to use....light weight....and perfect for all of my travels.  I was able to open it and begin using it immediately.  It meets all of my needs and I am very happy with my purchase."
"I absolutely love the Fire, it exceeded my expectations"
Enjoying it!
Love it and so easy to use.  This is the second one that I have
"Runs smoothly enough most of the time, but hardware is lacking for some games. Exactly what we needed though, a cheap tablet to browser and whatnot on."
I love my Kindle. The only thing I would change is being able to choose background and screen savers for the Kindle. Otherwise reading books is now a whole new delight!
Love it. It is my go-to device. Can't find anything wrong with it.
"Clear, vivid graphics"
I read magazines through the Zinio app and this new Kindle will not allow me to download that app.  I have it on my original Kindle that is about 3 years old.
My daughter loves it!
Very pleased with this new Kindle!  It does everything it says
So glad I have it
"This is amazing compared to cheap tablet was using. I've  went through  3 cheap  tablets so got a name brand this time, comes on so much faster than old ones. I'm  ready to go online or pull up my books no tme flat. The screen is beautiful, colors so bright and vivid.  I will say if you don't  like ads pay the little bit more to get rid of them. Wish i had done that now, but they're  not so bad, I  can live with them. I'm  just really enjoying being able to open and get right  into  a book and it not taking  5-10 mins just to get started like old tablet.  Spend the money and get the kindle especially  if you read alot. Avoid  the  cheap  ones and be happier."
"This is my third Kindle and second Kindle Fire HD.  I am getting used to this kindle because it is slightly different than the version that I had for about 3 1/2 years.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a tablet, and isn't into apple products either."
All it was advertised to be
This is a great product!
"The big appeal to me with this Fire was the Prime Day pricing; the deal was too good to pass up! I own a Kindle Paperwhite, and my feeling is that I will continue to use that as my primary e-reader. I've had the Fire for less than a week, and so far I am enjoying being able to stream video, play games, and surf social media on it. The battery life is a disappointment. Graphics are good. I haven't used the camera, because I have an iPhone 6 that is much easier to use for photos. For the money, this was a very good purchase, but it's not the tablet of my dreams."
It is a great tool to have Thanks
This is my fourth kindle and my wife loves it..
this is perfect for watching netflix in bed without having to use my bulky laptop
Just what I wanted
"I like my Kindle Fire a lot. However, I have not found where the total memory is 8 GB. At best, I have found where the &#34;system&#34; memory is about 5.1 GB. Also, the &#34;user' manual is not well done or incomplete. Examples: accessing the weather app did not include the information of adding said app to my kindle.and not all screen icons/messages are not described - e.g. the number displayed by the fire's name."
I received this as a retirement gift and I LOVE it. I had no idea how flexible of a little book sized machine this is!
"I bought this as a second tablet when Amazon was running a special one-day-only $60 sale.  The main reason I wanted it is because I spend a lot of time on airplanes and the ability to download (most) Amazon Prime content for offline viewing was big for me.  The tablet does appear to be a bit under-powered compared to the likes of a Nexus or Samsung tablet, but to use primarily as a video watching device for traveling, it's fantastic.<br /><br />The color was more purple than the name (Cobalt) and pictures would imply, but we put it in a case anyhow, so you don't really see that.<br /><br />I can't say I'm a big fan of Amazon's proprietary version of Android and not being able to add some applications like Google Hangouts or Chrome from the Play store is a bit of a bummer.  But as a device for watching Prime content, it's great."
"Pleased with the new Fire HD..Easy to set up has better battery length than my old one.I have shopped ,played games,read books ,bought apps with ease."
"The Fire HD 7 is small, light and quick. There are a few design flaws I will get into. The first come with the placement of the microphone in regards to the speakers. When using Skype or any app requiring speakers and the microphone to function simultaneously, the microphone will pic up on the sound from the speakers causing terrible distortion, rendering some calls almost impossible. Another design flaw comes with the power button. It is almost right on the charger, and is easy to hit when plugging in/unplugging the tablet. It's a minor annoyance, but I really feel Amazon could have done better. The back of the tablet is slick, but that is easily remedied with a case.<br /><br />Prime video, Netflix, games, and other apps look amazing, The sound is surprisingly crisp. The color is rich, blacks look amazing, and the picture is sharp and clean. All around, this isn't a bad little tablet, but I don't recommend it if you are planning on using Skype without a headset."
I love it and can't believe I did't get one sooner.
"My main complaint is that 8GB is not enough memory to store anything on this Kindle, and you can't add any more memory. Sure it's all on the cloud- your books, your tunes, etc... But what if you don't have constant access to the internet?  You're out of luck. I use the Kindle most when I travel, and the lack of sufficient memory limits what I can enjoy. IMO they shouldn't sell anything smaller than 16GB.  Also, what is with the USB/charging cord?  It barely reaches from the table to the floor, which makes it virtually useless.  It's a full two feet shorter than previous models!!"
"Still learning all the things it can do. Am having a lot of fun with it . Am not very &#34;techy savy&#34; but this will work vey well for me . Love the sound quality ,and the clarity of the colored screen.With the help of my grandkids I'm going to be having a lot more fun with it as I get better acquainted with all of it's features. Have a kindle reader and decided to upgrade."
Enjoying it very much
"Own 6 of them, (am a teacher) great for the classroom computerized math program."
"Purchased for my 78 year old dad for Father's Day. Having not really ever played around on a touch screen before, this took some getting used to. However, it is in his hand all the time now! He enjoys reading on it, keeping up with news and social media stuff, and watching shows on it. It is a good tablet and easy to use."
Amazing product love the way it protects the kindle
"Handles beautifully. Functions smoothly, no hesitation when switching between different tabs. The sound is great quality for its size, and true hd picture. When Kindle Fire first came out, I bought an Accell knockoff and it was horrible. Love this!!"
"The display is crystal clear, sound is adequate, browser seems to be slow but streaming is fine. Battery life not so good, especially compared to my Kindle Paperwhite. All in all, I do enjoy having it but it's a novelty and not meant for productivity."
Arrived early. Great parental controls and separate profiles for kids. Does everything we need.
This was son's second Kindle. First one was dropped out of my wife's vehicle when the door was opened. A distance of about 2ft. Screen shattered. I was a bit more proactive with this one and bought a nice protective case for it. Didn't help. Within 3 months the screen was shattered while he was playing in his bedroom. Don't fall for the false advertising in the TV commercials. These things are not durable at all.
"My daughters love it!  They saved up their money until they could purchase a tablet and this was (we hope) the best bang for their buck.  We opted not to pay the extra $15 to remove the screensaver ads and that has been worth it - they only appear until you swipe and enter your passcode anyway (and $15 is a lot to my daughters).  Putting on parental controls was easy and searching through the available apps for purchase was easy (and making it so that no one can purchase anything without a password was easy).  So far we've been very, very pleased."
Great
"first -- this is my first tablet. bought this on July 15th super &#34;better than black Friday sale&#34; during a &#34;lightning  quick sale&#34; for $79. I think that's a good deal. Pros-- Very clear colorful and sharp screen. Movies play very well, and the sound is good. Speed and construction are also good. Would have given it 5 stars if.......<br />Cons---No Google play store.  Advertised description of product is deceptive. Read carefully. You cannot do screen mirroring, and I have already have all the gadgets on my big screen which accepts all my smart phones and laptop. Also Amazon says the feature &#34;second screen&#34; will only work on a tv with there products installed. I finally figured this all out after carefully reading ALL the &#34;fine print&#34; from amazon support pages.  HERE'S my biggest complaint, I tried chat mode with Amazon with my Questions . 45 minutes later with no favorable results. In closing, for the price, I'd buy it again and recommend. Having no second screen and screen mirroring is not a deal breaker for me .<br />UPDATE!!<br />Amazon has updated the product description clarifying its screen mirroring capabilities!0 AM PDT Tony&Linda Scarfato: I'm also not getting screen mirroring from pulldown menu on display and sounds 08:00 AM PDT Gowtham: My name is Gowtham.

I love this kindle. I'm still learning with it but it is great.
"It's great fpr reading books and e-mail. I just can't figure out how to get the books off the Fire but keep in the cloud and also, to download Prime Free books once a month. It also seems to shut off too quickly when I'm trying to do something other than read books."
"Love my Kindle it's a great little tablet and way nicer than the Samsung I had. Not as fast as my iPad Air 2 but will smoke over 50% of the tablets I've seen out here. The iPad cost almost 10 times as much and it's no where's near 10 times better! The quality and feel of the Kindle Fire are superb. I have not had my Kindle lock up one time, which I can't say for the iPad.  For the money the Kindle fire is a lot better deal and I would recommend one to anybody looking for a quality tablet. That is especially true if you're in Amazon prime member.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate the Kindle Fire HD 7 an 8.5. And if you consider the value it would rated 10."
"My Kindle Fire won't hold a charge, even when it is turned off.  I can charge it until it says 100% charged and turn it off. I may not use it for a couple days and the next time I turn it on it says 1% charged. I have a regular Kindle and have never had any problems.  I am very disappointed with the Kindle Fire."
Love it..
So far I am not impressed. it is not intuitive and keeps losing my place in books.
A brilliant replacement for the 1st gen kindle fire I had. And oh the sound quality! Four thumbs up.
"Getting started and adding new apps, I liked my original Kindle but this is so much better.  Thanks for the great deal."
Item arrived two weeks late
"I love this Kindle Fire. The programs are working great, keyboard is wonderful, and charge working. The only issue I am excepting in plugging the charge into the kindle is difficult. I ordered another charger plug line for this Kindle fire and it is not working great either.  Hope all things will work out."
I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Finally my very own Fire HD. I don't have to share especially since my husband and son have had their own Kindles for the past year. It is pretty versatile and convenient.
Device failed after 6 months. Amazon seems to be making disposable tablets. I don't see the quality in this product. I do not recommend!!
"It is a great tablet from a functional standpoint. Downloads apps, keeps track of my books, checks email, watching movies, it does it all.<br /><br />But the battery life is terrible. My girlfriend has an iPad mini which gets almost double the battery life. Granted, the iPad is more expensive, but it isn't worth having a tablet if you can't use it for a couple hours without needing a charge.<br /><br />I'm returning it and buying an iPad mini. Bummer, I got a good deal on this, but the cheap price doesn't make up for the pathetic battery life. If Amazon fixes that, they'll have a viable alternative that undercuts the iPad in price."
This Fire HD is very swell
"great item, great visual effects"
"Perfect size with great capabilities for users of any age. I have an iPad that was mysteriously taken over by my children, so I bought them the Fire, which they love. Having the Amazon Prime membership is great in conjunction with having a Fire as well to take advantage of the Prime perks. Highly recommended!"
My daughter loves her new Kindle!
love my new kindle. meets all of expectations.
Love it!!! I upgraded and am so happy I did!  I use it everyday.
Good for price
I love it! Good view reading on the beach!
"Disappointed, too slow and not very versital."
"Cheap made, Even marked no promotions or recommendations constanly popping ads.  Sound is tin and terrible.<br />Can't keep wifi signal, keep having to sign in to my home wifi. I have Dell Venue and it is so much better, sound<br />good and even getting kindle books easier then Amazon's own Kindle.  Do not recommend.  Got it on July Black<br />Friday deal so keepng as spare when my venue battery charging or would be returning.  Just plain cheap overall<br />and not even user friendly compared to kindle book use on my Dell Venue 7 android."
"Only wanted a tablet to watch movies/TV shows on airplanes so I couldn't convince myself to buy an iPad for $300/plus.  Saw the Fire HD on the Prime Day sale and, with the $20 Prime Now coupon, got this little baby for $59 (and received it at my office at 8:15 a.m. the same day).  A little heavier than the mini iPad, and the screen isn't as big, but it was $200 CHEAPER!  And I can download Amazon Instant Video for plane trips so overall, it's a win-win."
It's  nice.
"This is an upgrade to first edition Kindle Fire.  This is lighter, excellent camera and fully capable tablet."
Slow
It was more than expected. Really like that the battery seems to last longer than the early generations.
"My wife loves it, not complicated to use"
"This is my 3rd Kindle Fire. I use mine daily, mostly to read.  I love reading in bed without needing a light source. (I recommend using the &#34;Twilight&#34; App to filter out the UV blue light at night so that it is not harsh on your eyes and you can fall asleep easier. There is also a free dimmer app to control the brightness automatically or you can use the manual controls on the Kindle) I also check my email and surf the web on it, watch prime videos (lots of free ones including TV shows, whole HBO series, movies) on it. My son uses his, also, mostly for reading books. This last one I got on Prime Day for my daughter who is going off to college.<br />I love the quality, it has never  let me down.<br />My only minor complaint on my older version was that the power button was hard to see-so I put a tiny dab of pink nail polish on it. But this newer version has a raised power button so it's not an issue.<br /> I have an apple computer and I have even bought an I-pad but I took it back. I really don't need it since I use my laptop at home, smart phone when I'm out. And for the price, the Kindle is just right for me and is so seamless with the free Prime offerings. (I was pleasantly surprised to learn that when I joined Prime, I could put up to 4 additional family members on my membership with me for free, so they get all the great perks of free shipping, free books, free videos etc. My parents absolutely love it)<br />If you are new to Kindle books, there is a free Kindle app you can put on your computer or phone so any book you are reading on your Kindle you can get it on your computer or phone, and it picks up where you left off, very cool.<br />It's great for travel; I take all my books on vacation and I can also watch the free videos that I  download before my trip while on the plane or in the car. You would need wi-fi to download new ones.<br />If you like free stuff like me, one more place to get free and/or very cheep kindle books is a website called  BookBub &#60;info@bookbub.com&#62;"
"The Kindle Fire makes for a great reading tablet, which is the reason I purchased it.<br /><br />  Let me start this off by saying what I enjoy about it.  I actually enjoy the size of it and feel of it.  I also own an Ipad 2, which was my first purchase a few years ago, but that was actually cumbersome to carry around.  The fire feels to be the perfect blend of an Ipad and a smartphone, which is exactly what I wanted.  Now for the operating system, it feels clean and streamlined. I think for a novice, it would be simple to use, while complex enough to be modified by someone more experience.<br /><br />  There are a few things that upset me about the HD7.  First off, let me say I love personalizing the things I own.  The lock screen on the default OS is not customizable if you wish not to root(a.k.a break into the operating system and load your own... possible to brick/break it also) your tablet.  The default lockscreen also displays ads to you.  Now this isn't a game breaker as this is a lockscreen, but I would have expected it to be changeable.  Another thing was when I started using it, I would have my battery drain in sleep mode.  I was able to fix that problem by googling battery drain for the HD7, but if you are like me.. you won't always have a charger nearby.. (sidenote: The battery life is great since the drain has been resolved)<br /><br />  Overall I am glad I purchased the Fire HD7.  At ~$140 I was wary to spend that on another tablet, but I felt the Primeday discount made it hard to pass up.  For what it's worth.. if I had to buy this again, even at full price, I wouldn't mind it one bit."
"It is OK, I ordered it because I thought it Mirrored with my fire stick(which I love)but it doesn't, so I returned it.My older KIndle(2013) does as much as the new. Why have 2?"
"Still learning the abilities of this device, but so far...I love it!!!!"
"This Kindle is very good. Hardware works perfectly. But when I  plug it to my HDTV I can't turn off the Kindle's display, so both displays are on. -1 star for that... Oh and if you use it too much, be prepared to stay plugged to the  outlet."
Great
I love it and am still learning more of what it can do
This is the first Fire HD 7 I HAVE PURCHASED & I LOVE THE 7&#34; DISPLAY.
Amazing.... simply amazing
love it
LOVE the Fire HD! Easy to use & a great price.
Love it!
Very Cool toy . I am enjoying it very much .
I love it
"This is first Fire HD ;8 GB.  Arrived safe, on time as usual.  Little change from past units, but love it.  Thanks again"
Very easy to use. Only complaint doesn't hold charge like my Kindle did. Must charge almost every night. Nice having every thing on one electronic item.
So worth the money!! Love it and all it can do.
It's great
I like it.
Good product.
"This is my third kindle.  I have one, one for my grandson and one now for my husband.  I just love them.  This was a super good deal on a product that I love.  Thanks."
"For the 8gb model, the amount of actual storage for apps you will have is roughly around 4 gbs, the actual quality of the tablet is fantastic, feels very solid, though the battery or display are nothing special, its a very powerful tablet for the price you are paying.  If you are wanting to get the 8gb tablet, just upgrade to the 16gb version so have more space for apps.  At times, if an android user, you will miss the google play store, but again the price of the tablet is amazing and hard to beat.  I haven't had any issues with games lagging as well.  This tablet would of gotten 5 star's but only having 4 usable gbs of the 8gbs on this tablet is no fun."
The unit itself is great.  This is our 3rd kindle - the 1st 2 both stopped charging after only a year or so because of the flimsy connector.  Got a good deal on this so tried again but it will be the last one if it doesn't last longer than the others.  Also - these belong to a teenager - a very careful teenager but still - a teenager.
Frt
Like it a lot
Love my kindle!!!
Beautiful.  And holds a charge.  Excellent for viewing streaming video.  Very pleased with my purchase.
I had an old Kindle and this kind is really an improvement!  Love it!!  Much easier to use with touch screen.
"This is a marvelous product and far more versatile than I had expected. One can do virtually anything on this device that can be done on a tablet that costs much more. Such a bargain! However, I do find that it locks up occasionally, which is mildly irritating."
Much lighter than the original hd fire. Great deal too.
Purchased as a gift for my Mom. She loves it!
Awesome
Love it
This fire is great! Easy to use and fast.
Beware: Operating system is not Android and many (I'm talking a lot) Google Play apps are not compatible. The screen freezes and the unit has to be restarted more than I would expect a days old to be.
It works just as I expected it to. Fast
"Love the ease of reading, but with the light the battery doesn't last long.  I also like viewing the book jackets in color.  Miss the dictionary for looking up words as I read, or haven't found it yet.  Also haven't figured out how to navigate the book yet.  Would  have liked a few more directions about how to use.  Dont plan  to download much because I dont want to use up battery!"
Love it! I love that it has two cameras. I love the different color options. It's very sturdy feeling (doesn't feel cheep) bettery life is pretty good. It's fairly user friendly. Reading books is nice on here.
"It is a great tablet that is convenient in many different situations but I wish that they had more main stream apps in the app store cause a lot of the games and/or apps I want to download are unavailable sich as Instagram, YouTube ect."
Super easy set up and the ease of use makes this a great reader and multi function tab for any user.
I am good to go.....learning more and  more
I love it! I will be buying at least 1 more soon. Thanks Amazon!
I love my kindle fire . My son has one who is 4 who plays his games and books on here. And I got myself one to read at night . I love it
Love it. Got in on Amazon Prime Day for 79.99!
"on sale, it's a fine if limited tablet to supplement the other computers and devices I have.  good wi-fi, plays my amazon music, shows my kindle books, gets my email, the Silk browser is OK on most of the sites I visit, takes good photos."
Having trouble figuring out how to download Prime books and music.
I LOVE KINDLE.....we are a KINDLE family.....I highly recommend this product!!!!
Great product for the kids. Dropped a few times. And not even a scratch. Does everything you need. A+
"As an avid Kindle Fire user, I'm pleased with the Prime Day Deal that was offered on this Kindle Fire and yes, It met my expectations...now to wait for the sale on the latest 8.9 inch HDX Fire..."
Love my new Kindle. This is my 4th Kindle and I love all of the updates on the latest generation. I watch Netflix and do a ton of reading so it is perfect.
Perfect gift I will be buying another soon
Very nice and clear screen for reading.
"I love my new Fire HD 7.  It seems lighter and thinner than my old one.  Love the camera.  I can take selfies, video, and regular pictures.  I really like the document feature.  I got it at a good price too."
Everything I was hopping for.
Perfect size for reading books and surfing the net.
Pleasantly surprised!  Wish I had gotten more for family.
We love it.  The picture on the screen is good and big enough to comfortably watch videos and movies/shows.  Light weight and easily portable.  Good for reading in just about any light as the screen doesn't glare.
love it. clear and easy. only issue is the battery doesn't last as long as my original kindle fire.
"The only thing I don't really care for is, the fact you cannot set any pictures as your background. Your lock screen is advertisements for apps or products on Amazon."
great device
I bought the Kindle HD 7 for my grandkids aged 16-10 to replace some old kindles. They like the speed it has in loading & operating their games. They also enjoy using the camera.
It's the Amazon version. No matter what you want you get the Amazon screen that asks you to buy something.....nothing buy ads to start with
Nice for surfing and of course if you want to pay the yearly membership you can enjoy alot of the free perks. Other than that  lag is a little when surfing round or downloading which the hdx version should eliminate that because of the better processor.
I like everything about the fire hd 7 except it doesn't hold charge long enough
Perfect for my Mom. She loves it! Thank you!
"Works great, does exactly what I need it to do - check email, store .doc formatted notes, read books, watch movies and listen to music. Runs just great!"
"I was invited to begin this review by rating the Fire HD, which is the only reason it has even one star. I currently use a Nexus 7, and I'm going to continue using it. The Fire HD is cheap, flimsy and continuously locks up, but that's not the worst thing about it. Amazon has gone to great lengths with the Fire to keep you constrained within the Amazon family of apps. I use the Chrome browser across all my devices. To use Chrome on my Fire I had to go online to find out how. Then I had to install 3rd party software on the  Fire, and install Chrome using that software. I acquire most of my apps from the Play store, and while there is probably some way to install the Play store app on the Fire, I didn't bother to discover it because I've given up on the Fire HD.<br /><br />I bought Amazon's product, and they expressed their gratitude by trying to put me in a virtual prison cell. They've created a product that attempts to restrict you to &#34;Amazon approved&#34; products. I'm sorry, but I wanted a tablet not a parent. When I bought my Nexus two years ago it came with the Google apps preinstalled. No attempt was made to restrict me to Google apps. I'm free to install any Android OS app from any source. I'm so irritated by my experience with the Fire HD that it's actually tarnished my opinion of Google, since the Fire OS is a proprietary version of the Android OS.<br /><br />If you are considering purchasing a Fire HD, or any Fire product, don't do it. Spend a pittance more and get the Nexus 7. Mine is about two years old and still serving me well. I use it everyday, including for reading books I buy through the Kindle app. See what I mean? My Nexus hasn't tried to restrict me to the Play Books app.<br /><br />SHAME ON AMAZON! SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!"
I am not certain about this  fire 7 HD - the battery has run down completely on several occasions  overnight.  I will keep trying to check it but it may have to be returned.  Other than the battery issue there is the silly promo material that constantly appears which only makes you angry and not included to buy particularly since being a prime member you would think Amazon would do better by their membership.  I have an original Fire which still works and the battery does not run down.  Very happy with that one.  This one seems like a nice enough product other than the battery and ads.  so we will see - not inclined to give it more than 3 at this time
Works great
This is the second fire HD 7 i have got there great
Should be more TV series for free like Netflix
Great product.
Love my Kindle Fire!
"I love it.  It is light weight, easy to use,  portable, and convenient.  I have not been on desktop since receiving this gift.  It is perfect!"
"I bought as new in November 2014,but when the screen broke AND iI took it to be fixed,i found it was made in 2013  and there were no parts available. This was a gross misreprensentation and I think  I should receive what I paid for,a new 2015 Fire. Mary E. Grove<br />megrove77@gmail.com"
"This is a definite improvement from my two or three year old Fire. It runs so smoothly, and is sleek and nice. I haven't yet tried everything, but what I have is great.It will be nice to use the rear facing camera. That was a bummer with the old one, only having the front one. The only thing is that I thought the battery life had been improved with this version, but so far I can't see a difference. Otherwise, it's a great device!"
I had a Kindle for a few years till it was accidentally broke.  Tried other Android device and hated it!  My husband bought me another Kindle and I am back in the clouds ;)
"So far, so good. Loving my new Kindle Fire--the display is amazing! I'm still discovering all the bells and whistles--I've had a first generation Fire since they first came out, so the new one has a bit of a learning curve for me."
Awesome! Better than the iPad!
Love it!
I just think that it's a great device for everything.
This replacement for my older Kindle is much lighter and has a sharp clear screen.
Love this new Kindle.  Works great
Really like the screen clarity compared to first Kindle. Delivery was on time and set up was easy.
Great product and price
"Just the right size to keep with me, love the sound quality, movies come up quickly to watch."
My review is for Garon from may 22nd review - what does your picture have to do with a kindle fire review?
"I was lucky enough to purchase this on Amazon's Prime Member day for half off. It's exactly what I wanted when traveling. I was able to play games, read my books, check emails and keep in touch on Facebook. It's has performed beautifully despite the fact I am in an area where I barely get internet reception. A definite keeper!!"
Great size screen for me...best for reading in portrait ...similar to typical paperback.  Easy to carry & keep at hand.
"wish it came with a instruction book. like how to delete books, share books"
Quite an improvement over my older Kindle.  Screen is beautiful - much faster.
So far it is fine.  I am still learning how to use it.
"We purchased this for our 7 yr old.  He loves it.  We love the parental control as well as the variety of games and learning apps available.  He plays, learns,  reads and even watches movies with the limits we set.  It's great!"
Just received it a few days ago will review it later thank you
Excellent
"I love the size, travels well.  Easy to read, down load books and games. Easy to go in and out of my e-mails,  Facebook and books.<br />Buying books on Amazon and borrowing from the library couldn't easier.  Get one."
The device seem to have a bug... audible stops and the volume lowers on its own and or when I open an app
Love the Kindle Fire also got a great deal.
Slow response
Love it so far! Very easy to use.  I like it better than my Samsung tablet.
Great
"Was not familiar with operation, thought would be more like a regular android tablet"
"clear image, nice size for my use"
So far I really like this. Upgraded from mine that was about 3 years old. I wish I could get weight watchers app though. I would but this again.
"I love my Kindle even more than I thought I would! Initially, I purchased my Fire HD just for on the go access to my ebooks and digital comics (side-loaded ComicRack works like a charm). However, the more I've used it the more uses I've found for it. In addition to just reading,I now regularly use it for note taking, remote desktop functions for work and of course playing games. The screen is fantastic,my graphic novels look amazing and the touch screen responds really well, which is a big step up from my android tablet that I paid the same price for.<br /><br />The only drawback is not being able to add storage space. The 16 GB model leaves you around 12 GB of usable space."
I love it. I was a little  sad to find out that you have no way to add storage but i am happy with the cloud the screen is very big and clear the device is easy to learn and fun to use so many applications to download i found Jurassic  park love it awesome. I wish we got more free books to borrow each month like three per month would be nice not just one. Money tight cant swing another bill for unlimited.
"This is our 4th kindle in a family of five. We love them. They are cheaper than iPads and have so much more to offer. They are all linked and we share music, movies, books, games and more."
absolutely love this version!
We had an old one that got droopped and these replaceed it and it is as expected.
Love the Kindle Fire!  Very easy to use.
"I have only had my fire for 2 days, but I love it. It works great, easy to navigate, easy to read."
"I had to replace my  old Kindle due to a recharging issue but this one is just as good.  I do not find it as user friendly and some of the features I do not like but need to figure out if I can disable them.  Otherwise, it is good any recommend it"
Disappointed that Amazon charges 15 USD to get rid of the sponsored ads ! The product while functional is not really exceptional and has very plastic feel. The performance is just OK. The number of apps is limited as well.
not too big or too small. easy on the eyes.
so easy to use luv it
Easy to use out of the box. Lightweight and lots of fun for the kids.
I love it
"I now have the  iPad and the Fire HD 7 and I love them both . The Fire HD7 , was purchased as a backup devise to handle my storage limitations with my iPad . The  Fire Hd  has exceeded my expecations . I have only one regret and that is when I had the chance to buy the Fire HD 8 that I did not purchase it .. The Fire HD7 is an outstanding devise that will put a smile on your face every time you have the chance to use it ..!!"
I ordered 2 but one came in 2 days...and still waiting for the other one...suppose to come Aug. 6/7. Don't understand when I bought them at the same time...still a great product
Works great
Great product!
"I got one of these for each of my kids.  I love the parental controls, they are so easy to set."
"Super value, meets our fire HDX, it's. AMAZON ing"
Very happy with my new kindle!
Slow functions. Returned.
Great tablet.
Excellent for the price. Very happy with my purchase.
"This is such an upgrade compared to my previous version. My last Kindle Fire HD crashed and crashed hard (it took 12 hours to charge, wouldn't hold a charge, then eventually wouldn't turn on). I debated for about a month which kindle I was going to get. I almost got the Voyage but I am super glad I decided to go with this one. The battery lasts day (even when I read for hours at a time everyday). The display is crisp and I love the option of the color backs. A+ kindle! Would definitely recommend."
nice little table  came fast easy to use.  Would recomend to anyone.t
The display is sharper than previous kindle.<br />It keeps stalling out and has to be shut down and restarted.  Concerned about quality on this one.
Love it. Have purchesed several. Just dont stay charged very long.
Best thing is ability to download prime movies which I can watch at the gym without going on their unsecured network. Screen is a little too small bit for the money it is an absolute bargain. Buy it!
Completely satisfied with this Kindle Fire.
"I have had 2 surgical procedures within a 3 week period and it has become my absolute best friend, now that I am bedridden. I was surprised that the so called &#34;Amazon Prime Day&#34; did not have a better selection of products I would be interested in."
Bought this for my wife and she loves it. She's on it all the time so it's probably very reliable.
So far I have found the kindle fire hd 7 easy to use. I still haven't used the audio but so far this device has met my needs. I also feel it will be a great addition to my classroom to help my struggling readers improve their reading.
Awesome for the low Prime price of $84.00. Everybody must check out Amazon's daily deals.
"Fire would be a big replace for my console if  was able to buy app only for the  Fire that are mature for my age please add more game like INJUSTICES , for the old 25 year old kids."
Love it!  So much improved from my other two Kindles.
Love it!
"Love,love, love it.  Easy to use even for a &#34;non-tech&#34; savvy individual like me."
"Great product. If you're looking for a tablet with simple needs and wants, this is definitely a good choice.  Given, I got it on sale, but even at the price it is, on deal or not, it is a great choice. Always needs some improvement; the camera could definitely use an upgrade.  The app store could allow some products - instagram for example - to be free, but that may just be my prejudice since Im a bit android, and thus a google play, fan.<br /><br />Like i said, it can always use improvement, but it does still allow free netflix, pandora, and facebook.  Plus the music stations are plentiful and pleases me enough - not to even mentioning the quality of it's instant stream videos (even though that could always use an expansion.) Games could add a few classics for free, since I'm not a fan of angry birds, temple run, etc I like my minesweaper, snake, poker, and such (24 but still a little old school.)<br /><br />Overall, like I said, it's a great tablet and easily a good choice for the simple &#34;portable computer&#34; needs.  Even the web browser is decent and still allows you to use google search; I was a bit worried when I first opened it up and it used the Bing search engine haha. \<br /><br />It doesn't match the range of abilities an android tablet allows, but it is still a good choice when it comes to an affordable and very useful product"
"Got a great price, delivered on time, excellent tablelt!"
"This was a gift I received from my mother after the previous Fire experienced an unusual error where the toolbars disappeared. It's a slightly smaller screen and wider thickness than the previous Kindle, but I don't mind it that much. I used my previous tablet on an daily basis so having a new one up and running is great. It seems to be a bit quicker than the previous model, but the battery feels like it doesn't hold out as long. It runs all apps with no drama and I CAN SEE MY TOOLBARS AGAIN!"
"Kindle did not last six months, device will not charge, even though I purchased  a new charger. I am not happy , miss my kindle. Spoke to kindle personell, says will cost $50 to fix.  I feel since the device is not even a year old, I should not have to psy"
I upgraded from the fire 2 and I love the size most of all. I know I could of purchased the 3 but I wanted to hold out for better specs and that's what I got. Happy customer.
I like the Fire with one exception; you can't turn off or disable the carousel and that is incredibly annoying. Navigation of the Fire is simple; there's no need to have that annoying carousel right in the center of my home screen.
Its was a gift for my son and he loves it! He didnt even notice that its not what he asked for...which was a Ds.
"Easy to use, great resolution, fast, lightweight. Good buy."
Perfect
Very convenient
"Very pleased with the Fire HD7.  It is durable, has great sound for such a small unit, the screen is sharp, and it performs flawlessly. Very easy to set up and customize. I am mainly using it for streaming videos, listening to music and reading. I do not intend to use it as a laptop substitute, but in a pinch I can see myself doing so. The silk browser is nice, but again I won't be surfing with this unit too often. I am very old school and still prefer a desktop over a laptop, tablet or phone for productivity. But as an entertainment unit this is perfect, especially with Amazon's Prime music option to stream music online or listen to your playlists offline, and the same holds true with with Prime videos...watch online or off line. In all, I am very happy with the item. Nothing negative to ay about it."
"I love how useful it is when I just need something to toss in my purse and just go. Don't get me wrong, I still love reading my hardbacks, but I do love the convenience that the Kindle gives me at a moments notice. Battery is not half bad either!"
"Great tablet for the price I paid, I picked mine up at the local Meijer for $85. Great for watching movies, books, and going on the internet ."
Excellent value!
Nice present for my 6 yearold
So in love!!
"**** UPDATE -- This review was originally sent by my 11 year old son w/o my knowledge.<br />His Kindle is great, Amazon customer service was great and replaced our two defective versions immediately.<br />His internet is locked which is why he couldn't download any new games. haha... Parental controls are great!<br /><br />****** Frustrated 11 year old's review (internet locked) ******<br />I thought it was amazing when I first got it but before that I had to return 2 I reapet TWO kindels before I got a good one. So it really good and fun and all... only for a few months though.<br /><br />  After a few months my kindle had a log of storage filled onit, and I wanted to get a certain game. So I deleted almost all my games to get it,(because it used a lot of space) and I still couldn't get it.<br /><br />  The weird thing is I only had one game that barely used any storage space  on it so I was like what ever and I tried down loading another game that I deleted to try  to get that game. And it wouldn't dowlnoad! And that was strange, so I checked on my storage and it said that the storage was so filled that the internet wouldn't work. So I deleted a couple things, and the internet was still locked!<br /><br />  So to end my review I have to say that... I only have one game left on it and I can't download anything else on it."
"Every was good. Product, shipping and price"
Love it!
I wish you could customize it better but other than that very good.
The thing constantly shuts off and restarts. I will be watching a show on Amazon prime and it will freeze up and make an obnoxious sound for a few minutes before it finally shuts off and reboots! Sometimes I will be trying to unlock and it will just be frozen. I can't even swipe to unlock it sometimes.
I love my new Kindle
"Great item, great price"
This has been great. I love it. Mine came with a free time limited subscription to the Washington Post (Bezo's owned) - which has also been great!
"if you like the google play store, dont buy it!"
"I bought a tablet at the same time and I don't even use the tablet, the kindle fire is way faster.<br />I love it!"
The lack of expandable memory or internal storage bums me out but other than that it's great.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
Absolutely love it!
Nice little reader.
I found the battery life to be way to short.
"Disappointed.  Video showed ability to watch shows on tv set but did not specify that it only works for shows from prime.  Even with separate firestorm, I can't send netflix from this kindle fire to tv screen. That was a huge part of why I bought this."
Only issue I'm having is the battery life seems to be shorter than my old Kindle. Otherwise loving it!
"Great tablet, very fast for browsing and watching videos. Memory isn't an issue since amazon offers free cloud storage. Wish there was a USB port and the amazon app store had more to offer."
This is my third one. Was not impressed with the earlier versions. This one is really great. Good enough to watch movies!
"Awesome device, good to watch prime videos and audio books!"
only have a few days still learning how to drive it.
👍
Exactly what I wanted.
Excellent picture. Minimal charging time. Tons of apps. The claim of &#34;ready to use out of the box&#34; is absolutely correct. Love it!
Love it. Just wish it came with a manual.
The plastic back makes it seem cheap. Charging power is low.
The Fire HD 7 worked well until it locked up(5 days after purchase). There is no immediate fix for this according to the tech rep to whom I spoke. I was told the device would need to lock up several times before a tech could look at the device's history to hopefully find the problem. A 40 second hold was required to reboot.
Exactly what the cat wanted
Very good
Excellent value
Everything I expected. Navigation is a little clunky but I may get used to it.
I bought this to see how a $79 tablet compared to my very tired iPad three.  So far I am pleased although not blown away.  There have been many transferable apps and what I am missing like Barron's. I ca usually open up in browser. Doesn't appear to be any way of transferring my money magazine subscription. It's at least worth continuing the comparison. Be nice to not have to shell out $600 got a new iPad.
My 8 year old used his birthday money to buy a Kindle Fire at the Prime Day sale.  He loves it!  He is using the Kindle Free Unlumited.
Its just compact and easy to use. Also HD display is awesome
Would of been nice if it came with a wall  charger not just the USB cord
I love it. I'll love it more when I figure out how to use it better
"This kindle is excellent.  Works smoothly,  nice screen, and perfect size.  Very happy with my purchase"
I am enjoying my fire along with my grandkids.
"Loved my last Kindle, Love this one!!"
I love the tablet so far.
good product
good tablet havnt looked back since buying it. I love it.
Love it
"It is great for google, email, audio books and written books.<br />It does not sync with iCal (no surprise)/<br />The one thing I don't like is, it does not have much sound from recordings.<br />I cannot record then label and email the file. I am in a chorus and that is an important activity that apparently I can only do on iTouch or iPad.<br />It is very good value for the money but because of the lack of recording and ability (even with downloaded microphone app) I will buy an iTouch next time."
I love my kindle fire
Bought as a gift for my daughter who loves it!  It was a perfect present for her graduation!
The only ptroblem I have with this is that the battery runs down within an hour. Your sent me a fast charger but that doesn't solve the problem.
"It's crisp and clear. Fast operating system, good for books and  entertainment. The screen seems very reflective but if you get non-reflective screen covers, it somewhat balances out. Overall, it's well worth its money!"
"I bought this on Prime Day as a holiday present for a friend. I know it is great as I own one myself. It can do everything but I know he will use it mainly for reading. That's fine but it is convenient, has a lot of apps and is just super. Love mine a lot and thought hey perfect present at a great price."
"An excellent, versatile, adaptable tablet"
I love the Kindle except I cannot download a Nook app to it.  I had two nooks prior to the purchase of the Kindle and the only way I can access the books is on my laptop.  Not really into reading a book on the computer.  I had a Kindle app on my Nook that I occasionally used and I sure wish that Amazon would permit the Nook app so I could access my 100+ books I already have on my Kindle!
needs to include instructions
Fun tablet
"I'm extremely happy with this product!  I bought it in hopes it would work with a Belkin keyboard, and it does!  I have tapping a screen to type!  I love that this also has a camera!  It functions well on wifi and is easy to handle.  A little odd to get used to after using my phone for everything on the internet, but it's just different, not hard to use.<br /><br />It ended up being exactly what I need.  I'm actually getting more apps now too.  I used to hate the clutter of apps, but I am finding quite a few that come in handy!"
Very easy to use. Nice quality. My daughter loves it!
Somewhat complicated to use. Could be more intuitive.
Full of fun
"Easy to use, great screen quality."
"Bought a second Kindle Fire HD so my daughter and I are not fighting over my first one.  Love it just as much, but wish Amazon still made the origami cover for the newer Fire."
"I had one of the oldest kindles ever like, for a long time I wanted a fire but up until two weeks ago, that was a fantasy, after 6 years of use it died, so I got this fire. So many options and abilities, I just love it! Not only did this enhance my reading experience, it enhanced my mobile gaming, streaming, and searching. Even though it's 7 inches, it's still quite portable. I did have a few problems like when the advertising wouldn't shut off my lock screen, but just emailing amazon customer service fixed everything up in less then 12 hours. If you want to revolutionize your kindle experience from an old kindle without spending an arm and a leg, get the kindle fire HD 7!"
I still have tons to learn but so far I like it a lot. A usb or micro sd slot for extra memory would have been nice.
"I love the fire tablets. I am very much dependent on the Amazon ecosyatem and it provides a great way to access books, movies, apps and shopping.  My complaint is that they should not offer this device in an 8GB version. I downloaded no apps and one movie in lowest quality and the memory was full. They market as 8GB, but out of the box it has only 3GB of storage available for your content!! Unless you are completely fine with streaming everything and have no intent to download anything locally, then spend the extra money on 16GB version."
"The Fire HD may be a fine product if you want a reader with no proper audio jack.  However, make sure you know that Amazon will load this with your account information, including credit card details and a full order history, with no password required.  You'll also get a couple of ads to clear off the screen each time it wakes up.  I'm returning this and buying something else from a company that doesn't presume that I want private information pre-loaded on an easily stolen device, and I'm willing to pay a few bucks more to not have ads."
The Fire HD 7 I received today is not new as it is stated in the product description. It looks like it belonged to a Peyton Deel before me. I contacted Amazon earlier today but no response. Maybe I will get a response after this review.
Love the Kindle. Easy to use.
I love my Kindle Fire! It's easy to use and works even better than the previous version.
LOVE LOVE LOVE MY FIRE HD! And love Amazon kindle even more for replacing mine completely free of charge.
Perfect
I love it.  It loads so much faster than my old one.  It can do so much.  Good purchase for the money.
I could not be happier with my kindle. I also have a (very popular brand) mini and it does the same exact thing with better bank for your buck. It's also easier for my kids to navigate. 5 stars for sure!!
I really like it. It boots up faster than my other tablet
Absolutely love my kindle fire!
I had a Kindle and when it died I purchased the Fire HD.  The resolution is great and I am really enjoying using it.
Awesome!
I love it!  It is so fun and easy to use.  I am still finding out what all it can do.
The best
"It does what I need it to do. Probably more. My 5yo uses it the most, reads books, plays games, watches Netflix and YouTube videos.<br />Back looks like cheap plastic but I like it as it's scratch resistant. Note, resistant, not scratch proof.<br />Screen is sharp, nice resolution and touch responsive.<br />I wish though the speakers were in front vs the back."
"Purchase this on Prime Day.  Was going to send it back.  Rec'd an e-mail from Amazon saying that the first payment was $60.00 and then 4 payments of $19.75 for a total of $139. I called customer service and they refunded me my $60.00. I decided to take it out of the box and register it.  I didn't realize that I had purchased the white one.  I guess I was too excited that it was on sale for $79.00. So far, I've just watched a couple of episodes of a TV show.  The picture quality is great and the sound is good.<br /><br />My only concern so far, is the background cover, the white.  I like to hold the tablet in my hand, instead of in the case.  I wonder how it holds the dirt and oil from the fingers. If I happen to have chocolate or something on my hands and I pick up the tablet. You can wipe it off, which is good, but will it stain?<br /><br />I purchased this because of the price and because I want to take advantage of my Prime Membership. I will only be using it to watch Prime TV Shows, reading and listening to music. After watching 3 maybe 4 episodes, I need to charge the battery.  I just connected it to my laptop and kept going.  I don't think that it was fully charged.  I just took it out the box and set it up.  It's already back in the box.  I haven't decided if I'm going to keep it, but for $79 you can't beat it.  I just wish that I would have gotten the blue, black or the citron."
Love my Kindle Fire!
I love my new Kindle Fire !
I currently own a Kindle so I bought this for my Sister and have downloaded some great books for her to enjoy!  Thank you for offering this at such a great price!  I also got her a purple cover protector to go with it!
"I am enjoying my new Kindle except for the battery life. My old one it would allow me a good charge for up to five days w me doing a good four hours reading ,Facebook , games and email daily but this one it seems I have to charge every eight hours and the only thing I am using on it is the reading app. No Facebook no email no games  it is an issue for me"
"Just like my old kindle, but does not load my music which was the main reason I got it :("
I have a first generation fire and was quite contented. For my birthday I was given a HD fire 7&#34; my word the sound is so rich and clear the visual is very crisp I'm enjoying it totally!
Easy to use
Decent tablet but I hate the excessive amount of ads. And the Amazon app store doesn't have near as many as Google play but on the bright side for me it was extremely durable
Thank god for my kindle I was stuck on the plane for 3 hours and it saved me..
My favorite tablet for now. It sounds like digital studio when used to play music.
I love my new kindle! I can take it places because it's small and compact.
THANK YOU
I have a question
I do love it but I am still learning things it can do.
A++
Met all my expectations and more.
won't download 3rd parties
"Let me first say that I am generally very happy with Amazon, and I have had Kindles since 2010. The problem is that if you avail yourself of the free Kindle book promotions that are constantly happening in addition to your occasional regular ebook purchases, you will amass several thousand in your account. And before long, you could easily have more than 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 or more. Now I'm NOT talking about trying to put all of these books onto the Kindle--it simply won't be able to, nor would I want to. I'm simply talking about having these &#34;purchased&#34; Kindle books in your account, ready to download at your whim. When I got my HD7 16GB last week, I followed all the instructions. So far so good. Until I simply clicked on &#34;Books.&#34; Mistake. It went to the Books--Cloud section and began trying to list all 17,000 or so books in my account. I let this run for several hours. I found that If I clicked on Home while this was running, then it took about 5 minutes (yes, minutes!) for it to change to my Home screen. And this is BEFORE I had downloaded a single book to the unit!<br /><br />So I left it plugged in to the charger overnight and hoped for the best the next day. But there was no improvement after an entire day had passed. Basically, because I have a lot of &#34;purchased&#34; Kindle books in my Amazon account, this Kindle is useless. I have a first original Kindle Fire that I was hoping to upgrade for this one, but sadly, the original Fire outperforms this HD7.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it will probably work just fine for you if you curb your appetite for free Kindle books and keep your total significantly below the 10,000 count. (I don't really know what the count needs to be under for the Kindle to not bog down, so it could even be maybe 5,000?) Again, I really wanted this HD7 to work, but it is apparent that the designers at Amazon are ignoring those of us who have many many purchased Kindle books in our accounts. Not very forward-looking in my opinion, since eventually there will be more and more Kindle customers who will collect very high numbers of Kindle books in their accounts. AGAIN: I'm not talking about downloading these books on the Kindle! I'm simply saying that the Kindle bogs waaaaaaaay down because of the high number of Kindle books that are available in my Amazon account. Kindles need to be designed to accommodate ALL of the customers' accounts, not just those who don't buy very many ebooks."
kindles fire hd 7 is wonderful
"Love it , just hope charging port hangs in there ."
I bought this and the Nabi at the same time for my 2 boys (who are 2 and 3).<br />I have recently returned the Nabi and bought another Kindle fire. I LOVE everything about the kindle! It's so easy to use and the kid mode is perfect! The nabi was very difficult with everything
I love it..
Very happy with my Fire HD 7. Lighter weight than my older Kindle Fire.
Was a gift to my now ex-girlfriend.I'm sure that ungrateful junkie would give it 5 stars.
"The HD7 does everything well for the price, and it was a great bargain on Prime Day. 99% of the people who have complaints did not first research what this tablet can and cannot do. They complain about not having all Google apps available or not being able to personalize the look of the home screen etc. This tablet does everything I'm interested in. I don't need a bunch of apps and games. I just want a device that can surf the net, get email, play music and videos (sound and picture quality are excellent) and store my Kindle books. I plan to leave all my content on the cloud, and only download a book or two at s time. Ditto for videos. I will stream via wifi unless I need a few hours of content for vacations. Granted the 8 GB model doesn't hold much video content, but enough for the two or three times a year I want to download a few TV shows or a couple movies in SD. If you plan to routinely download hours worth of offline content, make sure to buy the 16GB because most of the 8GB model's memory is used by the operating system and preloaded apps that cannot be deleted.<br /><br />For outdoor reading, you need an e-ink reader without a reflective screen, so don't buy this or any other tablet if you primarily plan to read at the beach. I have the basic entry level Kindle for outdoor/indoor reading.<br /><br />I find this model easy to use. It's not hard to figure out. It provides new user tips on the screen and there is a User Guide loaded on the device as well.<br /><br />Mine has the Special Offers on the lock screen. I dont find it objectionable. You can't turn those initial ads off, but in the settings you can turn off ad recommendations and that will eliminate any additional ads elsewhere. Again, know what you're buying so you don't complain later about the ads on the lock screen.<br /><br />I love this tablet. The sound is amazing for a device of this size. The picture quality is great. I bought an inexpensive book-like leatherette cover to protect it and the cover also serves as a means to stand the tablet up in landscape mode so I don't need to hold onto it. Consequently I don't care what color the tablet is. The color barely shows. I highly recommend the HD7. I think it's an amazing product and I'm very satisfied with it."
Works well so far....hopefully it won't just stop working like the first one did. It was hardly used.
I am more than pleased with my tablet.
"I ordered the Fire HD 7 during the Prime Days and it does not work. I've tried pressing and holding the power button as well as quickly pressing the power button. However, nothing works. It simply will not turn on. I charged the device over night and there was no indication that it was charging. Has anyone else had issues?"
What do I say - it's 2015 everyone needs a reader.
It works much better than my old kindle fire
love it
"This is our second kindle fire! It's the 4th generation (October 2014 release model). Our other was the original kindle fire...we had it for three wonderful years. I have to say, I prefer the feel of the original. It seemed to be of better quality. We have a case on it so it's okay, but the internal specs on the new model are a ton better! We love the added camera features. It moves super fast. The apps and games show and perform excellently! Another perk is that it actually comes with the wall charger! The originals did not and I hated that! We are excited to own this awesome device!!!"
Love this tablet. The pictures are so clear. Only negative is I hadn't been able to download the Nook app.
"Love my Kindle Fire,,,awesome...I enjoy reading with both hand free to do other things..."
"The Fire HD 7 is my third Kindle. However I'm not sure I will ever purchase another one. My 7 freezes up all the time. It frequently will not turn to the next page of a book. All in all, I am frustrated! On the plus side the picture quality is over nice. Just wish it worked as nice as my other Kindles."
Brought this for my son. he loves it. on ot all the time.
"Got it for our 20 month old daughter (I know, can't believe it I did it either).  She loves it, easy to use."
"bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it, prefect for a kid to play games take friend photos and look at the photos I upload from where I live, lets us keep in contact and she has fun with it"
"I enjoy the kindle fire line a good bit. I primarily use this device as an easy access to Amazon prime music. Also quick surfing of the web. A bit small for movies, but passable, with a very clear screen."
Picture is great!!  Love that I can watch Time Warner Cable from my tablet.
Very good
hello amazon: i do not have wifi for games is this a problem w/ you and my apt bldg...??
"My previous Fire was much better...this takes longer to update, etc."
this tablet is awesome! I use it all the time and it fits right in my purse! I am so happy with this purchase!
I Love my Kindle 7 HD. I have a KIndle 7 and I love it also.  Great Products..
Love it
"My only complaint is that the tablets don't support google play store, which is a major deal for my children. It doesn't offer a lot of the games they were able to play on their old tablets. I purchased 3 tablets as gifts and 30 day return policy has expired so I'm stuck."
"This is a fast little tablet.  Very nice display, good sound, and holds a decent charge."
Awesome little gadget.  Wished it didn't have so many advertisements on it.  Reminds me of an app.
Love its a great replacement for the Kindle w/keyboard that I had. Color is great and makes it more interesting.
Can not transfer me email addresses to this Kindle. If I had know that would not have purchased it.
"A big improvement over my old tablet, and cost about the same.  Excellent display, can watch movies from Prime in great quality with no buffering."
Good buy-my son loves it!
great
Great screen. Poor battery life.
Awesome
"Love, love , love, can I possibly say more..."
I love my fire hd
"The battery does not hold a charge as long as my old one and for 16g it holds about the same amount of movies, thought is should  have more storage. Otherwise, love it"
"love HD7 - a lot of fun - put off acquiring since I loved my kindle, but should have gotten it sooner"
Easy to use everything I was looking for in a small table.
Love my Kindle Fire
Love it!
"I have lost track of how many Kindles and Fires I have purchased for myself and for gifts. I have been a fan from the start. I bought this on Prime day thinking I would give it to one of the grands that didn't already have one for a birthday present. Everyone seemed to already have enough gadgets already so I thought of sending it back. Then I opened it and registered it and spent the entire day playing with it and now it is officially mine. I have a birthday coming so that helps to justify my greediness, doesn't it?<br />&#34;With Special Offers&#34; Is not at all annoying and does not interfere with anything or make the Fire any less user friendly."
"The screen was smaller than I thought. I measures however, it was not the same way Amazon measures. Overall great product just small."
"Vision and hearing impaired , artheritis and carpal tunnel pain make this item unsuitable for senior citizens !"
EASY TO USE
I'm happy with it
That why I bought a second one for my son
Great!
Like all my Kindles. I do so many different things on them. If you need a tablet I would recommend you try a Kindle.
"I really love my kindle. Easy to use. I can take pictures, listen to music, watch movies, surf the web and read books .. the main reason I bought it."
I love it!!!!# It is exactly everything I wanted and needed and have no complaints. I even received the order on a Sunday which is about!
Great speed and graphics
"After dropping my first one on a tile floor, I replaced it with a white model. I just couldn't be without my Kindle Fire HD. The resolution is amazing and the functionality is great."
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he really loves it! He mainly uses it to browse the web, watch videos, and talk to me through skype. So far it seems to work pretty great."
"Amazon Fire Store won't let you install ad-block on Fire Tablet, and even though this is an Android OS, Amazon has such a tight leash what apps you can install, only from their store. Come on Amazon, it's bad enough Google runs a muck, I've had to fix so many family, friends computers of malware, viruses, because of ads, and them not realizing how much crap gets installed without them knowing what's those apps/ads install.<br /><br />If you like Amazon tracking you surfing and Google shoving ads in ur face from ur history/surfing,<br /><br />If ur going to track, spy on me, you better ask first or pay me, Amazon, Google making cash off yalls surfing, and app use.<br /><br />Be warned....."
"Don't like the ads or what I have seen of the product that a friend has. Wish I had paid more attention on Prime Day since I ordered it from my smartphone (i product) through the Amazon app. In any case, after reading other reviews and looking at a friends version, I have concerns especially since I have a competitor product I have used various versions of since 2009. The negative vibes started with my purchase experience and I am debating cancelling my order but really wanted to explore an Android platform device. Found out that purchases made of IOS apps do NOT transfer to Kindle so will need to reinvest in purchasing my favorite games and of course, will never be able to get to the same levels since many have been played for over 5 years. Oh well."
"Love it....light weight, excellent image quality, fast.  I bought it to read books, but find that I prefer it to my iPad for most things....who would have thought?"
Love the kindle fire
"Mom loves it . Again MY MOTHER can use it , so if you cant then please , please go back to the stone age haha . Seriously though its simple to use , I think its cool too and might buy one for myself eventually . Its well built and the screens got great definition . One note , I would not pay the full price for it , personally if I had to id buy the fire 6 . I got it on a sale though so they were both the same price ."
awesome!!
GREAT
"Bought for my 7 year old grandson.  He reads, plays games. Plus I can buy Kindle books and he can download them."
"Great investment, my daughter loves it!!!"
"Bought on Prime Day to replace my 1st generation Fire HD (2012). Works great except there isn't a micro HDMI port like my old so we could watch on our TV. Hopefully the charger port on this one holds up (the reason why I had to replace my old one is that the charging jack doesn't work),"
"This Kindle was a gift to my sister. She saw the one I have and was so thrilled by it that she wanted a similar one. We are both extremely happy with our kindles :D<br /><br />For us, this is a MUST have device. I myself own five kindles up to date. If you are an avid reader such as myself, I recommend the Kindle Paperwhite or Voyage (Personally I like the Paperwhite more). The paperwhite is WONDERFUL for reading. Really comfortable for the eyes, you can read for HOURS and you don't need to recharge it quite often, very light to carry with you everywhere and you can put thousands of e-books in it.<br /><br />As for the Fire HD 7, this one is a must have too. It is really comfortable to watch movies on it, read, play games and simply surf the net. I like to take either of my kindles with me where ever I go and when travelling? I TAKE THEM BOTH :D"
This one is working great so far. Appreciate all of the Amazon workers for being very helpful and courteous.
Everything it says it is and more!
I returned it within a week...
"Functionally pretty useless. Really glitchy, the bookmarks don't work well for reading. It won't save PDFs that I need to read on the go (at least doesn't make it easy to do so).<br /><br />Worst part? The stupid fu**ing ads that pop up every time I turn it on.<br /><br />Big waste of money."
So much power in such a small package!
I received my Kindle as a gift from my wife. I had a 9&#34; tablet but it was a pretty cheap brand and was prone to needing to be reset frequently. I really enjoy my Kindle Fire 7&#34; I really don't even miss the larger size.
Love it!  So happy I purchased this for myself.
Unit died after only 3 months. Would not recommend!
Pictures and sound are awesome. The internet is very fast.I would recommend this tablet.
Was very pleased would recommend it to everyone
This is my second kindle. I love it. I am so spoiled with the HD display.
What happened to the thirty day trial with the purchase of a kindle? I got charged and there is no way to cancel and get a refund?
Have really enjoyed my Fire HD 7.  It is easy to use and makes reading e-books more enjoyable.
Awesome product and at a great price!
Love it!
"I have 2 kindle fire hd 7. I got one for each kid age 4 and 7. So far my kids love them. I can set up parent controls and limit the time they are able to spend on the kindle. I got the kid free time for them to use with them and so far we are very pleased. There are a ton of kid friendly apps, books and videos. We got the 8gb but we should have probably went with the 16gb. My 7 year old likes to add a lot of apps and they take up a lot of memory. A good note though the apps are extremely easy to remove from the device. Overall we are very pleased with this device."
"Wow...I really love this thing.....size is perfect and I am on it for hours listening to audio books, iheartradio, shopping, and surfing web!!!!"
"I had a Kindle that was one of the originals and opted to upgrade to Fire HD.  I really like the speed and clarity of the Fire, but I miss a couple of games I used to be able to play that seem to be no longer available.  Give me back my UNO!"
"Do not order if you want a port, Kindles do not have them.  They are great for kids and adults.  My children have managed not to break them.  We have several."
Does everything an IPAD would for my purposes and 1/5 of the cost.  Rather disappointed it wouldn't connect overseas.  Pleased overall.
"All I can say at this early point is &#34;so far, so good. In the future, wait until somebody has had the chance to play around with the unit before offering a review. In my case, 2 days is not enough time to offer a true review. Come back to me after an appropriate &#34;burn time&#34; has been met ( 2 weeks, in my eyes)."
love it
Limited applications available.  Battery life shorter than basic Kindle
I like it very much. The absolute only thing different from my HD fire is the camera.
"Awful.  Mine arrived Friday.  Sunday afternoon went to use it and the screen wouldn't change from black.  Followed all the reset instructions and still black screen.  Started a chat with Amazon support.  They kept asking account details etc. and then they would transfer me to someone else.  After the third transfer I asked for a supervisor.  They refused transferred me three more times and then I got a phone call and was told nothing could be done that I hadn't already tried.  So they said to return it.  I don't understand why I was tied up for an hour and a half if they knew it had to be returned.  I had a Nook for years that still works great, but I got caught up in the Amazon Prime Day hype and thought I would try a Kindle Fire.  So this morning I am back to reading my nook.  Don't waste your money.  Take a good look at the Nook before deciding on the Kindle Fire.  Amazon is so big now I guess customer service is gone."
This Kindle HD7 is perfect for my use. I don't have any business or special needs for work so I use it mainly for entertainment and in that area it is  five stars in my book! (Pardon the pun)
"Great product, I bought one for my aunt and one for my niece, they both love it. All though you are limited to Amazon's store. If you're buying for someone more tech savvy then you might be better off with an android tablet that has removable memory and a more thorough selection of apps and such.. But for the price and ease of use this is hands down the best!"
"If Amazon allowed full access to Google Play, I would give the Kindle Fire five stars without hesitation.  But there are so many apps that Amazon doesn't offer, such as YouTube, Google Drive, Google Maps, Chrome, etc.  As a long time Android phone user, I find it very frustrating not to be able to fully integrate my Fire with my phone and PC.  Sure, some apps can be &#34;side loaded&#34;, but we shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />Except for the Google Play issue, I've been well pleased with the product.  For e-book reading, watching Netflix, checking social media, and basic browsing, it has worked flawlessly."
extremly inefficient .. extremly hard to use keyboard .. interphase with other devices too limited .. stick to books and stop advertising to me crap I dont want .. I bought a continuos barage af advertisments
Love it!
"Nothing much to add here. It works right. A few of the typing keyboard buttons have moved a little (frustrating) and the outer buttons and jacks have moved to a more typical smartphone layout (more frustration). Only one charging jack now. But my main concern is the build quality. It FEELS cheap! The fact that's it's thicker tells me they've reduced the cost by building slightly bigger units. I say it's thicker without actually measuring it...it's THAT much thicker! You can tell right away.<br />On the upside, I got it as a lightning deal on &#34;Prime Day&#34; for about half price...so I can't complain.<br />I love all my Kindles...don't get me wrong....I just have a gut feeling about the quality of this latest model."
I like it alot this is my first tablet. So far so good. I like that if I accidentally drop it it won't shatter the glass great for clumsy people like myself. And I just like the size of it.
This tablet was purchased primarily for reading e-books because of its excellent printing format. This is particularly so for readers with impaired  vision. Everything else is a plus!
Waist  your  own  money  on  this  crap
"The day it was delivered, it continuously locked up when tapping APPS.  Contacted Amazon, needed two updates.  It was manufactured 8/2014 and I purchased and received it 7/2015.  Still occasionally freezes up, but for $139. + tax, I can live with it.  First and only headache I had with an Amason purchase.  I trust Amazon so I give more time to evaluate the performance."
My wife loves it with the exception of the battery life
Got the 8 GB by mistake... it is a waste of money.  You have a total of less than 5 GBs to store anything with no way to expand.  To get the benefit of the HD feature you want to download an HD show.  A 43 mins TV show (aka 1 hr no commercials) is 850+ MB. I got a great price for it but after it arrived I quickly realized I would need more space.  Amazon said send it back for a refund and then buy the one with more space at the non-sale price.  Just wanted to exchange and pay the diff.  Oh well.  Live and learn.
My old Kindle bit the dust.  The new one is even better!
It is not as easy to negoiate as my Kindle Fire. I do like the 2 cameras
"Coming from a nexus 7 (replaced due to age) this tablets has many features that are terribly frustrating. Aside from the &#34;special offers,&#34; the functionality and features are very basic. You can't change much of anything, but it does do all the basics very well. Why it doesn't run Android just like all other Android devices is beyond me. Amazon has tried to make a few things their own and just missed the mark. They also use almost half of the total 8 gigs (my model) before it even gets to you...that's far too much. Sometimes I feel like I'm just renting the tablet Amazon. Unless they have another good price on their tablets in the future, I got mine in prime day, I wouldn't buy another."
Battery doesn't last as long as previous Kindle.
Simply amazing. I do nearly all of my interneting with this wonderful device.
"I don't usually do product reviews, but I am very please with this purchase.<br /><br />I had been wanting a tablet for a while now and when the Amazon birthday deals came a long, I was fully considering between getting an iPad or the Fire HD.  I had done my research and weighed my options can found that there are very few distinct differences between the two tablets for what I was wanting. I am a makeup artist and professional dancer and travel a lot between NY and NJ, and wanted a tablet mainly for entertainment purposes. I was able to get the Fire HD for about $80 with the Amazon deal that was going on that day. I have no complaints so far. The only thing is I cannot sync it to iTunes, but I'm ok with that since I have had Amazon Prime for many years now, allowing me access to videos and movie.<br />If you are considering this tablet, get it! It will totally be worth every penny!"
We got this for our 3 year old as a reward for finally being potty trained. He cant put it down. We are very picky with the games and apps he is allowed to play and the controls make it easy to manage. it is super easy to use. He is able to navigate through it in his own. I do not have a bad thing to say about this.
"Spent more time charging it than using it. Dead every time I picked it up. Absolutely junk and no wonder Amazon had such a big sale on these to unload them. Biggest disappointment in an electronic device of my lifetime. I LOVED my cheap old Kindle, which lasted for days on a single charge (i like to read) and unfortunately gave it away. Do not plan to purchase anymore Amazon tablets ever."
"Expectations were just too high.  This isn't anything more than a kindle book reader with a bunch of ads all over the screen making it about as useful for surfing the web or checking email as any other smart phone.  Screen is too small and the software menus use too much real estate.  Very slow email and web browsing performance.  Still good for reading books.  And that's what I'll use it for, but won't try to push it any farther (it just won't go there... even with a big push).  Headed back to the iPad world."
I thought I was going to be able to download movies to watch on trips.  All of my attempts have been unsuccessful. It no different from my older Kindle.
its it great.
gave as gift.
Still learning how to use but so far really Love it
Love this and every kindle i have purchased!  Thank you!
Love reading on my kindle fire
"V happy with the fire HD, however the case was not what I hoped.  I dislike the color and there is not a place to hand hold the computer."
"A major in improvement over my origin Kindle I bought years ago.  The real feature I bought the Fire HD was for the music capability.  But what I didn't expect was the long batter life, which must be 3 or 4 time better than the original Kindle? However, I'm still using my original Kindle daily mostly for games."
Love my new fire had 7! Great customer service !
"Seems a bit laggy but I got it on sale during the Prime day-got it for $79 so really it's amazing. I would give it 5 stars but there are preloaded suggestions right below the app in the carousel that cant be taken off-i was able to change this option on both my 2nd gen kindle fire and my kindle fire 6. But no luck getting rid of those annoying suggestions on this one. That's probably what the &#34;special features&#34; was. Honestly it's not worth not buying it. I paid $59.99 for a NeuTab for my 2 year old which was bottom of the line in tablets, so for me spending an extra $20 to get something that blows it out of the water makes me happy."
Very nice
"This is my 3rd Kindle and it hasn't disappointed me yet!  (Broke the screen in the first one, got melted freeze-pop spilled on the 2nd one.)<br />Overall, I love it!  The absolutely ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5:  WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE MEMORY!!  IT SHOULD NOT ENTAIL SPENDING ANOTHER $100.00 OR MORE JUST TO HAVE MORE SPACE!!  Just sayin...  :)"
It's wonderful! Especially when I need 2 b all around the house!! I'm using it right now 4 this!!!
"This is my 2nd fire unit.  So far they both suck - on the first the OS failed and Amazon did (does?)not have a way to simply reload the OS - ARE YOU KIDDING ME?<br />On my 2nd Fire unit I became suspicious when it said my battery was at about 64,000% charged? Then it just wouldn't take a charge it sometimes worked when plugged in but not always.<br />I want my money back and the cost of all the movies I purchased - DO I HAVE TO CONTACT BEZOS DIRECTLY?"
GREAT
The size of this is handy and easily readable.  Easier to change lighting and other options than the 2nd generation model. Not as happy with the power button or the charger input as the last version.  Find myself having to go over the area several times to get it right.  Could see a future problem with the charger not wanting to grab in.  Was told it would freeze less than the previous version.  I never had the old 1 freeze the first 8 months I owned it.  This has frozen 3 times this first month.<br />I am impressed with the better graphics.  It is very noticeable when looking at pictures.  Still would recommend off brand cover as most that buy this model from Amazon do.
excellent although smaller than I expected
I love it. It is faster than my last one.
Better than the Paperwhite without being as confusing as a &#34;full tablet.&#34;
"Worst tablet in the history of tablets. the app selection is horrible, most school text books are not available. It glitchs constantly. The operating system constantly crashes and many times i have to reset it multiple times just to read a single chapter of any book."
It was a gift for my husband and he loves it.
"This kindle is awesome! I don't quite know why I have waited so long to purchase one, but I'm so glad that I did."
Bought this two months ago. Kept experiencing intermittent problems with it not powering on and now it will not come on at all!  Very disappointed as I have purchased kindles before. Will not purchase again and certainly will not recommend to anyone.
"Have lots of books on my computer. I am unable to connect kindle to any computer. Computers don't recognize it. If rhey do recognize it, I can not load any books, photos or anything else. Can not delete any old books I have downloaded from Amazon."
Love it.  Great having the photo capability.
"So much better than my last model, the on/off button is on top of the Kindle.  My previous Kindle the on/off button was on the back side.  I have a physical handicap and with not much use of my hands, I do everyday tasks by mouth and a mouth-stick.  One other better feature is the camera lens on both sides of the Kindle, now I can take pictures myself."
"LOVE my Fire HD!!! I previously owned a Kndle Fire for three years, but when I could no longer charge the device, I decided to upgrade. What a SIGNIFICANT difference in speed! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!"
"OMG I love this one.  I had an older version and this is faster, lighter, and has many more features."
"I  like it very much! It is a really nice Tablet! I own three KIndle eBooks starting with the original.So I wanted to try the FIre.. The Price was great!! It does pretty much everything you would want..Facebook,<br />email, takes great Photo's easy to post them on FB etc..lots of Games.. books to read .. & much more.I gave it three Stars as I do own an iPad and only that could get Five Stars.."
"For the price it's ok, but the apps limitations and ads will never allow it to be better than just ok."
Does everything it is suppose to do and then a bit more ...  This is my 3rd Kindle ... And while 2nd generation has MUCH BETTER placement of the On/Off/volume buttons these are ok !!
Excellent quality.the screen is absolutely clean. Greatvalue.it took a while to figure out though.
Awesome device.....easy to navigate....received as a gift and love it
"My wife hates most electronic stuff, until I bought her this for Mother's day. Now she is using it every day, and loving it."
"I like it really well so far. A few things that could be improved: There's a microphone, so why don't they let us speak to enter text? I haven't been able to find an app so far that would add this ability to the keyboard. Unlike my first-gen Kindle Fire, you now can ONLY use the period button for periods. You have to switch to the number function to find commas, etc. (You used to hold the period button, then slide over to the comma, etc.) Also, I believe my old Kindle reverted back to letters from the number screen when I entered space, but now I have to push the button to go back. It gets old.<br /><br />Also, my first-gen Kindle Fire had a nice, grippy back so I could hold it without a cover. This one is slippery, not a rubbery finish at all. That's a step backward."
"Not user friendly at all. The carousel is a jumbled mess of recently opened apps and is the main interface between you and the fire. It's extremely frustrating to navigate through. The quick start guide was worthless and there are a lot of annoying facets to this device that you can't figure out unless you click on everything. No matter what you do, Amazon just suggests you can buy something off of prime. It's a giant propaganda machine. I can't be on the tablet for more than 5 minutes without being suggested 100 possible purchases I could make that somehow relate to what I'm doing. Very very frustrating."
very good tablet
"Fire HD7 is just great.handy size,easy to use, the camera is very good.  Sending pics to Family and friends with ease."
Don't know why I didn't get one sooner. Enjoying all aspects of my Fire HD 7.
I use my HD Fire for both work and personal tasks.  Very easy to use and has plenty of functionality.  I really like it.
"Great picture quality, love the unlimited books for my children, and Amazon Prime.... Need I say more!"
"No surprises, this was our second Fire- had to get one for my wife. At our age maybe we could have used a bigger screen, but this little unit is outstanding at what it does and we couldn't be happier with it."
I purchased for my 6 years old.  She down-loaded books & games by herself.  She loves this.
"1 Star for functioning.  2 stars for being cheap.<br /><br />Negative Nancy Stuff:<br />The low screen resolution, sluggish system responsiveness and screen size make this a poor choice for most anyone I can think of.  Screen was not as good as my 3 year old Asus TF700T.  It moved faster than that tablet but only just.  The TF700T is notorious for performance issues often making it unusable and the fact that I had to try and realize the better performance in the Kindle was scary.  As for that size point... I use a Galaxy S6 with a 5.1&#34; screen and that difference in hand just isn't all that noticeable.  Very quickly I wanted to put the HD 7 down and go back to my phone.<br /><br />PROS:<br />If you've never really used anything like this before, want the cheapest simplest way to consume all things amazon and you recently had a family member say your computer or phone was too slow but responded with &#34;I think it's fine&#34;.... go for it.  I got sucked into the Prime Day price point and gave it a shot, but that price is the only real pro I can find.  Still a portal to all the amazing things that Amazon offers!<br /><br />Advice:<br />Unless you have no choice due to cash constraints get the HDX 8.9, hands down."
Like it fine just need to discover a way to operate it. Are there any training or teaching materials out there for me to review and help me get to use and enjoy my I Pad???
Exceeded my expectations by far
Love it
"Better than expected.  I thought it was just going to be a reader for books.  I did not expect Skype, eMail and more."
Great
Every thing is perfect. Setting it up was easy accessing web or movies was a breeze love the apps and found my favorite game I love my kindle fire HD THANKS AMAZON. MICHAEL E BROWN
I love my new Kindle...
"DO NOT BUY!  This device is advertised as durable, however, my 6 year old dropped it from her waist (about 2 feet off the ground) and the screen scattered. We actually purchased 2 of these devices and interestingly enough my 7 year old's device has also shattered.  We contacted Amazon to discuss replacing or repairing the device.  We were told that Amazon does not have a repair center and recommended that we buy another device!!!  The Supervisor explained that &#34;if you watch the commercial closely the device gets redirected by the windshield of the car.&#34;  UNBELIEVABLE!  They weren't even willing to give us a discount on a new device.  Very disappointing!"
This gadget is fantastic.  My only complaint is that I find it difficult to move to footnotes and endnotes.  This was finally cured by procuring a stylus.  Now I have no complaints whatsoever.
Not enough memory. Can only download one book at a time. No games can be downloaded while reading book.
Love it!!!
"I loved my first kindle, this is even better than my first one."
"Bought this for my wife. She loves it, its her third kindle  and  2nd kindle fire the other one still works great. it is just that it is the 1st generation and doesn't have a camera or blue tooth."
great for me
"I'm extremely unhappy with this.  I lost my original gen 1 Kindle Fire so I bought this one.  In less than a month it stopped turning on.  I thought it had run out of batteries, so I plugged it in to charge.  It wouldn't take a charge.  I figured I would report it for replacement with customer service a few days later, and suddenly it turns on.  I use it for a week, and now it won't take a charge again (even though it was at 80% charge) and won't turn on at all.  I really want to like this thing, but I'm just going to cut my losses and go with a Nexus 7."
It is nice and will take time to get use to it.
Since my last Kindle was over 3 years old I decided to replace it with a new one.  I was happy with my old one and I like my new one with all it's newer features. I now use my kindle for most everything instead of my computer.
Everything is great but!!!!!! Off-On switch is too stiff & Battery life<br />not near spec time stated.
Very inconsistent in responsiveness. My other kindles always responded quickly. Often times I have to power off and back on because it seems to get stuck even bringing up a book I already own. Very frustrating!!
I'm sure that this is a nice tablet. I am very slow at electronic devices. And I'm not sure how everything works
We got it for my daughters birthday and she love's it.
"So far, I'm living it!"
Excellent enjoy it alot!
"The Fire HD7 is exactly what I need and enjoy which is why I bought the second one.  However, when it arrived I couldn't make it work.  After an hour and a half with an Amazon Customer Service rep (Mark), we found out this Fire didn't have the latest updates, which required downloading.  It was a frustrating and time consuming process.  I would think Amazon would make sure the brand new product they are selling is up to date.  I had no way, as a consumer, to know why I couldn't get online to even register my new purchase.  Bad form, Amazon.  Good form for hiring Mark, who is a gem."
"I must confess that I have not had sufficient time to appreciate your product. In other words I have not read the information you have provided on how to operate my HD 7, 7&#34;  It is a lot of information to absorb in a short amount of time. Thus far, however I am very pleased with what I've been able to do intuitively. I wish, like a lot of new products you had provided a quick introduction list."
"I would've given it 5 stars, but after attempting to unlock the device,I realized the lock screen was an ad.... and you can't remove the ad without a price. If Amazon had mentioned what exactly was meant with the whole ' includes offers ' thing,I probably would've rethought purchasing it. No wonder it was like $70ish. Overall, it's fast, clear, works great. The only downside for me was the lock screen ads."
Glad I drove over my kindle fire I really can see the improvement in the new HD 7  Thanks
I love my Kindle Fire. I already had a Nook but the Kindle is lighter and the color and definition are so much better than the nook.
"Love my Fire 7 but I do believe there should be an initial tutorial to guide you through the learning curve.  It's bright, works fast and I love the extra benefits as a reader tablet.  It took some trial and error to figure it out but the dictionary feature is awesome.  Press your finger down on a word you don't know, and presto, definitions appear...genius!  Would definitely recommend it.  Amazon includes a month free of Amazon prime...still don't know how to activate it.  No info provided."
"This is an amazing device.  Why three stars instead of five?  When you turn on the Fire HD, special offers are automatically delivered to the device.  Want to turn those off?  Be prepared to pay $15 US for that apparent privilege, Amazon claiming that the advertising subsidizes the cost of the device.  This fact is presented as a purchasing option, which I missed the first time. I find this to be a bit of nickel-and-diming.   Note:  I updated this review, softening my ad criticism, and changed from 3 stars to 4."
Love it!!
Good product.
planning a vaction where i hope this come in handy
"This is a review for the 4th generation (2014) Kindle Fire HD 7, 16 gb tablet, in black.  I'll explain things about the Fire HD that are not apparent.  First, Amazon uses &#34;years&#34; for its &#34;generations.&#34;  Even though there only are three HD Fires, the current one (Oct 2014 to present) is the 4th generation.  2011 is the 1st generation, 2012 is 2nd, 2013 is 3rd, and 2014 is the 4th.  Each generation's tablet is somewhat different from its predecessor.  If you buy generic accessories, make sure that it is right for your tablet's &#34;generation.&#34;  I hope this explanation helps, because I was not aware of this right away.  Once I received this, I went online to the Amazon Fire HD page, to read all about it.  There are many very handy features.  For example, I can set up a separate profile for my child, but he has access to whichever Amazon apps I have bought.  I can restrict which apps are used.  I also can restrict the hours of the day that the tablet may be used, and whether he must complete educational apps before he can use those for entertainment only.  I think this feature is wonderful!  There are many online resources to teach you tips and tricks for using your Fire HD, and I recommend reading them.  They will tell you how to make the most of your tablet, without &#34;rooting&#34; it.  To &#34;root&#34; a tablet will void all warranties.  While this may be a great way to get the most out of your cell phone, it really is not a great benefit for the Fire HD.  The main benefit of having a Fire HD is to make the most of your Amazon experience.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can stream your Instant Video easily.  You can integrate all your Amazon apps across your Kindle devices, etc.  The main CON:  you cannot download Google apps to this tablet.  Yes, there are some ways around this, and you can read about them on the internet, but you will NOT be able to download paid apps, or to have your content update and share through Google.  That said, for the most complete experience, simply use Google apps on your phone or a Google tablet, and use this Fire HD for everything related to Amazon...including making the most of your Kindle library.  I give this item four stars, for the fact that it does NOT integrate with Google, and this is not apparent until (a) after you purchase your tablet or (b) until you have read about it in a review, such as mine, or on a web forum.  Otherwise, this tablet does all it says it does, and it is a FANTASTIC purchase as a family tablet, with all of its family-friendly features, and still allowing the adults in the family to access all their own content, and even to create their own profiles.  I own several Android smartphones, a Google Nexus 7, and a couple Android Nextbooks, in addition to the HD Fire.  I believe this is a good addition to my collection, and recommend its purchase"
kid still love it
Great little gadget for what my wife was looking for.
Since purchasing my kindle fire hd I have used it in more ways then I had originally planned. It takes quality pictures and it is very easy to post to social media from kindle. I have also done the same thing with videos. I also use the Ereader quite regularly. We have other tablets but this one by far is the most user friendly.
This is my second Kindle Fire and is an upgrade from the first generation. I don't think the battery charges as quickly or stays charged as long but I am very pleased with it.
"2 years of using this and one speaker no longer works the screen stays black with sound playing they seem to think its not charged is the only problem, not very happy and wont buy another one!"
I love the feature that allows you to set up different profiles for adults and children. Amazon Freetime is an excellent way to monitor your children's content and screen time and to protect them from the Internet.
I love my Kindle Fire. It's easy to use which is great for me I am in no way tech inclined. It was ready to go right out of the box!!
"I simply love my kindle, I use it daily, my fire 7 inch second gen, was terrific, if you own an old kindle you know what I'm talking about, the only thing, no camera, so on prime day i was up extra early to get a new one, basically the same, just high def, and front and rear camera, this is absolutely the best deal on a tablet, easy-to-use, tons of cloud at my disposal, Amazon has got this figured out, excellent product and service."
Like it
Love my Fire Kindle.
My Mom loves her new tablet!  Not bad for 80 dollars!
When it works it's wonderful.  I am on my fifth one and this one is broken. Number 4 was DOA but I paid for the other 4. Poor quality in my humble opinion
"The Fire HD7 that was ordered for me as a Father's Day present would not start or take a charge, so I sent it back to Amazon. The Fire HD7 that was sent to me came in Magenta. Although is works okay, the color is totally unacceptable. Even more so since I was not advised by Amazon Customer Service that the only color available was Magenta. I am patiently waiting for the Fire HD7 in Black to be shipped."
Very happy with this..  It took me awhile to get use to commercials but I' m over it.  Very easy to buy and browse from.
commercials...yuk
I have to say - I like reading on these better than the iPad. The only negative is it doesn't do interactive books.
"I got it for the Lending Library.  It was upon receipt of this that I discovered the Lending Library is limited to one book per month.  That would have been nice to know Prior to purchase, but finding information about the Lending Library is not easy.<br /><br />Next dislike about this thing is that it's full of ads.  I can pay $15 to remove those ads.  Hogwash!<br /><br />There's no way to quickly close out of an app.  One must go to the settings then into the Applications section then into the application setting to clear the cache.  There is a way to clear the cache for all apps at once, but that's not what I want.<br /><br />It heats up fast.<br /><br />Loses charge fast.<br /><br />The camera quality is grainy and fogged.<br /><br />You cannot customize it with your own wallpaper.<br /><br />There's really not anything I like about this item."
I never had a tablet before this is really easy to use hardly ever use my laptop now<br /><br /> .
"So you did not have any the four times I tried to get one for $79.00 on Wed, but now you offer the  same thing at $139.00? Don't think so."
"The kindle is a great purchase. Perfect for reading, browsing or games. It's even great for some bedtime prime video viewing. It fits perfectly in one hand, is light and the screen is clear and easy to view in most light. Very happy with my purchase."
I was so excited to finally buy a kindle and the deal offered on the 20th anniversary was too good to pass up. The 16 gigs were sold out so I settled on the 8 gig. I downloaded one movie to watch on an upcoming trip since I would be flying. Immediately after I saw a message saying my storage was low. I only had like 300 megabytes left. One movie took of 3 gigs and I assume the rest was taken up my operating systems. I purchased the movie vs renting it and now I will have to erase the movie if I plan to ever use the tablet again. I'm actually thinking about sending the kindle back.
"its fast enough, clear picture, land the screen fits nicely in my hand.  I will like it more as soon as I find out how what all it will do."
Having a few problems with it.  Will taking back to have it checked out.
its everything I expected.
I hope I can learn to do all it can do. I really have enjoyed it so far!
Not able to get the app I thought I could get on it.
Well I didn't have enough GB
i am getting my 4th one in 6 months. Freezes up constantly.<br />first 1 worked ok for a few months. Then it froze up. The 2 replacements froze out of the box.<br />Every other tablet out there is better than this
Mine is defective
"This is the second unit we have purchased, it is replacing a Kindle that failed. With that said the previous Kindle failed due to the heavy use and the treatment of a 12 year old. She used it a lot and that failure was not due to quality issues, so please do not think there are reliability problems with the Kindle. (the first Kindle lasted about 2 years)  This unit was upgraded with more memory and so far my daughter is very happy with the new version. She uses this for everything from reading, to web activity, you tube, and Skyping with her friends. It is very versatile. This is a very safe purchase you will get great value from it."
Have really enjoyed this kindle. Next best thing to my iPhone without the steep price. I use it more than I imagined. The only regret is that I didn't purchase it sooner.
"I received this a couple of days ago.  Display is ok and works well.<br />It seems to be taking forever to charge the battery - is this normal?  I was very annoyed with the ads that come on when the thing is turned on but  I did a search and found out how to remove it  When I pay for something, I shouldn't have to deal with ads but I guess Amazon gets some extra money for this."
I'm totally satisfied with this product. Amazon has never let me down.
"just love my new Kindle, this is the 3rd one I have had. gave the older one to kid to play games."
I just got this Kindle HD a few days ago and I love it! I have the Paper white and a Nook tablet and thus is probably my favorite so far. Connects to Goodreads and FB easily and I can listen to my Amazon music while I read. Perfect tablet for reading. Beautiful screen too!
Awesome
Love it but wish I could get on the google play store great picture and sounds better than my wife's I paid air
"It's a good tablet for the price, but it was freezing the first time I used it. Will have to wait and see how it works over a period of time."
Seemed to complicated for my 5 yr old grandson. I gave that to his mother and she likes it. I got the boy a cubby which he loves.
"Review is for ORDERING and delivery of the product, not the item itself.  Basically ordered the item as part of the 'Prime Day' event on a Wednesday and selected a 2 day delivery - on Friday.

There were no instructions with it. Am still having trouble getting &#34; around&#34; in the programs.<br />  Many questions I can't find answers for.
I love my fire. This is my second one. I prefer it over other tablets.
"I’m writing based on my experience with the previous generation of this product, but the concern has less to do with the performance, while it worked, as to the quality of manufacturing and the service received by the company afterwards which seems a more serious problem. My eight year old son purchased the Kindle fire with his own “hard=earned” money we chipped in for the extended warranty and the case knowing that there could be issues with and Eight year old and a tablet. We were sold due to the sophistication of the parental controls and how we thought they will encourage his reading. Within a month the product froze up, under warranty we got an easy exchange, after that switch the tablet lasted a year when the screen shut down. As the tech support identified the screen as “dead”, and as we are two month past the warranty there is nothing they can do about it, no fix, no exchange, but a “discounted” price which is higher than currently sold outright on a retailer or in the Amazon market place. So my son has a $200 paperweight and Amazon expect me to purchase another one. (By the way he took great care of it, no dings, nicks or even scratches) I understand about planned obsolescence but two tablets within a year seem extreme, and makes this more of a disposable product than I could recommend. My wife has an iPad, and I have a nexus, both products are excellent and worth the cost. If Amazon’s expectations is that we will purchase a new one every year,  in three years you have already paid for the iPad which has more apps, more programs and more capacity, even less to  pay for the nexus, mine even got wet and still works. If you’re looking for a disposable tablet that lasts a year, go ahead and get as you will save some money but if you expect the product to last longer than that, get something else as not only it will cost the same but you have to add the hassle of having to deal with customer service every time it goes down. Remember YOUR time is also worth something… STAY AWAY"
My granddaughter
"I can't watch a youtube video on hd? C'mon, it's 2015. I don't know if you have a feud with google or something but no official youtube app??"
I bought a book and downloaded it and it doesn't work. I can't figure out how to use it in the Sun. I do not find this product to be user friendly at all
"Great picture and the apps you can get are nice, but limited.  Not being able to  play/get 80% of the apps out there for android is very frustrating.  Just like the kid's tablets, it doesn't always respond well.  I would suggest buying a tablet that isn't restricted from google play.  Your missing out on way too much."
I got this for a present and took advantage of &#34;Christmas in July&#34;  I already have a Kindle and LOVE mine.  I am sure the recipient of this kindle is going to love theirs as well.  Makes it nice that this one has 2 cameras and many cool things that came with it. Can't wait to give it to him.
Maybe I haven't learned all the ins and outs yet but my old Kindle appears to be more responsive and sophisticated...
It was a Birthday present for my wife! I am a hero for another day or maybe two.
"You get what you pay for it.<br />My friend had a kindle and loved it. She has had several in the past four years. She said the Fire is by Amazon it too must be a solid product. It has turned out to be a solid piece of crap. Purchased in April 2015 for $80 when there was a sale. I had wanted an iPad but thought this should do. It broke in July 2015.  It wouldn't turn on. Called Amazon support which I did not know they outsourced their customer service to India.  The first person I spoke to attempted to troubleshoot with me then she asked if I could try charging it for an hour and a half. She would call me back.  No call back two hours later so I called. I spoke with Stepahie who also tried to troubleshoot it. No luck so she said she'd mail me a new one. I explained paid for a screen cover and didn't expect to have to purchase another one a couple months later, so she said there would be one in my shipment.  I thought great and wonderful customer service. When I got my package my screen cover wasn't there. I called explaining my situation and was told they do not give the covers out for free. Eventually, after two hours three calls, one hang up on me and a supervisor later I got my screen cover. Of course, it doesn't fit my Fire. Horrible product and experience. I love buying stuff on Amazon!! I am a prime member! This experience just reminded me that Amazon should stick to fulfillment (pick, packing and shipping).  I am sad and just wanted to share my experience and the lesson I learned."
"Never pay Amazon to gift wrap a package! Worst wrapping job I have ever seen, literally. The paper was ripped and looked like someone had already started to open it."
"I love my kindle fire. The best part is that I can set up my 3 year old son up a profile and for $5 a month he gets unlimited apps, shows, and books for his age!!"
Love it!
"I ordered this for my wife's birthday to replace her ageing HP Touchpad.  From the moment she opened it she's been thrilled.  She loves the look and feel of it, the light weight (especially after the Touchpad), and the size.  She's been using it regularly since she got it, and has tried everything from the Kindle app to Pandora.  She even commented on how much faster the Silk browser is on it than Chrome on the Touchpad.<br /><br />Setup was impossibly easy.  She turned it on and it was already configured for her Amazon account, with all of her books ready to go.<br /><br />She couldn't be more pleased, which means I'm pretty happy too."
Bought for my husband and he loves it.
Great deal from Amazon Prime day.
"I would love to tell you what my newest kindle is like but I can't hook it up. Your support group speaks too fast and with an Asian accent so I didn't understand what he was saying.  I am very frustrated obviously.  And just for the record I have two college degrees , so my stupidly is not the problem  Audrey mochel"
I bought this for my little brother and it works great. There's always accidents with him so he occasionally drops it and there's no visible scratches.
"I have not had time to learn how to fully use the device. I do not seem to be able to sign off and even when I turn it off with the button, it evidently keeps running because the next day the charge reads just 20% of the battery left or some similar reading. I hope after reading the manual I can learn how to operate it better and also download some games for my two granddaughters to play."
This is my second Kindle Fire.  I love it.  I won a Kindle reader and gave it to my husband.  It's great for him when he travels for work.
"This is the 4th Kindle I've purchased and it may be my last. I am having one very specific problem for which there appears to be no fix. When signing into a third party internet service (the type of service used by hotels, restaurants and hospital waiting rooms, for example), I cannot get a wifi connection. If the site needs an acceptance of terms sign-in, it just sits there in la-la land. In a hotel that I stay in regularly, I call their internet help desk and they can get me logged in by adding my mac address manually. It's a time-consuming process and very annoying. They have told me this is a regular problem with the newer Kindle Fires. My previous Kindle Fire did not have this problem. But the Fire HD 7 does.  I've talked to tech support and the only suggestion they have for me is to try restoring to factory and reinstalling my stuff (can anyone say royal pain in the . . .?) or calling them when I get to one of the places where my wifi won't work. If this problem can't be fixed, it is highly unlikely that I will buy another Kindle."
"Not impressed with the battery drain, both cameras are from 2004 it seems. Not very smooth, but I guess I can root and change the UI<br /><br />Got a deal on it with prime day, otherwise I would return it"
"I just purchased this for my daughter. She loves it and says it's better than my 2012 Kindle Fire HD 7. Myself, I have no idea...she won't let me see it long enough to check it out!! Lol."
got a great deal on Prime Day!  We've been looking for a tablet and the Fire HD 7 is great!  Nice size and will be great for the little things we're looking to do with it.  Hooray!
"I love my new Fire, it's my third kindle. My husband took over my second one. We both love to read and use them daily. I have also discovered that I can do most anything on it that I do on a computer. I love being able to sit in a comfy chair and do my thing. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The graphics are great and it is user friendly."
"It is an okay tablet as far as for reading goes. If you want to play games or do anything else on it, it gets a bit warm as you use it. But I don't mind it for the main reason I got it, so I don't have to read on my phone any longer. If you want to play your facebook games or any other game, you need to go with another tablet..<br /><br />There is also a problem with the tablet locking up and having to reboot it. I think I will end up buying a different tablet and replacing it with another brand. Even at 60% price, it wasn't worth what I paid as often as I am having to shut it down."
I ordered green and received white. How can I fix this?
This is one of the best purchases that I have ever made for my daughter. At 9 years old it's perfect for her however it's perfect for adults as well. It is. The perfect size and also had the perfect price at less then $100. It is so easy for her to use and provides hours of fun with its many low cost to free apps. I definitely don't regret this purchase
"I have to be a little tougher on this review since it is a higher priced tablet. This is really about a 4.5. I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 because of a few things. First of all, I do not appreciate that my start screen is an ad for Amazon Coins. I paid a lot of money for this so I should have an ad free tablet! But, still that is not that annoying. Hoping I can find a way to get that off of there. Then the other thing is that it is a little confusing where to find things I need. I suppose that will get better with time so maybe my review will go up to a 5 eventually. One other negative this is that it won't let me access my Prime Music. It says I need to renew my Prime membership. My Prime membership does not expire until December! So now the good. The picture quality is really good. I have easy access to Kindle books which is the main reason we bought it. It has a lot of apps and games just like any tablet. The layout is big and easy to see. I have a little bad eyesight so that is good. I will try to come back and update my review after I have more time to see how I like it."
"As a true bookworm, I must have everything related to books. This gadget was on my wish list for a long time, but because I still get immense pleasure from reading and feeling the actual books, it took me about 2 years to make this decision, but then it sort of happened as an impulse buy at BestBuy. Nevertheless, I enjoy it very much. The screen is fairly lit and doesn't bother my eyes even if it's lit to the fullest. It was quite the adjustment for the system because I own everything apple, and some of things that I wish were different is how to close all the running apps. Which leads me to the small disappointment of how quickly the battery drains for a device that is CONSTANTLY on airplane mode, and is being used ONLY to read for 5 hours the longest. In one week it would go from 90% to 51% while being &#34;used&#34; as described above. Meanwhile charge for an iPad last for weeks if I would do the same thing as I do with the kindle, but the downside of iPads is the brighteness and graphics on the screen is NOT made for your eyes to be strained like that. Overall, kindle of course has a great potential to be used for gaming, movie-watching and a lot more, but my sole purpose is for books and I love it a lot. Also the size is absolutely perfect, it is very light to be held by one hand AND I got an awesome case for it and it is still very light. So by all means I do recommend it for the asking price which is really not at all expensive compared to others, and it's basic functions are just enough unless you are obsessed with doing something with or on your gadgets."
I like it and plan to use it for video stuff
"I love it. It's super handy, fast and small enough to take with me. I got it for a gift for Fathers day. Thanks my dear."
Awesome!
should include a written guide with it and how to get on wi fi to use it  for other things
"Can't see much difference in this one and old one.  The &#34;on&#34; button on this one is just horrible.  It may as well be totally recessed.  One has to just about get a coin to turn this one on,  The old one was a mere touch or slide down the side. Not worth the money.  I wore my old one out is the only reason I bought a new one.  Totally disappointed."
"It works great, but I wish I could use it on my Chromecast so I could see tv shows on tv via &#34;Fire&#34;"
"I'm still adjusting to it, but like it real well.  Thank you.."
"I purchased this Fire HD 7 as an upgrade to my Kindle Fire because I wanted the camera features that my older Kindle doesn't have.  I am very pleased with the quality of the photos and the ease of posting the photos to my Facebook account.  I want to be able to use it when I travel so that I can keep in touch back home by sharing photos.  I set up Skype on this Fire HD7 but I have only used it once with my daughter and we had problems but I think it is a Skype issue.  The clarity on the videos I have watched is fantastic and the size of the screen is great for viewing.  The only disappointment is that the battery fully charged offers a lot less time before recharging than my older Kindle.  For this reason, I am keeping my old Kindle for reading my Kindle books and a few of my games."
"I love my tablet.  It was easy to use and set up.  Still figuring it out, but I do love it.  Thanks"
"I purchased this for my mother,she just loves it."
It has most of what we need on it to be a device needed daily. Certainly some app differences but much easier for me to hold
It's a great price for what you get. The main problems that I found were the glare from the screen when light shines on it as well as how the Kindle lags when typing.
"I brought this on &#34;Prime Day&#34;, fantastic deal, I gave it as a gift and the receiver loves it.  I might have to order one  for me and I already have 2 other Kindles.  Loved the size and the graphics"
no comment
I really love my Fire HD.
"I love it. Perfect size. Can find apps that I need. Much faster than my other tablet, even faster than my computer with downloads. Great price."
"This Fire 7 HD is just perfect for my my ability to understand and master a new technology.<br />Fire is just the thing for a senior citizen to tackle. I have had the unit about two weeks and<br />learn something new every day. When you run into a snag you just ask Google for help and<br />I've gotten the help every time I needed it to the solve the problem.But I am pissed I bought<br />the unit before the July 15 sale, I could have saved about sixty dollars"
I just love it!!
I really do like this Fire HD 7. The only mild dissatisfaction is with the battery. I'm constantly charging it.
"Had put off going to an book but this one takes care of the &#34;Need to Read&#34; and has a few more capabilities I will use. Intuitive design, easy reading in most light.  Thanks!"
"I am very disappointed in this product! It does not want to turn on or off when you push the power button, when you try to swipe the screen or tap on it, it does not respond unless you do it 10 times! I would not recommend this kindle to anyone, it was a total waste of money!"
"9/3/15 I simply have no idea what this kindle us good for. I bought the cable to connect to my S5 so I could transfer over 300 pics and 350 songs and it took 20 mins to get 15 pics transfered. My S5 has less than 1gb of storange used with all my apps , pics and music but this 8gb kindle thst I can get nothing hooked up to or Bluetooth any if my 8 speakers too tells me I have only 4gb if storage Left!  Thst was after a had to factory reset the thing 3 times. I did not want this headache and I cannot recommend it.  I bought 2, one was a gift and both were supposidly brand new but when first turned on, they had the wrong name on the top left of the screen and my email address was on the gift kindle as well as mine. I got mine a month later because I ordered the black. How us any personal info on it to begin with???<br />Not feeling good about Amazon security at this point but maybe they come pre loaded with ESP?  Cliff Ridley"
It is<br />Awesome.
Very Good product. Easy to use and setup
"my only dislikes are very minimal, the fact I can't personalize my background is kinda meh for me, I feel like it takes away from it that I can't personalize it more. I also am not a fan of not having instagram app like what is with that?<br />I was going to buy my original nexus 7 again but unfortunately google doesn't make them anymore, the Nexus 7 tablet had a wonderful camera and had an easy way to go through apps.<br /><br />Things you could do to fix this is that the camera could be a bit better, the kindle fire needs to be able to be more personalized like personal wallpapers and definitely get the instagram app not everyone wants to use some off brand app that none of their friends have. Also why have Vine but not instagram?<br />I will say overall it'll do for now."
Connected yesterday and still hoping my books from my kindle.  Also the videos that I already paid for with roku are asking me to pay again.  This needs to be fixed.
"I have been trying to work on the Fire HD 7 for several hours. I keep getting a message that I am not connected to the internet, but if I look at my connections it clearly shows I am connected to my  home Wi-Fi. I have installed two updates right out of the box. I purchased this for Mirroring Option, but when I follow the directions it seems that this Fire HD does not support display mirroring. I have tried different applications and I can say that I am just so disappointed. I tried to set up profiles for my kids and I could never get it to work. I just gave up after multiple attempts. I hate the ads every time I turn it on and I have had to restart it several times to get it to work.  I also had some problems with the pages &#34;hanging&#34;. I would wait and wait for something to load and nothing would happen. I am so frustrated that I am sending it back then same day I received it."
"Good buy, my granddaughter loves it"
I grabbed this for only $79 on Prime Day and you can't do much better price wise on a good 7&#34; tablet. Quick Prime shipping and a great price on a quality product make this purchase a five star pick up.
"Starting at $139 or £119, the 7-inch tablet features a faster processor with better graphics performance than its predecessor and ships with Amazon's latest Android-based Sangria operating system. The new OS now has better battery saving functions, allows individual profiles - great for sharing amongst families -- and permits content sharing between different Fire devices, though the feature has yet to roll out. It also comes in a cheaper 6-inch model for those with smaller hands -- or tighter wallets. Pricing and availability in Europe and Australia has yet to be announced, but the US price works out to about €90 or AU$160."
"Too much to write, but you will love this. Had 1st generation Kindle and gave that to my daughter when I needed to upgrade, and this new one doesn't disappoint. A ton of storage space for apps, user friendly, and great camera. In my opinion, the BEST tablet for book lovers and social media addicts. You will not be disappointed with this Kindle!"
This is my 1st tablet and I just love it.  It has so many features - I discover new things everyday!
"Amazing!! Meets all my needs. Lightweight, great sound, easy to handle.  Great buy!"
Awesome
I love the size and clarity of the screen but it does not function well with things it needs to be connected to a network to do. It will be connected to Wi-Fi with a strong connection and different apps will time out with a network error. It's extremely frustrating when you are trying to watch a movie. I've actually given up on trying to watch movie any more.
This was a gift. Recipient loves using this every day.
Love it
My 4th Kindle! Hope this one's charging port holds up!
You like to read? This is the kindle that you need. Very user friendly.Came very well packaged & the build quality is great. I can see this lasting for years. Thanks for the great product.
Great device.  Took me a while to understand the nuances of streaming and downloading.  Definitely stream lowest HD quality if you aren't at home.  8MB is enough if you plan to stream a good bit of the time when traveling.  16 would be much better.
My first Kindle - I'm thrilled !
Love it! Was a great deal for the price! Very comfortable for reading with convenient extras included!
Nt what i expected
Not as good as my previous kindle. It doesn't hold as many downloads as my previous and it has the same memory 8GB. It keeps freezing up and closes pages I start reading sending me back to the main menu. Seriously thinking about returning it!
Gift for granddaughter she loved it
"So I got the Fire today only to fine out that it is missing the power adapter! I'm going to contact Amazon today to see if they will send me one, otherwise I will return it because I can't charge/use it."
"Arrived right on time. If you don't already have a Kindle Fire, good luck. Customer service is an Indian call service. Could not answer a very easy question. It was clear that she was reading a script and could not answer a question. She refused to transfer me to another tech person. Basically figure there is no tech support."
I love it .  where can I get a case for it.
Very easy to set up and get apps I wanted.
"Just purchased this and received it today.  Thought I would be able to use my Bluetooth headphones with it.  Nope.  Kind of bummed about that.  Otherwise, so far so good."
"Love this HD 7<br />So glad I finally decided to order the HD 7. I use it every day and it is so nice to be able to watch shows on here, get the latest on Roku, Amazon etc.  A great buy!!"
"I bought this for my kids ages 6,8 and 10 they all love it the picture is great good sound can use it anywhere that has WiFi. I'm overall very pleased with my purchase got it on sale for $99 would definitely buy another one at regular price."
I purchased this case for my new Kindle Fire. The case is very good quality leather. My Kindle fits perfectly. I would recommend this product.
pretty good.  If it wasn't for amazon prime I think I might have used another one.  But it does what I need it to and I am pleased for the price. I would recommend it to anyone if it meets your basic wants and needs.
Perfect size for travel and I love that you can download prime movies and TV shows to the tablet for viewing when WiFi is not present.
The Kindle itself was nice.  We ordered it for my son's bday.  He used it for exactly 4 weeks and it shut off and wouldn't turn back on.  Called the customer service department and they were happy to replace it with a REFURBISHED one.  So I paid $140 basically for a used Kindle.  We didn't have the option of replacing with a new one since ours was practically new because they are now on backorder.
Works great for my needs & not expensive. Will be getting my daughter's each one.
"amazing tablet with lot's powerful features, the new fire os 5 is a great overall improvement (in terms of performance and user interface), it's still in beta phase but looks and feels very promising, can't wait for the official release! i would recommend this product for anyone looking for a budget tablet with lots of features and also for those who just love the amazon ecosystem. the app store is getting better by the minute."
My son loves it!
"I upgraded from an earlier model and love that this one is lighter! I also like that all of the apps that I use regularly are available and work well. I have always loved the library with the device and cloud options and that is still wonderful. The only downside is that the hardshell is slicker than the earlier model which makes it harder to prop up for reading. Overall, a wonderful product:)"
"I don't know if it's not working right or what but it doesn't work near as well as my last Kindle Fire.  It seems like I have to turn it off and on a lot to get it to work right.  I hope this is just the newness of it and that changes.  I LOVED my last Kindle Fire, the only reason I got a new one was because my son damaged the charging port and it was going to cost me almost as much to fix it as to buy a new one.  Kind of wishing now I had just gotten the old one fixed."
Awesome
"This is my 3rd Kindle.  I had one...then my daughter kept borrowing it, so I gave her mine and bought a new one... which my husband kept borrowing so I bought him one.  I love it. They love it."
"Love my new Kindle Fire HD. Perfect  delivery, quick recharge and great screen."
"Perfect size! It's great for its main purpose for reading, but it's surely can't handle (too slow) other apps such as games, Facebook, etc."
I love my Kindle. The only negative thing would be that I am concerned about charging it because it is difficult to plug in the charger to the device and to pull it out.  That was what went out on my old Kindle. The Kindle still works but I can't charge it because the charging socket is loose and the plug does not connect. I'mean concerned that it will happen on my new device.
"Defective product, even want me to pay return label fee"
Awesome
"The kids like them, but I bought 2 and only one of them will link to my Amazon account. How do I get the other to link up? I have Kindle on my phone and I get emails on what they are downloading, but just one of them."
"I love my tablet. i can do anything with it. watch movies, read audiobooks, play games and so much more. It is a kindle book reader as well. I do recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a great experience with a tablet. This tablet is the perfect size to take with you anytime or anywhere."
I am very pleased with my Kindle Fire.
"Love the Kindle HD Fire! for reading...its amazing! that is the primary purpose why I upgraded to the HD Fire. Lots of other kool little apps & features. The music aspect...does not appeal to me, as it requires you to purchase from Amazon or be a Prime member. I just wanted to be able to transfer my music from iTunes to this device; however, do not find this easy to do. Overall, satisfied."
"This thing is such an excellent buy. It performs very well for it's size. If you want to have a small tablet to read on, play games, and occasionally surf the net, this thing is a steal at the price!"
My daughter has had hers for six months she takes very good care of it. I bought a nice case for it. It has froze non stop. Sometimes  it takes hours before she can play it sometimes she can turn it off and it will  let her turn it off and start it up again.
"This is my second kindle and it is much better than the first generation.  More memory, faster speed, better display and sound. definitely a lot of bang for your buck."
"Exactly as described. Love kids mode, ability for apps like a smart phone and then a book to quietly read. I would purchase again!"
"Love it. At first I was not happy about upgrading. But, so glad I did."
I can't believe that the kindle locks screen automatically comes with ads - I am so disgusted with amazon right now.  You will have to pay an extra 15$ to remove the ads.  Disgusted.  Would give 5 stars otherwise - I bought the original fire and just got this one for my sister because I love mine so much.  So disappointed.
"I bought it thanks to Amazon's Prime Day.  It was at $79+tax.  I bought it and wanted to was comparing it to Kindle 6&#34; for &#34;reading&#34; comfort.  Fire HD 7 didn't have the function, where it can have the actual book or paper color background. It's actually like most of other tablets, but with it's smaller market of amazon apps, comparing to other 2 major competitor, and 8GB is really not enough..."
Great product
Sound quality is great
Met all my expectations.
"So unhappy with Amazon today, as apparently, are many others!  Why advertise a promotion when you don't allow people to buy the product?  What a scam!  Been a prime member for years, feel like Amazon doesn't value my business!  And worse, knowingly treats me like you know what!!"
"I have bought some cheap $80 Android tablets in the past and they were sluggish. The Fire, it runs real nice and fast. Well worth the bang for the buck!"
"The Fire HD 7, 7&#34; HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB  I purchased has been great!  This is my 3rd Kindle and once again I am thoroughly enjoying it and appreciate the quality work of Amazon."
"This is a great device though I am feeling a bit over whelmed regarding using it and am getting bombarded regarding offers.  I'm also a bit worried about surprise charges popping up.  I'm sure I'll be more comfortable after awhile, but I will need a little more time."
Had 4 Kindle Readers - this Fire is fabulous.  I had no idea.
"I tried to buy one of the 16 MB on Prime Day, was on multiple waitlists, and like many others never had an opportunity to purchase a Fire HD 7. I hope this is the last Prime Day because it was a huge bust."
VERY HAPPY WITH THE FIRE!
Good product. The &#34;pay $20 to get rid of advertisements&#34; thing is shameful. Really Amazon? Get with the times.
"I love this little tablet, but it did not include any special offers.  I bought it on a closeout from Staples.  That's probably why."
perfect
Do not like it as much as my previous fire HD. It is not as user friendly.Also the battery does not last as long. Like the fact that it has a camera.
I like the size and convenience of traveling with it.  It's the right size to read books and play games.  Would recommend to others.
"Got this for my wife, this is her third kindle. The new design is much sharper then earlier models. I recommend this model."
met our expectations. My daughter is enjoying it.
I love it.  It is very easy to use & understand.
"It is everything I expected, I am disappointed that I bought it a week before prime day and then found it on sale.  I felt I should have been offered a credit."
"Love it, works great for kids"
"Love it. Only drawback is my fault,wish I had gotten a 16 GBP vs only 8. You will not be disappointed in anyway."
husband lost his on a plane....great deal works good.
"I'm an avid reader, and up until a year ago I would frequently go to the book store to buy soft or hardcover books. That all changed when I bought a Kindle Fire. With the beautiful HD screen, books came to life. I no longer got tired after reading softcover books late at night.<br /><br />Having the ability to adjust the brightness and page color as well as highlighting anything that's important to you, changing the font and font size, etc. It's all so easy to do. What's great is that the Fire is also a full fledged tablet! From a huge app library to email and web browsing, as well as  cameras, it's amazing! I cannot recommend this highly enough! Buy it already and you won't look back!"
I recently all my kindles exactly
awesome
"I dont know why people are posting negative reviews if they werent able to get the product and test it out. I have one and i use it more than my ipad. The picture and sound quality are great. I use it to watch movies, tv shows, read books, listen to music, search the internet. During the special Prime day i bought one for my parents. Im excited to get it so i can set it up for them. :)"
I'm in love with this!!!
Bought this as a gift for my mother so that we could share books.  She loves it!!
Love it
Gran son is enjoying it
"Pretty good tablet for $99.  I've grown to like the carousel approach to the home screen.  The build quality and screen are very good.  It's a bit on the heavy side for a 7&#34; tablet.  Integration into Amazon services works very well (Videos, Music, Cloud Photos, Books).  If you're a Prime subscriber, you can really take advantage of these services.  On the negative side, there's no access to the Google Play Store.  There are lots of apps that are not available through the Amazon store.  I can live w/o the GMail app since the email client on the Fire can be configured to work with GMail.  But there are many other apps I wish were available (Google Hangouts, Chrome, Clash of Clans, ...).  The browser that comes on the Fire doesn't stack up against Chrome and Chrome isn't available in the Amazon app store.  There don't appear to be any other trustworthy browsers available in the Amazon app store.  In summary, if I wasn't a Prime member, I'd rather have a true Android tablet."
Love it. The color is great. Watched two movies so far..
"I can't get the one game I spent most of my time on, UNO."
PERFECT FOR MY NON IPAD HUSBAND.
TOO COMPLICATED!!!! ALL I WANTED WAS TO DOWNLOAD A BOOK TO IT - I DON'T WANT THE COMPUTER!
Gift for my son's 12th birthday--he loves it!
"Llove it, other than the non Google thing..."
"Not bad for watching amazon prime, or listening to amazon music, or shopping on amazon....Other than that, its just a big smart phone (without the phone function)."
"So I was lucky enough to get a cobalt one of these for $99 during Prime Day (considering it was pretty much the ONLY deal worth getting on Prime Day), and I was pretty happy as this will be my first tablet. THEN, I go look to see when it will be arriving only to discover this: Arriving Aug. 12-13. REALLY!?!? I won't get it for a whole MONTH? I mean, you guys are the ones who planned Prime Day, right? And you knew how many Kindle's you were going to offer up for sale, right? Then why in the WORLD didn't you plan to have enough on hand to actually SHIP after you sold them?!?!? So it's not going to arrive in time for my upcoming trip. AND the more I look at it, the more it looks like I'm going to have to spend on it, for warranty (cuz it sounds like they break easy from reading reviews), to protective screens and cases and styluses. Man, at this point I'm thinking I'm better off just canceling my purchase and accepting Prime Day for the flop it was..."
"I just bought this this for my mother on prime day. I also had a little trouble ordering but called... There staff was very friendly and helped me with out a hitch. She is so excited. Thank you Amazon, you rock, and I always been happy with the product and service you provide."
"Got this on Prime Day. Had no idea that it comes supported with ads that I had to pay 14.99 to get rid of. I couldn't download any apps from Google Play, so most apps I couldn't use or had to get second rate versions. You can't even put a wallpaper up. I spent a few hours with it before I started the return process. Really disappointed."
So far so good...2 weeks.
"Waited for big deal day on Amazon for Prime members to buy this tried for 6 hours put myself on waitlist on 3 different Kindle Fires. Started at 7 AM morning of sale after 6 hours still said on was on waitlist for 2,left for 20 minutes to pick up my Granddaighter still on waitlist upon return ,got her snac and settled in 10 minutes came back all my selections were no longer available!! Shame on you Amazon I buy from you ALOT I am in a rural area not once did I receive any notification that it was time to claim said could put it on my smart phone only problem my smart phone has no reception in many places where I was at and never notice a notification on my lap top and I refreshed every 10 minutes. What a gimmick! I don't think you increased your Prime membership and if you did I don't think they will stay with all the other junk you put deals on. Guess Wal Mart will get my tablet business and this was a Christmas gift I already have bought 3 Kindles for myself.I don't think I'll be renewing the benefits are not anything like they were when I joined over 3 yrs ago."
"If you are considering buying this Kindle I would definitely get the extended warranty. Better yet just buy something else.  This is my second Kindle and this one was delivered on May 7th 2015 and is no longer working.  As soon as you turn the screen on the battery bar goes into free fall mode until you get the warning to plug into a charger, almost immediately after that pops up it powers itself off. the Kindle is plugged into the charger while this is happening. The charge on this Kindle has never lasted very long. I have contacted customer service and I am waiting to hear back.  My first Kindle's battery no longer charges properly either but at least it lasted in the 2 yr. range."
love this device!
"Great tablet for a really good price.  This is my third Kindle Fire and they just keep getting better each year.  If you are a prime member, the content on the kindle is great with lots of free video and music."
Love the Fire. Reading seems better for my eyes than Paperwhite (which I also love). I only read on the tablet.
"Works great. Easy to use. This is my 2nd Kindle. My other one still works, but I wanted one with more storage."
Love
"I have a first generation kindle that has survived my clutz self and two children and is still ticking. But it does not play all the new apps and is a &#34;drag&#34; for watching hulu and netflix. I bought this new kindle and was thrilled except for the postal delivery who left a wet box on my front porch. Needles to say with in a few weeks my new baby had to go back to amazon and that is where my five stars really go..the amazon customer service was phenomenal. I told them the issues and they had a new kindle to me with in three days. I sent the arrived wet one back and am thrilled with my new kindle.<br />Now I am not a person who does the OS (operating system for you non nerds) and all the bells and whistles, but I do know what works and that is a kindle HD 7. This is a tablet that can be used. The sound alone is worth it as I no longer have to have a small set of speakers I plugged into my mp3 player or old kindle, I just set the HD7 on the stand, load up my prime music and play. The camera leaves a bit to be desired, but it is not what I bought my kindle for anyway. The touch screen is responsive even in a protective casing. I downloaded two games just to see how the kindle would handle. It worked great no issues even with being outside and a 100 yards away from our wireless upstairs it was streaming video. The HD 7 is light and powerful. It's load times and video play are great for hulu, netflix and prime video. It even plays the subbed anime I watch with print that I can read. I have logged on facebook, web crawled for recipes, and yesterday I bought another kindle HD7 for my kids. I am going to do the amazon free time for kids on that one and make it a dedicated kids system. This is a user friendly item that I love and will give as a gift to my octogenarian."
So far this one works
One of the best purchases I've made in a long time. Easy to use and very intuitive.
I love my Kindle Fire. Now I caught up with my kids with all this new technology. I am very pleased
"Hello,<br /><br />i am based here in saudi arabia. i would like to purchase a Fire Hd7. I am a prime member too.<br />would it work here? can i use my privilege to use kindle to watch movies etc?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /> Gerico"
Multifunctional..just what this Grammy needed.
This will be my second Kindle and I love them. I got lucky and purchased one this morning while trolling the internet and remembered about Prime Day and can't wait to get it. I thought twice about buying it since I don't need it but could not beat the price (saved $60) and I could always gift it... Winning!
very happy with it.
"The FIRE was an excellent purchase, and I have recommended it to many. Even with 200 channels available on my television, I have the FIRE as my primary source of entertainment all in one small package. It is easy to navigate, there is 24 hour help for an questions (A rare necessity) , and there are an abundance of programs for free as well as purchase. Truly, I count it as one of my best purchases."
Had the 1st and 2nd generation kindle. ..loving this one
My Fire HD 7.7 is great.  It is my second Kindle.  My 8.9 I mostly use at home.  Changing from one to the other works so well keeping track of pages of books.  Also was amazed to find all apps and Amazon available. This makes them a &#34;twin&#34; except for size.  THANK YOU!
My daughter loves this HD7
I love my fire. But the books I've paid for don't seem to want to download most of the time so I've spent money for nothing.
The off and on switch on the Kindle fire HD 7 in located right where the strap is that holds the kindle in the case I have.  It is hard to turn it on and off.
Great
I was randomly kicked off waitlist multiple times for both the white and black 16 gb versions. I would browse a bit on amazon then come back to check to find that I had been removed from waitlist once again.
I would give it more stars but I cannot load my google stuff onto it. All my apps are backed up to google and Amazon will NOT allow google on this tablet. I bought 2 returned one of them and gave the little one to my wife. I would never tell anyone to purchase this because of amazon not allowing me to choose what I put on a tablet that I purchase.<br /><br />I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10&#34; and I enjoy it.
My husband loves it !
Highly disappointed with amazon can't order anything been a prime member for 3+ Yrs.
I love my kindle but the ads that pop up on the Main screen while charging are annoying....I even turned them off but they are still there... would give a 5 otherwise
This was actually a purchase for a friend.  Our family has many different versions of  iPad's which I am able to compare this with.  This is a great cheep tablet which can do a lot.  It is thicker than an iPad but that really is no big deal particularly if it holds up better.  We lost two iPad's already because of broken screens.  Much more responsive than my older iPad 2.  If you can handle the smaller screen this is great.
Really pissed! Trying to get the $79 Prime Deal today. Says there is only 58% claimed on the black one and 98% on the white and will not let me get either! What a joke!
"Received a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for Xmas 2013, loved it!!! It lasted 17 months! It is dead, black screen, no help to reset etc..will not turn on. Good customer support.....but unit is dead. A lot of money for something that only lasted 17 months! soooo, yes buying the smaller 7&#34; hope it last longer. if the 7 does not last longer I'll change to a I pad"
"My first Kindle cover, had Kindle embossed on the open tab, and opened like a book . . . good!<br />This new one labeled Ovoe opens opposite or contrary to how books open.  Awkward at best.<br />Must be installed this way for access to the controls.<br /><br />Is this a manufacturing error?  If not a poor design and not up to Amazon quality that is<br />regularly experience."
"I like it, it defiantly is a great 'in-between' for my lap top and phone.<br />I love how easy it is to get books! One of the only downfalls I have to say about it is that Instagram isn't able to be downloaded."
very dissappointed that the system is not letting me at to my cart
"Amazon has Kindle production down to a fine art! Quick and accurate, this device is a favorite of mine. Amazon is easy to work with and their customer service is unsurpassed."
I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Its Just what I wanted and the price could not be beat!!!
Nice size and lighter than my old kindle. I am hoping that kindles's charging port issues have been resolved.I am holding my judgment till I see how this issue goes.
"So Frustrated that I wasn't able to get a Fire HD 7 during the Happy Prime Day, tried for 8+ hours and nothing....UGH!"
Great product . Have bought it before and will buy it again.
This is the least intuitive Kindle I have seen. Text to speech attempt created a monster which not only could not be controlled but read what it wanted to. I was so disgusted I returned the item.
I purchased this for my daughter and it arrived on time and she enjoys it. We both are still learning to use it. I like that I set a time limit to when and if she can access certain content. Will give another review once more familiar with product.
It met all expectations and exceeded them...
"For the $80 price, this is a good little tablet. It's thicker than most and a little heavier. But what do you want for $80. I still ahve to use my Samsung tablet for the important stuff. I would try to get it when on sale."
"So I'm up late & thinking it's time to buy the 7 with the special for today.  Spent a bit of time reading the reviews and comments to figure which options were best.  After reading reviews I want NO ads.  Well less than 2 hours into the promo, guess what is sold out.  The no ads except in 1 color in the 8gb.  From reading the reviews I'd also wanted to get the larger capacity.<br />So on a weeknight you have to stay up and then be ready to buy a deal at midnight sharp or else."
Although I Am still learning the ins and outs I love it!!  great birthday present!
Love it!  I just wish it came with better protection for the front camera.
"It works very well, but I just got it so I will have to get back I love the Fire HD 7, after owning it for some months now I have really enjoyed the features on it. I found that funny looking thing on the keypad was a microphone and I could talk to it for searching anything in my books and it responded very well. I like how it reads for me (in a woman's voice but it sounds natural not mechanical). The sound is great just for a stand alone music source that I like while I read, I like soft music in the background. It has a lot of free apps and brings my e-mail up super fast and performs like my computer. I am well satisfied with my (Fire HD 7). and I bet you will love it to.  I am truly well satisfied with the (Fire HD 7)"
"Where's the GPS? Navagation capability is a standard function on any tablet/smart phone on the planet, except for Amazon's products."
Really love it!
Love it
"Tried for quite a while to order this on Prime Day with no luck, even though 8GB in white was only 98% claimed and black was 58% claimed (went up to 59% while I tried so someone must have had luck) - but not me unfortunately."
"I don't know where to complain - I joined the waitlist for the Prime Day deal on this one - was on the site and next thing I know, the deal was done. No notifications on the page or the phone app. That is just wrong."
"Looks great , a gift for my daughter."
Love it.  Fits in my purse so I always have a book with me.
"Is just what I needed. Easy to use, hold, use more that desk top computer. Use it in my work for posting sale items and keeping track of prices. Very helpful tool."
"I love my Fire HD 7. I mostly use it for email, reading, news, videos, photos, research. It has both a back and forward facing camera. The sound is really nice too. I am not a technology geek but find this tablet easy to use. I highly recommend it!"
I am under the impression that IF I joined prime's free trial that I would be eligible to buy this. I got the run-a-round about my method of paying. I bought something not long ago and there was NO trouble then. This certainly swayed me to a decision NOT to pay for it so I will NOT subscribe to prime. I can spend my money anywhere.

"Just got my new Fire HD 7.  Its lighter than my original Fire.  Love the HD.  But buyers beware - it comes preloaded with lots of aps.  And, while the standard 8G is adequate, buyers are not clearly or adequately warned about how much free space you will actually end up with.  That being said, I am still very pleased with my Kindle Fire.  In fact, my husband will tell anyone interested that I am addicted to my Kindle and wonders if Amazon offers a 12-step program."
Highly disappointed in the Amazon experience.  I currently own 3 Kindle's.  One of my Kindle's is no longer holding a charge.  I contacted amazon to find out the cost of me having this serviced and was told that they do not service these devices.  I was then quoted a price of a new Kindle for purchase.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and expressed my frustration.  He kept silent for a period of time with no remarks then commented if I was still on the phone.  Really?  I am highly disappointed in their customer service and no service on these Kindles.  Moral of the story DO NOT LET THEM BREAK DOWN otherwise you will be purchasing a new one.
"Bought my wife this tablet. She had an older version for years. New tablet is so much nicer. She loves it. One additional perk, as she watches movies you can click on character for information."
Great.
"What a bunch of crap.  Happy Prime Day?  This deal says only 58% filled for the black one, yet it won't let me put it in my cart.  Why run a promotion if all it does is cause frustration for most people."
"I do appreciate the kindle but, the FIRE is to much like a tablet and the screen is backlit, so the reading experience was the same as if I was in my computer or phone.<br />I made the mistake by buying the Fire so I returned the fire and bought the paperwhite and I am extremely satisfied with the paperwhite; it looks more like paper and at night it is so much easier to read, plus it is basic and just for books"
Loving it. Easier to navigate
I tried to add this to my cart all morning and Amazon wouldn't let me. Tried almost all the different colors that all had not been sold out. When the system finally did work it said it was all gone. I've been a prime member for years and spent all morning trying to purchase a Kindle. Looks like Amazon spent more money and effort into advertising Prime day than actually selling stuff on the day itself.<br /><br />Very disappointed and annoyed I my wasted time.
It is very hard to view the screen when you are out in the sun.
I am completely disappointed in this product.  The battery is garbage. I purchased this for trips and the battery won't last an hour.
I like the tablet but I wish the instructions on how to get started were easier to understand.  I still do not know how to get my e-mail on it.
We are still getting acquainted...but.  so far. GREAT
"If all you want is a book reader, to view videos and surf this is great. If you looking for a tablet look elsewhere. Too proprietary."
"As a Prime member, I would love to buy just the basic black 8BG with the Prime deal but even though it is only 58% sold out, I can't get it to add to my cart."
Love it!  Great improvements from my older 1st generation Kindle Fire.
"love this, updated from the FIRST fire, this one rocks!"
LOVE my Kindle!
Excellent product
This kindle does everything and more I seriously couldn't be happier with it
"Purchased for my granddaughter after hers was stolen....she LOVES it, especially the camera...she's had a ball with it, it works great."
"I am beginning to use it more and more over other options.  My only complaint with this is that the battery seems to have a short charge life.  Twice when I've charged it for longer periods, I thought I might have to trash it but after charging again, it worked.  I was frustrated as I had only had it less than a month.  Right now, after a couple of months use, it seems to be working fine for the most part but not as reliable as my iPad.<br />I do like it though and find myself doing more and more things on it.  For the price I paid, I think I got a wonderful deal."
its great you got to get one!!
Once I found the operating instructions under the Help button everything went smoothly.
easy to use and really appreciated that the material that I had on my other Kindle transferred over without any problems
Wish I would have spent the extra $$ to get this without &#34;special offers&#34;.  What a pain!  I never pay any attention to them and it is one extra step to get to my dashboard.  Took a little getting used to as the icons and display are different than my old Kindle.  Still a good value for the price.
"Nice little tablet. Only downfall is, that it doesn't have a app for Vudu."
"Bought as replacement for original Kindle Fire.  More apps, great picture, love my Fire."
Better than I expected. Great quality! Works great.
LOVE IT!
My 1st Kindle (from about 3 years ago) was just not doing what I needed anymore.  Basically not enough room.  This new design took a little getting used to but I love it.  Much more functions than my previous one also.  I went with the upgraded memory option too.
"good tablet nice size, I am new to this but it is easy to use , I am still learning all it has to offer. Like the color also."
"The Kindle Fire HD 7 is very clear, easy to use, and has all features we expected. I would definitely recommend this good Amazon product."
Love it.  Great product. Works fantastic.
"I have had it about a month.  I use for reading and to get on Internet (Facebook, emails).  I like it and would recommend."
"I bought this to stop stealing the wife's Ipad.  This is just the right size for me.  I can check email and do web searches without any issues.  I got a great sale price on it too. If you plan to store more than one movie at a time or take a lot of photos, get the 16G or better."
"I really like so far,I'm still learning,ita a little different the my other one"
"Terrible charger...it charged the device one time. ONCE. And quit working. If you could send me one that works, I'd be glad to delete this review."
Great little tablet.
Easy to navigate and crystal clear to read.
I love my new Fire HD 7.
love my Fire
Great Carry It To Dr's Appts.
"The device totally freezes on me at times and will not respond to my touch.  It has to be turned off and turned back on. Also at times, it is very slow."
Camera could be better but everything else is very good.
Very happy with this purchase. Fits perfectly!
"Love my FireHD 7, so clear and sharp, love reading on it and playing games.  No other compares to this one. Thanks Amazon."
Great device- I still need to figure out how to download books on it- both from Amazon and from my public library.
As always I love the kindle fires. Meets all my expectations.
i love my kindle its so cool...i tend to use it at work as a distraction to have on while i work and it works fabulous.
Love it. Feels like cable t.v. but better.
This device is responsive and quick. I wish it had a little longer battery life. As it stands I am forced to take it out of the waterproof case I bought for it far too often for it be that useful for me.<br /><br />This is a good device for kids or as a starter tablet.
Glad I finally bought one
The tablet arrived on time...nicely packaged and ready to go out of the box.  I was confused by an add that seemed to be a requirement for me to accept before I could get any further in setting up the tablet<br />..it had to do with signing up for the &#34;prime membership&#34;...so I did and was able to finish the setup.  Later I got an e-mail telling me my prime membership was declined because I didn't provide a c.c. #  I've since learned how to click through the adds.  Other than the many adds...I've been very pleased with the tablet.
Pretty good for the price. My kids love the games and books on the free time feature. I'm an amazon prime member so I love the free book a month with lots of choices. I've only had this for a short time so I'm still learning some of the features. But so far I'm very happy with my selection.
"We'll develop tablet for kids, and it can handle abuse without a case but I recommend getting a case . my daughter will not put it down.  Great job kindle.."
It's good
Live it use about very day
My 4 year old Kindle Fire died and I was directed to this newer one by Amazon Customer Service. It is a major improvement over the original.
Loved it and had fast service!
There is no way to learn how to use but poke around.  The user guide should be printed and provided with the Fire. I am learning by poking around.Also disappointed by the battery life on a full charge. My paperwhite is much better. Screen is great except I have been unable to reverse the background from black to white.  How do you so that
"There is so much to learn about this item, but it has definitely outdone all my expectations so far.  I'm very impressed and delighted with it."
I am very happy with how well it fits and the keypad is raised which makes typing easy.
"bought this as a gift for my daughter, which she uses all the time. keeps her out of trouble."
"Perfect!!!  Absolutely the best posting photos, reading, music, games, apps, you name it!!  For the same features, the price canNOT be beat!!  I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a personal tablet."
"I love this!! Gorgeous color! Awesome music play!  Great books on tape, movies, etc."
"I should have ordered the case then instead of today. You really need the case to go outdoors and carry the devise around. I'm still learning how to use the thing, have yet to watch anything. Finally got the stylus to write more as my fingers are too fat for such little keys. Watched Rome."
This Kindle seems to have everything going for it! Stereo speakers are GREAT!!!!
I expected better sound and the battery life is low.
Love the Fire am having a problem hooking onto WiFI thru my Modem..should be solved tomorrow
"Love it, very easy to use."
Love it!
I bought the fire for my wife she truly loves it as she did her Kindle
"I am working with my local Technology 4 Tomorrow, and learning new skills everyday. Love my new Kindle Fire."
"Good product for a tablet, easy to carry and light weight.  It allowed me to establish security for each of my three grandchildren to keep them from buying products.  I can click on the profile and they're off and either reading or playing.  I like that some of the apps for 4-6 year olds will actually read the book to them.  What I constantly have to do is delete applications to limit the apps freezing and making us reboot the tablet.  And I have the larger amount of storage!  All in all, easy to switch from kindle to tablet when reading a book."
I don't know it well enough yet.
"This review gives 4 stars to the device, 3 to Amazon and 5 to the carrier Ontrac.<br />The device seems to work well and quite as expected, except for an endless loop on initial boot which was hard to break out of. So I guess it will continue to work as advertised.<br />But, it is a replacement for my 2012 HD7 which never worked properly due to continual system crashes and failures to restart. Always on charge to get around that, the battery predictably quit after two years. That one was purchased refurbished but no excuses for Amazon- no one wants a refurbished dud.<br />Ontrac seems to have brought the unit into my hand from Phoenix in nine hours. They always deliver at lightning speed and in this case it mattered because I had to leave town ten minutes later. I hope they get a copy of this."
My husband enjoys his Kindle Fire.  Loves playing games.
love my HD. the price was great and I love the color. its my own personal tablet
I love it!
"i was looking for a great small tablet and i found it...this holds my books, magazines, newspapers, movies and gmail, all in a compact little design and its super easy to setup and i use this more now even in my apartment as opposed to logging into my laptop. my only issue is when watching movies there is a glare off the screen and that anti-glare sheet for fire hd7 is horrible but other than that its great."
"I still HATE the silk browser -- wish I could choose an alternative especially as it will not display Flash (half the FB entries I see I can't view). Still wish there was a way to organize books and apps, especially a way to include descriptions if not a way to organize by, say, genre. And I also hate that in some Kindle books, the line height is not controllable -- should be standard for all books.<br /><br />That said, the screen resolution is good. It's light, and while the battery life sucks, it's a little better than the last version. I wish there was some way of seeing that the device is fully charge without having to turn it on (like the first Kindles)."
It needs a few simple starting instructions
I love it! It's perfect for me. I can read my books whenever and wherever but then I can also allow my 5 year old cousin to play games on it. I can get on social media and let everyone know about the wonderful books I'm reading. I can also download word documents and work/edit them and as an author that is a huge plus!
Perfect for kids!
Battery seems short lived compared my old fire.
This with Prime is the ticket! Rent a good movie for free is awesome. Rent a bad movie for free and I really don't care.
needs Flash player standard and speed of execution on certain apps is not that great?
The person that won this loves it
"Works great, love the control I have over what apps and content my kids see.  I'm an android person, and was nervous about an android tablet and Ipad's are expensive.  I am going to buy another one for my other daughter the next time they go on sale, but I will be buying the 16 gb version.  That is my only complaint, 8 gb is just not enough space.  I wish all phone/tablet makers would do this, if you're going to say it has 8GB of storage, give it enough so that there is 8 gb of storage AFTER the OS and all your standard apps are installed.  Memory isn't that expensive...  would be 5 stars if it had more usable space."
Great item!
I am very satisfied.
"Love it! Actually does more than my nexus 7.. that quit working. Would not trade it, its great!!"
Bought this for my son for his 9th birthday. He loves it!
I returned it
"I am super satisfied with this,it's the best yet."
I love it! It is more than I expected!!!
This is my second Kindle.  I have worn out a NOOK and a Kindle with my excessive reading.  So much easier then a paperback or hard back book to read. I like being able to check my FB and other things too.
I love my Kindle Fire HD7. This is my first Kindle and I find it to be very user friendly. I use it mostly for reading and I am not at all disappointed in my purchase.
"It's manufactured poorly,is very delicate, and  I will declare  the T.V. commercial as well as the Amazon site commercial (both have been discontinued) as false advertising. The ad showed an Amazon Kindle Fire tablet flying off the top of a moving vehicle and crashing to the pavement.The driver stopped the car and the dismayed child discovered that his forgotten Kindle Fire Tablet sustained no damage!!!! The Kindle Fire Tablet is INDESTRUCTIBLE. It was not protected with a case and screen protector. However,it was not broken. Foolishly thinking the Kindle Fire will withstand any handling, I purchased a $30 screen protector and the Kindle Fire H.D Tablet  for my Grandson's birthday present. A friend bought a protective case for the Kindle.When the gifts were opened, the screen protector and case were put on the tablet. My Grandson was so surprised and immediately declared himself &#34; the happiest boy in the world&#34;.Two days later he dropped his case/screen protected Kindle on the carpet. The screen shattered and pieces of the plastic  Kindle cracked. Amazon refused to replace the Kindle. (April 2015)"
Commercial shows a fire flying off a van unto a cement driveway and everything's ok.  In real life a drop from 2.5 ft and the screen shattered.  Amazon of course says tough luck.  Don't waste your money.
"The battery life is frustrating. If I had known this, I wouldn't have purchased it. I have gone back to my old device.<br />A fix for the battery should be forthcoming."
Its easy to use and does the things I need
"We love the Kindle Fire and got it as a first tablet for our kiddo.  I love the parental controls and time limits.  However, the &#34;Special Offers&#34;  are not appropriate for kids.  I have a filter on, but they are still not kid friendly.  They are not removable from the lock screen unless you pay the $15, which made the original price a &#34;sale price.&#34;  It was not as good a deal as I had thought, now I need to pay and have them removed....."
"I love❤️❤️❤️ My Fire HD Kindle By Amazon👍🏼 I am totally a Amazon Girl😊 I've been reading so many books on my new Fire HD Kindle. I love the color, quality and the different things you can do with it: Like browsing the Internet, checking your emails, listening to music and taking pictures. I totally recommend purchasing this product. Received product on time, securely packed and I've had no issues whatsoever. Definitely a Five Star 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Rating👍🏼😊"
"I am thrilled with my new Fire HD 7. It is so much fun! I am still learning, but finding new things each day!"
This belongs to my Grand daughter!!!
I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it and I hope to buy one for myself at some point fairly soon as well.
Nice little tablet easy to read and light weight
"Love it!!! Easy to use, great picture, and it makes me happy. 😊😊"
My 9 yr absolutely loves it !!!
"Initially I liked the device.  Very user friendly.  It would not turn on after 2 days of minimal use.  It may have been an isolated occurrence, however 1 star reviews, show that there may be reliability issues with the power supplies.  If purchased you may want to consider an extended warranty."
this is my 2nd Kindle ordered from Amazon. My daughter ordered the first and I ordered the second.  I was pleased with the handling of my order and the promptness In which I received it.
"I have been a fan of the Kindle, and purchased this one in November 2013 as an upgrade from the previous model.  I constantly had problems with it spontaneously powering off even though it was nearly fully charged.  In just a little over a year, February 2015, it no longer would no longer charge and turn on.  I am disappointed that my older Kindle Fire &#34;out lived&#34; the newer one."
Works great
"The Fire HD 7, 7&#34; display exceeded my expectations. I am very pleased with my purchase. It was a great value for the price."
"Love it!  Nice little tablet at a great price!  I can even print to my wireless printers from here - effortlessly!  It found my printers right away!  No work needed!  Great for small business owners, like myself, who need to &#34;check in&#34; on orders, emails, messages, etc - on the go!  Great picture and sound too - for watching those movies while waiting in the airport!  I'll be looking at buying more of these for gifts!"
"After doing some research and comparing different tablets, I opted to purchase The Kindle Fire.  This is my first tablet and I am impressed with it.  I am an avid reader and honestly that is the main reason I bought a tablet; so much easier to carry around than books.  It pretty much set itself up once I removed it from the box and I was set to go!  I downloaded some apps and synced my email, along with downloading books.  It's great at night, I can browse the internet, check email and Facebook, play games and read, all without disturbing my husband.  It seems to run fast and I have had no issues with it since it arrived."
I love it. Don't know why I waited so long to get it!!
"Best ever for the price.  However, it would be good if the apps didn't come simply from Playstore which I think it does and only had those that work properly with the Kindle."
I love it partner threatens that its going to come up missing one night.
"This the worse ever don't waist your money, is the second replacement I buy 2 are doing the same, shame.deleting for 2 day never end I just trying to deleting one picture, battery last 30 minutes shame and brake easy even with cover"
"My rating is incomplete as I am still getting acquainted with this product.  For persons with digital savvy, this might be a breeze.  For me it is a slog, so this a getting acquainted phase.  It may be a wonderful tool when I know how to get it to do what I need."
battery doesn't last and it isn't as intuitive as some other tablets I have used.
Love my new kindle it has a bigger screen now and really cool features for books like highlighted sections
I love the Kindle Fire.  My old kindle broke and I wanted another simple one.  My mom got me the Fire which I thought was way too fancy.  But now I love it.  I have enjoyed downloading music and videos as well as books.  I highly recommend this.
"This was a birthday gift for my husband who is a game addict....he loves it...chess, cards, cribbage, and more, all day, anywhere!"
Love it...
"I'm coming to this tablet from an ipad. My ipad was getting old so an upgrade was needed. I choose the fire HD 7 due to the price and my constant amazon ordering. I do buy books and audio books too. So it seemed a natural fit and I'm really happy with it. Everything is working as planned and I find the screen really nice and responsive. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, was for the batter life. Again, I'm comparing it to an ipad, but I need to charge the Fire everyday. Not a big pain because I charge my phone everyday too. I'm worried if I go camping (or anywhere I don't have easy power access) I might have issues."
Meets expectations.
It is all that I have ever asked for plus the size is perfect to fit into my purse easily and it is light.  The best thing about it is that it is far less expensive then other tablets including the I-pad.
"So far so good, keep it up!!"
"Who doesn't LOVE their Kindle. I use this device for everything...browsing the web through the super cool Silk browser, scrolling Facebook, taking pictures, playing games, entertaining my child if the need arises, etc. I would recommend a Fire tablet to anyone and everyone!"
I love it........I have bought three other Kindle products.....also PaperWhite........wonderful products.........
"I love it! If I had known it was so versatile, I would have purchased one much sooner!"
It is my fault because I am 80 years old I have no sight in one eye and w2ith the right one I can see everything but I cannot read anything and the printing is so small I can not read it even with my manifying glass. Sorry
Love the upgraded features and larger screen.  Great purchase!
"I got this for Christmas, and yesterday, (July 10, 2015) it died. Won't charge, won't come on. NOTHING!"
Own 3 of these - this one is a gift - haven given it yet-
Love it!
Great
Easy to set up and use. Love the size
Great savings here for this item but still must rove case yo charge why?
Love it
I've always been used to books and paper but have been getting acquainted with electronic devices this past year.  I just recently received this for my birthday and I'm enjoying its features and capabilities. There are some apps on our tablet that aren't available on my kindle even though it is a good Android operating system.
"The picture is brilliant! I really enjoy watching movies on it. I love the added features in the reading section as well. I love how much information can be found before even reading the book. I wish it held a charge longer, or had a rapid charger, but I love my Kindle!!!"
I'm enjoying Fire HD 7.
Had to get a replacement.  I could not find my first one that I had had for over three years.
"Just received it, so far so good."
"Love,LOVE....did I mention LoVe it?"
Love it! I can do most any of the stuff I usually do from my laptop!
good
Works great Thank you.
"I had an old Kindle 6&#34;, & now I have the new Fire HD. This one has different features than the 6&#34;, but I do like the HD Fire 7&#34;."
"Great product, my son said &#34; I loving this thing&#34;..."
Love the size. The lighted screen...the color.  It has been such a great improvement over the original kindle we bought years ago!
This was a perfect gift for my 74 year old husband. It is not difficult to figure out how to work.
Very easy to read.
"I absolutely love my new Kindle Fire! It's very pretty, light to hold, and the clarity is amazing compared to my older Fire. I am very happy with the new 4th Generation Kindle Fire HD 7."
It is great.
Love the fire HD7&#34;
The product is great. Just be aware that there is a charger packed in the box inside what looks like a spacer. I've thrown out a charger without knowing it was there. Be sure to open everything in the box.
Seems rugged enough. Picture is very good.
Kids love it.
I like how the on and off button is different than the sound buttons.
enjoy it very much quick downloads and easy to read screen.
Love it
"I had a Kindle Fire which I happily gifted to my 7 year old daughter for her reading experience and then I upgraded to the Fire HD.<br /><br />The Fire HD is faster and the Sangria OS is very user-friendly with lots of new additions and I especially love the family library and easy family sharing options.<br /><br />I got the 7 inch and 16 GB storage which I know was the better option since 8 GBs of storage can really go very fast. It's also affordable. :-)<br /><br />Personally, the Kindle Fire HD is a excellent buy for a great reader's experience. Besides when you've experience a Kindle, there is no going back. :-)"
Navigation is not intuitive. Hard to use. Downloaded prime videos delete after watching once. Not enough memory to be useful.
"Love it,would go bats without it  Rich"
"I was very happy initially with this kindle. The suddenly, it stopped working. I tried charging it....nothing. The charger works for other things and the outlet works fine so that wasn't the problem. I tried a hard reset....nothing. I even tried charging it over night thinking the battery was just really dead...nothing. The kindle is completely unresponsive and the reason is a total mystery. This is the 2nd kindle in a row that quit working after just a few months of use...very disappointed."
Love it it's my third one best of all
I just enjoy this no end. All I've done is read books. Still to come...games and WIFI.
"This was to replace my old Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD. The old one lasted me through probably a thousand books, so looking forward to the next thousand!"
Very sleek form easy to use bright colors.
It was good while it lasted
I like it better then the other kindle that I had there's more room the screen is more clear and their is a lot more features
sent it back...
I've had it 6 months and I still can't sign in. Wish I had a Samsung.
A winner! Love it and the price. Rivals my wife's Ipad at one firth the price. Problem: my wife is now reading a book on it. Says the Ipad is too heavy. so when do I get my kindle Fire 7&#34; HD back?
"While the size of the onboard storage was known, the actual usable amount is substantially less and I was disappointed that there was no option for expansion for long unconnected trips. The unit itself has performed well otherwise and the speaker and screen quality are great."
Looks great.
Has met expectations at a great price!
"This was a gift, so I didn't pick it out.  My previous cover I was able.to rotate the kindle, and it had grooves where I could set the kindle at different angles in a vertical or horizontal position.  This cover doesn't allow the kindle to stay open, unless I hold it..."
This is my first tablet and so far I am very happy with it.
For the money.. This tablet rocks..awesome speed and graphics.<br />Love Prime Instant Video on this device!
"I really didn't use this that much when I first got it, but then I started to watch Boardwalk Empire, and ROME , and soon discovered one of the very good ways to use the FIRE HD. I search the web too, but I'd have to say I use this mostly for entertainment. Very nice. Great visual acuity, and great sound."
"I'm an owner of the very first Fire which I still love and use.  However, I needed to be able to store movies etc for use off wifi (e.g., for movies while flying) so I bought this fire when I saw it on sale.  Most of my issues with the new Fire results from differences between it and my old Fire.  The one thing I really hate is the new way of exiting an application which requires one to make swipes to bring up the back and home button.  In the first fire that was always there."
I like the Fire 7 but wish it held it charge longer.  Even when off the battery loses power.  I may be doing something right.  Need to learn more about operating the Fire HD 7.
This is my fifth kindle and I am always reading one of them.
"Although I love my older version of a Kindle Fire, the screen is sharper and more vivid. The battery is a bit better as far as run down time, but I do wish they would hint what covers fit so when I ordered it I could have had a cover right away with it, not have to go through pages of covers to find one I liked & would fit. Come on Amazon, get on the ball."
"Having fun with Fire HD, 7 learning something new everyday."
can't beat it for the price.
I like it a lot but always liked the kindle.  Iam also enjoying the camera nice feature.
Exelent
So far so good.
Love it ...great tool
"I'm able to download and read some books, but there are several quirks that there is no manual to explain.<br />And I'm not able to change Bible references nearly so well as I can do it with a printed version."
I bought this for my 6 year old daughter and it had been a great investment. Road trips are better. Its been used more then her Ipad.
"I'm still learning how to use it, but have been able to surf the web, play games, read a book and check my facebook already and am enjoying using it. This is a good size too. Not too big to hold onto, but small enough not to get hot or be heavy. I'm very pleased with my kindle"
"My second Kindle I've purchased. It's a great tablet, and the color. Upgraded a little bit from the last one, and very happy I did."
The only issue I have with my new Kindle Fire 7 is that it takes too long to boot up.  My old one(the original Kindle Fire)  booted up much quicker.  Other than that it works well.
"A very good tablet, not perfect but I really enjoy it."
Nice.  A little complicated compared to iPad.  Difficult to change profiles.  Battery dies quick.
I originally purchased the very first Kindle Fire that came out and loved it. This one was purchased after that one broke. This Kindle is very nice but I can't give it 5 stars because it feels a bit cheaper than the one I previously owned. Also the home screen and key board are very plain. I also really hate how on the lock screen there are advertisements. I find it so ridiculous that you pay so much for a tablet and find advertisements for Lysol and Huggie diapers. If there is a way to turn them off I haven't found it yet.<br />Over all the Kindle is fine for what I need it for.
works good
"This works as expected. We like the syncing between this device and the reading apps which we use on a Samsung tablet. As long as we are connected to Wi-Fi, our bookmarks and highlights transfer right over. Nice. We also like the assortment of free books!"
"The battery life is awful, barely makes a few hours.  Processor slow.  However, clarity is great, easy to watch movies on and read.  A bit heavy compared to other Kindles."
Really slow and aggravating. The only thing that works properly is the reader. And even that malfunctions. I would have returned it but I lost the receipt.
"Everything I expected and, more. An amazing tablet for reading, mail and news, etc."
Overall it's a good tablet but it has a lot of glitches. It freezes from time to time and takes me away from a page that I was reading out of the nowhere. I don't like the advertisement screen saver which you can't even change. I wish it would allow you to personalize it more.
GREAT TABLET!!!!!! Enough said.
I am very happy with it<br />Tanja
"After watching me with my kindle, my husband thought he needed one. He loves it, was easy for him to learn to use.  Thanks amazon."
I'm always amazed by Kindle Products. I was fortunate to get the first model and have been fortunate to upgrade to the Fire HD7. I use it at night to watch movies without disturbing my wife's sleep.
"I originally purchased the gen 6.  I LOVED IT.  But, my daughter broke it.  It was not under warranty so my husband being the wonderful man he is bought the Gen7.  It has been a nightmare.  They are now sending me my third device, which is supposed to be here today, so hopefully it will be the charm.  I want to give higher marks because I loved my first Kindle.  Here is to hoping."
Came on time and works well.  a good dealr
Very happy with the Kindle Fire. It's everything I wanted and more.
"The Fire is turning out to be all it claims to be. The images are crisp, it's fast and relatively easy to use. (I say relatively because I am 67 years old and come from an era when instructions came with everything.) Today we are expected to already know how to use the newest electronics. I've had a Nexus 7 for over a year now and had to buy a 'Nexus 7 for Dummies' book just to be able to use it. The Fire is either less complicated or I've been forced to learn thanks to the Nexus.<br />My main reason for buying the Fire was the camera. My Nexus 7 could be used for Skype but not for taking photos. With the Fire I can do both. Also I should mention, the price was right."
"Being my first tablet, I am enjoying it very much....would recommend for beginners and seasoned as well."
Fantastic! I love everything about it!
Love it!
I really love it
LOVE IT!!!
I like it very much especially now that for some reason my laptop will no longer connect to the internet.
Love it use it all the time
Good
Great tablet.
A+++ What can I say? Amazing!!!
Love my Fire. Is better than I expected. Was reluctant to buy one but decided to try. Glad I did. Like it better than my iPad.
haven't read the  books yet
Bought as a gift for my mom and she loves it.
good fro grandma who reads
"This surpassed my expectations.  The battery life is great, and I'm loving the upgrade from my previous Kindle Fire. It is a wonderful, relatively inexpensive tablet...perfect for me!"
grandson loves it I've bought 4 of these never any problems
"I've only had the Fire HD for two weeks or so.  I'm still in the learning process.  It's up to three stars because of the ease of finding programs.  If I have had any issues I can find out how to fix them readily in the user manual that is installed on the unit.  I don't expect the rating to go down, only up.  I gave my grandson one for Christmas and he can help me use  it."
Great product.
"Overall, this device is superior to my five-year-old Nook. My one complaint is that I want more flexibility in organizing my books. I'd like to create categories (or shelves) into which I can move books, rather than merely creating links.<br />It would be useful to have a built-in utility to convert books from other formats to MOBI.<br />The typing setup is better than the Nook's.<br />The reading aids (X-Ray, dictionary, etc.) are also better than the Nook's."
"Disappointed!!!!  I like it well enough and enjoy all it's features!!  However, I replaced a kindle with this and am extremely disappointed that I can not sit outside to read or work on it or take pictures also.  Too much glare on the screen even when setting in shade."
Like it but am still learning about it.  I use it for reading for the most part.  It's small and convenient to take with me.
"The battery doesn't last nearly as long as my older version Kindle and items are slow to load. It turns off my wifi without my involvement far too often. Doesn't lose it's connection, it actually turns off the wifi on the device between uses of the device. Very annoying! I'm already tired of the ads and am now thinking the 1-2 month waiting period to pay extra for one without ads would have been worth it. I feel forced to have bought one with the ads because of the waiting period that doesn't make sense. Otherwise it's nice and has much improved features."
Works better than expected
Really awesome I like my fire HD a while lot
I love using my fire he . This is my first tablet.
"Bought this for my hubby.  His remarks: wants more features with camera and video, but enjoys having it in this version as opposed to the original kindle fire."
Would have given it 5 stars but the battery life isn't what I thought it would be. Otherwise I love my new kindle!
I was old school and wanted to read real books.  So happy I was talked into buy this.  It saves so much time and money of buying them or going to the library.  I read constantly now.  Should've gotten this a long time ago!  Also easier to read than a book with the lit background.
"Great for reading. Functional for the kids app. Clear picture. Good size. I docked one star because of ease of use, kids still need help navigating to their pagee."
This Fire HD 7 does everything I expected at an economical price!
having lots of fun with it. would recommend this
"I really like AMAZON products. They're user friendly, high quality, and budget friendly. I love AMAZON. The screen is perfect size with crystal clear picture. quick touch response. Fast processor. a great product over all."
I like it but I wished it had a port to add more gig.  I also want to be able to use internet on it where wifi is not available.
I can't Bluetooth anything to it and the Wi-Fi connection is ridiculously slow. I've tried restarting and reconnecting it but it still doesn't help.
"Like it much.  Dis shut down on its own a couple of times, also locked up while plaing games."
"Let me start by saying that I LOVE my 2nd generation Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. THIS particular generation, however, is only so-so, in my opinion.<br /><br />I got the second one as a gift to my young son. At first glance, I loved it. I thought I loved the new operating system style. The fact that you can log in from the start screen, having separate accounts, including freetime accounts was a great touch! I was a bit jealous of his new kindle!<br /><br />But, after a few days, I realized that this new system took up a LOT more space, leaving this kindle advertised as &#34;8 gigabytes&#34;, but really only having 4.5 gigs left for user content. That is a -massive- operating system for a tablet! That not only cripples the space of this kindle, but also seems to lag more than my 2nd gen, despite the fact that current generation boasts of a better processing speed!<br /><br />To me, it's similar to a leap from Windows XP to Windows 8. Sure, it looks flashy, and makes some things easier, but it's also bulky (with both HD and processing requirements) and has it's issues. In the end, I'd prefer XP and the 2nd gen Kindle Fire to Windows 8 and this current Kindle generation."
great
Great device
Excellent product
"Missing access to  really basic apps like YouTube. Also, I keep running into apps in their own  Appstore that run on other Android devices, but can't be installed on the Fire."
"I was so excited to purchase this kindle and I was not disappointed when it arrived! The picture quality is high definition and crystal clear. The processor is speedy and the touch screen is accurate when using the keyboard. My only reason for giving it four stars instead of five is because the app store does not offer as many apps as Apple or Android device's. I wish there were more apps available, but hopefully there will be in the near future!"
I am extremely pleased with my purchase
"I really, really like my Kindle Fire HD 7! The tablet that I had before I purchased my Fire was totally WORTHLESS!!! It crashed frequently. When it would crash it would actually shut down and then I would have to repeatedly push the power button to make it turn on. I have had my Kindle Fire HD 7 for about a month and I can tell you it was well worth the money. The processor in this tablet is fast which means that apps open fast. It has not crashed even once in the month that I have had it. It gets a lot of use and has been totally reliable to this point. This tablet is also great for listening to music. I use headphones when I listen to music and the sound is just incredible. The only minor complaint that I have is that there are a few google apps that I had on my other tablet that I cannot download on my Kindle Fire."
Seems like a great product.  Unfortunately we decided to return it since it does not run Android apps and we have so many favorites we've already purchased through the Google Play store that my kids would be upset to lose and that I do not want to have to re-purchase through Amazon.
Love it!
"I love my Kindle Fire! It's really fast compared to my laptop. My laptop is constantly getting updates and hanging up and Firefox crashes all the time so I use my Kindle Fire for almost everything now. I only really use my laptop for running programs that can't be installed on a tablet. I also got the Poetic case for it and it works beautifully. I use a lot of coupons for craft stores and now I don't need to print them out. I can save pages from the web with the coupon in my reading list and take them with me without having to be connected to the internet. I got the one with special offers and I'm not bothered by the the adds, it's very quick to just swipe by or close them, easier than on the regular web adverisments. I'm very happy with my purchase."
We really like this new Kindle Fire HD.  It has numerous entertaining & educational programs. It easy to find certain websites on the App carousel. Really enjoy watching movies or TV shows on this tablet. A great deal and they improved the quality of this Kindle Fire HD. It's easy to handle & much stronger than my last one. I really recommend this tablet. Really glad I purchased this amazing HD tablet.
"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter, who we just learned has dyslexia. I was specifically interested in the &#34;immersion reading&#34;. With it, you can use the kindle and audible versions of a book together, so that while you are reading, the audible version is playing...plus, the kindle highlights what is being read by audible. Within a few days, my daughter read her first chapter book cover to cover! Seeing her excited to read made this purchase completely worth it! As she heads to middle school, with increased reading demands, I think this will be an invaluable resource for our family!"
Love it
Okay so we have a Kindle fire HD 1st 2nd and now this is a 4th generation. I must say we like the 1st and 2nd generation must better.. This one seems so light weight and cheaply made.. the battery life is not even as up to par as the 1st and 2nd generation It does not last even half as long. It seems to get warm/hot unlike the other ones we own for some reason.  Its not as user friendly The settings are completely different! Had I known all of this before I purchased it I would have got an older one. My daughter and myself ( I have a degree in computer science so I am very tech savy)  are having issues with this one  I guess because we are so used to using the 1st and 2nd generation tablets. I am very disappointed in this Fire HD.
Love this Kindle with the bigger screen.
"I really liked my new Kindle Fire....until it crashed two months later. I had 77% power when I turned it off and six hours later I could not turn it back on. Charging did not work, holding the power button, nothing. I spent an evening with Amazon Kindle support on the phone and they were absolutely no help. They just told me there was nothing they could do. Now I am told by Amazon that I have to wait 5-6 weeks for a replacement because they are so popular and are backordered. Not real impressed with Kindle or Amazon...."
I really enjoy reading on the Fire HD 7.  It has great color.
"I should have done more research before I bought this thing.  Not one of the apps I regularly use are compatible with the Kindle, while the same apps work perfectly on my cheap little no contract Windows phone.  I am really disappointed with the Kindle.  I bought it for the supposed perks my library card doesn't offer, but it turns out there aren't any."
"I am disappointed in my Kindle fire, given to me by my daughter for Mother's day.  I can be reading it and without touching anything, the print will go from vertical to horizontal and back and  forth several times before it stabilizes for a few moments before doing it again. Also, it is frequently difficult to retrieve the books that are in my  library.  I hate having to turn on my Wi-Fi  just to retrieve a book.<br /><br />I have macular degeneration, so I do love the lighted background.<br /><br />I am almost ninety years old and am not the most savvy with electronic gadgets, so I probably should not evaluate the Kindle Fire.  Perhaps I should buy another old Kindle!  Are they still available?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Margaret Vermillion"
"So I'm not a big Tec person. I still have things to figure out. My wife is an apple person so it's fun to see the differences between the two. So l'm hooked on the system. Good size, great  clarity, easy to set up.  Wrote this review on it. There is a lot of glare out side or in sunlight"
HARD TO MANAGE I SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY GALAXY TABLEET.... INSTEAD I BORUGHT THIIS.... UGHFHRFHFHFHF
Love it
I love this Kindle Fire HD. It was so easy to use. I just turned it on and it guided me through the process.
It is great
"I love this, It's better than I expected...Great quality and durable. I would highly recommend this tablet.."
"I found it hard to figure out how to work, not like a computer. Amazon oriented...wish I just got a tablet."
"I love this tablet, it is fantastic!  I can do so many things on it.  This is one purchase I am very pleased with."
My new fire is great. I am so pleased with the speed and resolution. This is my 3rd kindle. I had an original with keyboard then upgraded to the 1st gen fire. That fire died after almost 3 years so I decided on the HD. I upgraded to 16 GBP and I'm glad I did. I can use it more as a tablet than just as an e reader. I will.continue to own kindle.
When watching movies you miss some wording and actions because screen is small. Pictures not as good as an iPhone. However overall it is a great small tablet. I use it for about everything
Exactly what I was looking for.
Difficult to navigate versus my original Kindle.
Great!
I have many kindles. I started with the original and have slowly worked my way up into this one. I thought I would really miss the feel of a book but I don't. I still read certain books in paper form. It is so easy to purchase books on the kindle. No matter where I am I can buy a book if I have an Internet connection. (Not always a good thing financially!  Lol). I have Amazon prime so I get pretty good deals on books. My parents who are in their late 60s have taken over my earlier versions and they play a lot of scrabble and solitaire as well as read. I bought this particular model just so my mom could have my original fire. I love the camera on this and that had made the purchase more than worth my while. I highly recommend a kindle to anyone who loves to read and this particular model for anyone who loves to take pictures and videos.
Love it!
enjoy it
love it
Bought for my mom. She had the first generation Kindle fire. She loves her new one!
"LIKE THAT IT IS SO SMALL, THAT WAY YOU CAN TUCK IT IN A SMALL PURSE OR BAG.  EASY TO USE"
Love my new Kindle!
I love the fire HD don't want to put it down...
I love my fire! It does what I need it to do. I don't like the update but what can I do. I only use it for reading and facebook and it performs well enough for thatm
I'm sure the device is just fine.  The problem is the user.  I find it confusing and perplexing and not easy to use.
Love it! Everything I thought is would be and more.
great still trying ti figure all I can do with it
Product was as described loved it!!!!
has made college less of a hassle buying books
"Love the kindle and love the color! My only complaint is that I own the Fire HDX 8.9 as well, and it's battery lasts SOOOO much longer than this one, and that makes no sense! This one drains really fast, and for no reason, even when not in use. I may return to see if this is a batter issue."
Once you get past that Amazon and Google are not in love - the Kindle experience is wonderful! Amazon features likes books and music are excellent and this tablet is still Android through and through so there is still enough Google familiarity to make this tablet a great experience. I can set my phone aside at evening at home now and enjoy social media and other apps and entertainment on the beautiful 7 inch display of my Kindle.
Kids seem to love it.
I bought this for my wife as a gift because I heard so many good things about it and everyone was correct bought how good of a product it was because she loves it  the tablet doe's everything it was as advertised..to do and more.
Love Kindle products.  We are brand loyal.
Much better than I thought it would be.
Charge port too small!!
my 5 and 10 year old love their Fire HD 7.
I have a Kindle Fire. The one with live customer service. I love it; so I bought this one for a gift for my Mom. She loves it. It is a great value for the price. We love our Kindles!
Just in time and what I wanted.
my grandson love it he play all the time and i love it to
The Fire HD only has enough battery to run for about one and a half to two hours of continuous use. I thought it would last longer. I can't play some of my favorite games because Fire HD doesn't support java.
"We now own 4, Kindle Fire 7,7&#34; Display, Wi-Fi. The 8 GB s perfect for my mom who reads books, e-mails, and Facebooks!"
"I've had this over a week now, and for most part, I really love it. However, it CRASHES CONSTANTLY- especially when I'm reading Daily Mail, and ALWAYS decline Amazon's app for it, which I've tried, and do NOT like.  Often, Facebook app experiences same problem of &#34;Tab Unexpectedly Expired&#34;. It's extremely frustrating. Something I should be able to read in 5 minutes or less, often takes MUCH longer, due to this. So, I'm NOT lovin it. New one CRASHES almost as much as my old, worn out one. So, either I am the UNSATISFIED owner of a defective unit, or it's retaliation for my REFUSING apps I HATE and DON'T want. If it gets any better, I'll update this.   AUGUST 21ST UPDATE: This is the 3d kindle in roughly 6weeks! The 1 I originally ordered that this UNHAPPY review was the cause of, had to be returned 1week after I received it, due to its CONSTANT CRASHING. The replacement arrived, and at 1st, it seemed like it was fine. NOPE! After spending about a month trying to get it to work PROPERLY, I gave in and called Amazon on Wed/Aug19th, and a VERY helpful fella named Paul decided that too is defective. Returned it Th/Aug20th, and today THIS one arrived. We'll give it time, see how it goes.   Every kindle I've EVER purchased has come with a charger. Including the 2 defective ones. THIS particular kindle came ONLY with the USB port. When I called customer service, I was informed they've NEVER come with a charger!! BULLPUKKEY!! I was definitely NOT happy being told this, and I asked for, and got, a higher up to aid me. The little box that plugs INTO the wall AND kindle so it can be fed, is the RIDICULOUS PRICE of $19.99, plus tax,s&h!! He took off the $19.99 charge, but the shipping was just under $14.00!! I pitched a MAJOR fit, as BOTH kindles I'd just returned came WITH the ENTIRE chargers!! I SHOULD be receiving the new charger(aka:ADAPTER)within a week, and with NO charges for it. WHERE was PAUL when I needed-and ASKED for him- as I'd been instructed??   If THIS 3dkindle has ANY technical difficulties due to being DEFECTIVE, I'm DEFINITELY returning it and getting a refund, which I will then use to purchase a BETTER product locally, such as a SAMSUNG GALAXY!!!   THANK you AMAZON for an incredibly DIFFICULT, STRESSFUL,AND THOROUGHLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE TODAY👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹   SAT8/22/15-THANK YOU AMAZON for replacing my NEW, DEFECTIVE KINDLE with a REFURBISHED DEFECTIVE KINDLE!!!! MAYBE I'll get LUCKY, and receive a BRAND-NEW, NON-DEFECTIVE KINDLE when it ARRIVES ON SEPTEMBER 10th!!!   I KNEW I should HAVE just bought the SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB to begin with. LAST CHANCE TO GET IT RIGHT AMAZON!!!👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹"
"This is a great tablet. I wouldn't want anything else. The only trouble I've had with it is finding some attachable handles for reading, because it's a little heavy and uncomfortable to hold after awhile, and the only handles I could find were for different tablets. It's a little more difficult to navigate the software than an Apple product, which I am used to, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly, and would recommend it to anyone for your size needs between a phone and a laptop!"
"Bulky device compared to others.  Could only have a few apps open before one would crash.  User interface was very bloated, and not intuitive.  I could not install most of the apps I use on other Android devices.  Ads were annoying.  I returned it and bought a galaxy tab A, which has been much more user friendly, and has no trouble running my apps."
"Can't beat the value you get for the price. I gave it 4/5 because the case feels cheap and the camera sucks. But i didnt get it for those reasons so im ok with it. For 100 bucks i can watch movies from anywhere, connect to my media server, browse the web, email, etc. its a good deal."
"It's very nice, I love the color.  Every thing works great except sometimes when I turn it on I have to press the button numerous times."
Is just what I wanted
"Very hard to get used to at first since I only used a PC.  I'm getting there.  It was a gift.  Still haven't figured out how to email<br />stuff to myself.  Need to study up on that.  Also it's big to hold.  Awkward.  Fine if can set it down on something and use it.<br />Since I have no other Smart Phone, etc. experience, this is okay.  I do like the camera aspect as the screen is nice and large and<br />easy to see."
"So much faster than my first generation Kindle. Love the color, the speed and the size."
I absolutely love my kindle. The graphics are great. And it's easy to understand.
"Not sure why I thought it had built in Wi-Fi and I could just connect anytme, anywhere but I was wrong.  Orther than that it has been a great device so far."
Purchased for my husband. He loves it.
I always wanted one and now I finally got it and I love it... I'm on it for hours sometimes. .. The best item I bought in a long time...
"Got it one week ago. Really enjoyed it and everything runs very smoothly so far. I guess the only problem I have is just you cannot re-name those files you downloaded online from the tablet itself ( yeah you definitely can change their name through connected computer). Other than this small problem, I love the machine. Quite a good one designed for basic tablet users."
Works great. Easy to use.
great kindle for the kids
I love my new Kindle 7&#34; HD.  I had an earlier version that was stolen earlier this year.  So glad to be able to read again!
Works Great
This is my second Kindle fire - the first one only lasted 17 months but I really love having the books so available with the kindle.  However I really think they should last much longer.  I have had my Apple Ipad for over 3 years with no problems but I do not like the size of the Ipad for reading.
"Great price, convenient size, and very reliable. Definitely would purchase again"
Love it
"My tablet was slow, touch screen took several times to register, it was slow processing and it would close out of the applications I had open."
"I like it but, I am having to get used to the OS."
It won't stay connected to my wifi
"Fantastic, no issues here."
"Battery dies faster than expected, but otherwise it's good"
My 6 year old uses well independently
"I'm on my 2nd one. The first must have been faulty from the factory because it just didn't work. But I seem to have the same volume issue with the 2nd as I did my first, the volume goes in and out while your streaming anything with sound. Super annoying, you have to close the app your on, and then reopen it with hopes of it actually working... I was so excited to upgrade from my nook to the kindle... Not that impressed. It's a shame too."
excelente product
This IS is the best product Amazon makes. Completely 'as advertised'.
Easy to get started and navigate.
"Very pleased with the product, received as ordered and very quickly."
A great machine....does all it advertises.
Yay
I enjoy this tablet. The price was right and my daughter enjoys watching prime kid tv shows on it.
I connected this to my Wi-Fi network and it works all over the living room and dining room.
"My daughter and I bought this Kindle for her. She helped pay for it with money from her first job. She used it for about a week before I realized that 8 GB is not enough memory. While I love the Kindle as a tablet, I would never have encouraged her to invest in a product that has to be replaced in a year. I would recommend just buying the 16GB."
"The Kindle is like part of my body, LOVE it!!!!!!"
"Awesome tablet purchased as a gift for my 14yr old, she loves to read Kindle on it"
"Very disappointed that amazon does not allow use of google apps, or at least google chromecast.  I was not looking to be caught in a fight between chromecast and firestick.  If I were looking for proprietary I would buy apple (yuck )"
"I bought 3 of these for my kids. After about a month and half of use, they were totally shot. That said, Amazon was fair in issuing a refund."
Thanks.  Service was great:)
"Love the kindle fire, the parent control features are perfect. I ordered this for my 4 year old and 6 year old to share and loaded it up with learning apps for them and books for me.  I am enjoying the free prime and great customer support."
Love it. Very user friendly and the screen size is good for me.
I don't know how to get started
I would have liked it better if there were instuctions on the use of it. Now I will have to wait for someone to show me how to use it.
clarity is beautiful..just wish the screen was a little bigger...
"Great tablet. We use it for the whole family and it works great. The only thing I wish is that when you have a child's profile it would let you access more than just Free Time, I would like to download games from the app store as well and not just ones off of that. Thats really my only complaint on the tablet."
Good Product
"Nice display. Not too big or heavy to carry around easily. Works well, especially for kindle apps, videos, books, etc."
"What can I say, this Kindle does what I need it to do and is a cool bright color :) I'm not a technical person but I use this mainly for apps and the occasional browsing online. Got it at a good price."
"This product has went above and beyond my expectations!  I have a Nook as well, which I do love, however, the Kindle provides a more tablet feel, brighter colors and of course you have so many titles to choose from with Kindle Unlimited.  I'm sold that this is the best ereader on the market, especially being a owner of the two leading brands."
Still learning on all the uses but am enjoying it very much.
"OMG, how did I ever live without this?<br />The size is awesome, fits right into my bag. Practically indestructible (I have dropped it close to 100 times), there was a little learning curve, but mostly it was intuitive right from the beginning. I get all the same phone apps (this is an improvement in the beginning a few were not available on kindle platform) there could be improvements I think about them from time to time but at this moment can't think of one.  BEST purchase I have ever made!<br />Oh wait there is one problem - yes the battery  it takes a while​ to charge and when using interactive apps the battery life is short - about 4 hours - would like to see 6 - 8"
I like the Fire and use it regularly. I only wished the battery life was longer between charges.
I love it.
I have enjoy kindle very much. Had a kindle fire HDX 7 love it. Just couldn't afford another 16gbt. This one is 8gbt and is a little slower  but pretty much does the same thing just little slower.
"Great!!! It is amazing it has lasted me almost 3 years and I have one scratch but It does nothing to the device!!! The batter is a little confusing, but as long as your not consistently charging it the batteries life will be decent!! Other wise it is amazing😀😀"
"It did not work with my TV, so I returned it."
I have 4 kindles on my account and have never had a problem with the first 3 but this last one I bought was awful. I bought the kindle fire hd 7 for my daughter for Christmas ALL IT DOES IS OVERHEAT AND SHUT ITSELF OFF CONSTANTLY!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS KINDLE AT ALL.I ALSO WILL NOT BE BUYING ANYMORE KINDLES EVER. I called the help line and they said all they could do for me is sell me a new one. I have only had this one for a year and 3 months. Defiantly not worth the money that i spent for this product.
"This is my second Kindle Fire, my previous one purchased 2 and 1/2 years ago. The upgrades on the Kindle are impressive.  I was also pleasantly surprised that Amazon linked my new Kindle to all of the books and apps I had previously purchased. I am more than happy with my new purchase."
"After using an Apple iPad for so many years, I have to say that my Kindle purchase was initially for my 2 year old so we could download some Bubble Guppies to keep her occupied at restaurant outings. It worked like a charm for than purpose but now I reach for it instead of my Kindle Paperwhite to read on because of how easy it is to highlight and access the dictionary. After having it for a few months now, we tend to carry it everywhere and most of my shopping I do on Amazon.com, which is almost daily, I do from this Kindle. I also like the fact that it is so durable. I haven't dropped it yet but have friends that tell me their's has survived some major falls. This ease of use, picture quality, playback speed and just overall functionality is perfect. I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
Works well easier for travel
"The battery runs down too quickly.  When doing the puzzles, the pieces get stuck in one spot.  When I shut it down, it will got to stand-by mode instead even though I push the shut down spot."
"Great, easy to use."
"So far I'm impressed, good picture quality fast video streaming.  Good connection to Amazon Prime Instant Video and amazon music."
"After about 2 weeks of use the Fire HD 7 expired as in dead and couldn't be revived.  I was  not impressed!    HOWEVER, I have modified the rating to reflect the call that I received from Amazon extending any assistance they can provide when the replacement Fire HD arrives and that is impressive!  Since the Fire HD was used only a few times, I will change the rating after the new device arrives."
love love love it. picture is great. use it all the time. love having Prime so I can download free movies to watch anywhere without wifi
V.g
In love it as I am a apple iPad owner this is great for the price n the quality.
I love this tablet
I love it.  It is easy to use and I love the graphics.
"Ive only had it a short time, and it no longer works.  The screen no longer functions as a touch screen.  It's now basically useless."
great little tablet
Great tablet! Bought for my 5 yr old to dwnload movies & games- she loves it!<br />We put on parental controls & just put it on airplane mode & she's all set.
"Kindle Fire is a great option for my 5 yr old. This is her second Fire; gave her the first one when she was 3. I thought a child's Kindle was right for her, but it wasnot advanced enough for her after having a Fire for 2 years."
"Outstanding value. I got mine on sale for $79, exactly $100 less than I was happy to pay for my wife's HDX. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It has the same operating system as the HDX (and therefore the same functionality). It is very fast and although the graphics aren't as nice as the HDX, it doesn't mean anything most of the time. Perhaps some games might take advantage of the difference, but movies don't seem to.  I also must mention that it has a front AND back camera, unlike the HDX, if that is important to you.<br /><br />On the other hand the sound on the HD is excellent, maybe better than the HDX. They really got this right. It is loud and full.<br /><br />I wasn't planning to spend money on a tablet when it went on sale so I got it with the advertisements to save $20. While rooting around its menus I see that you have the chance to change your mind for $15. the ads haven't bothered me so I haven't gone for it. Yet.<br /><br />The HDX is solidly built and has already survived a few spills. My original Fire is still going strong after four years or so (although still underpowered), so I have every confidence that the Fire HD will last until it is obsolete and gets replaced.<br /><br />All in All, I feel that this tablet is well worth its regular price and a steal when it goes on sale. The only improvement I would really like to see is more storage."
"I thought I could by-pass the Apple mini iPad with the features I need BUT the BlueTooth system was not compatible with my older MacBook or with my iPhone 4S. I do not have WIFI and must connect to the internet with BlueTooth. Alas, the Fire HD had to be returned."
"The device is nice, I like that it is lightweight but I wasn't told it was available in other colors. I do have it in a cover so no big deal.<br />The first day after setting it up the night before I had some problems with it needing to re-boot and I had to re-set default settings but luckily not everything had to be restored"
love this
Not good enough for old people.
"Kudos to Amazon.  You never fail to amaze me.  Your customer service and the products  you create are so incredibly amazing!<br /><br />First off,  the shipping on thus was WAY faster than expected which is an obvious wow. Secondly,  upon opening the tablet you can see the great quality put into it.  I love the display and how crisp images are. The speed is fast and what I loved most is that it automatically connected all my kindle books and apps!<br /><br />Definite 5 stars!"
"This isn't my first kindle fire and I'm really enjoying the new features, like Firefly. After my last kindle fire this is SO fast, and being able to control the font size is great! Needless to say I love this new version, now if I could stay away from the Amazon store it would be a miracle!!!"
"Picture quality, excellent.  All the bells & whistles included."
Really love my kindle fire.
This is just what I needed the price was great
Really happy with my Kindle fire!
Excellent easy to use littler weight
Great for streaming video. Great picture and easy to work. I haven't even untapped most of its potential yet. Look forward to doing more with it.
"loving it, just have to get use to handling it."
I've bought 2  but not because I wanted too but to give it another chance.....they only have a lifespan of 2 to 3 months they constantly drop service the screens are paper thin ...definitely not worth 99 bucks more like 40....you spend more time trying to connect to wifi then using it no matter how good your service is....only thing it's good for is books.....this is not a good system but I know I won't get a refund ...May have well let everyone know about my various experience...a Ya Netflix wwe app and youtube only work the first week ....I could be wrong and out of all people got 2 in a row that work like trash...oh and I bought my grandma one and it also works like crap
This is a greaaat tablet.
Love my Fire HD!
Love it!
"I love my new Kindle Fire HD 7! I read, play games and even shop on it. One of the reasons I love it is because it is so fast. The other reason is the front and back camera. The picture quality is 2nd to none. So glad I purchased it!"
I love it and what a great value.  Brilliant colors; good battery life; good camera capability.
"I love my Fire HD 7!  Great picture, easy to use.  Love it!"
"it was a gift. i really like it, its not heavy like the ipad. it plays great movies with a really clear picture. if you are looking for something light and fast this is it!!"
"Haven't had a chance to use but arrived safe, set up went fine. Love the pink!!"
"The battery life is not very long and when reading a book, it sometimes will auto-rotate and revert to the beginning of the book.  Not impressed.  This is my 2nd Kindle; I only purchased this one because my first one was difficult to charge, and I thought it would be cheaper to just buy a new one."
"Love it, it is my second generation edition, and my first one is still going strong! Now I have one for the Grandkids to use!"
I like the Fire HD. It's fast and easy to navigate through. However it appears that most of the apps offered on the App store are not compatible with the Fire HD. Maybe they shouldn't offer an app store or app's if they are not going to work or have limited access. There are some apps that aren't even offered in the App store. It is disappointing that we are unable to link our cell phone to the Fire HD. I'm not sure if Kindle has acknowledged the bad reviews on the popular apps offered on the App store. If I would have known that there would be limited applications and errors then I might have just gone with a regular tablet.
Love the Fire HD 7.  It is now my 3rd Kindle product.  I'm still playing with it and learning all the tricks to using it.  The picture and sound is fantastic.
"I bought this as a gift for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it. This is my 4th Kindle purchase and each one seems to get better. The display is great. I am eyeing the Fire HDX 8.9 for myself! I just wonder if a new Kindle is in the works. I just wish Amazon would consider have more sales to entice customers. One of the reasons I bought the Fire HD 7, 7 &#34; display was that it was on sale for $99.00 which I thought was a good price."
Great Tablet !!  Bought it for my wife and she loves it ..  Fast Shipping !!
"Really enjoy this Fire HD.  I'm able to easily read books and play the games I download. The battery life is good. The way I use it, it isn't necessary for me to recharge the battery during the day. However if I need to, I can recharge it via computer.  The only thing that I would change is to add a small light so that it is known that the Kindle is charging, as unless the Kindle is turned on, you can't tell if it is charging or not."
Received this as a birthday gift and I love it!
I love my kindle fire! I wish the camera was of better quality though.
I love my fire HD and use it every dsy
"Bought it to take to work and stream music.  It is lightweight, good sound.  Takes ice pics.  Just what I wanted!"
Too thin need to charged often I don't know mine is build very bad the body
Does everything that i wanted.
"I loved my first generation Kindle Fire so much that I hated to give it up at all. But the charger port quit and I had to go to something else. This Fire HD 7 went on sale so I figured it'd be good since I loved the old one so much. And it's true - it's awesome and at half the price or less than other tablets! The new volume button is great, the hd screen is great, the improvements in the Kindle books reading experience is incredible! And Amazon is awesome, too. Customer service there rocks!"
"Fast, simple to use, and parental controls make me feel good about letting my kids play on the 2 I ordered!"
Wife loves it.
Bought this for my daughters 7th bday. She loves it! It's actually a lot nicer than I expected. Great buy
So easy for my 88 year old mother to use!
I love it...don't think I can go back to reading paper books.
"I am unable to give a full review that is based on adequate experience with my fire hd7 as u have been using it for less than a week now. However, setup was a breeze as all I had to do was to follow the steps and got it up and running with very easy to follow steps. Battery life is pretty decent once the setting are set to save battery life as much as possible. I hate the fact that the device is locked to Amazon's app store. Having access to Google play store would have been much better. To offset that though a friend of mine showed me how to side load apps. I regret not purchasing the 18g though as reviews regarding the limited space the 8g has is very scary so I try not to download too many apps even with the ability to save stuff in the cloud. Sound and video quality are excellent for the price. I am not able to download music yet as I am prompted to put in my credit card info of which I have not gotten the chance to or not sure I really want to so I might just load on music from my laptop to have on the go. Because I used my free trial of amazon prime before I got this device I cannot benefit from amazon prime on my fire hd7 unless I subscribe using the annual fee of which I will not make such a commitment.<br /><br />My real purpose for purchasing this device is for school so I don't have to carry around my laptop but I have not gotten full use of the tablet for that just yet but I am looking forward to learning more about it and to have a very good experience with it.<br /><br />I may provide additional updates as I get the hang of this, but so far so good. A decent enough device and seemingly worth the buy.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful."
Really enjoying my Kindle Fire HD.  The battery seems to last forever.
Great
I'm still getting accustomed to navigating around on it but it is pretty much what I would consider a plug and play device. An extremely user friendly multi media device even though my main usage of it is for books and study. Great product compatible with online usages.
Bought this for my mom and she loves it! Never puts it down.
Excelente
"I have the 9&#34; kindle, my husband was always using mine. I bought him one and he is very pleased.  We are a Kindle family and love them."
Great device. Easy to use. Thanks
Works great! Better then expected. Highly recommended. Best Kindle Fire yet.
Love my Fire.  Does everything I need.
"very well built, and for my purpose it does all i need it to do."
It should come with more Than 1 free audiobook. Then 1 /<br />Month for 14.95 is no deal ... Other than that I'm not disappointed.
Really like the Fire HD 7&#34; - just the right size to fit in your purse - clarity and quality of picture are great. Would recommend this product
It was a gift and the recipient loved it.
"This Item is a little hard to figure out how to use, I wish it would have came with an instruction manual, also this item was smaller than what I thought it would be and a little bit thicker than my other kindle. I have to say I think I like my other kindle better although I'm really not sure since I just got this one."
"Great size, beautiful clear screen. So happy with this purchase."
"Love it. I had a kindle first generation and just finally updating. This kindle is more sleek, faster and comes in a nice color.  Also has a lot more features.  I was not disappointed."
"It's a cool tablet, but lacks some power in order to run some of the more demanding new game apps out there. I enjoy it for being my first tablet since I won it at an auction for work, but still use my smart phone more."
great so far
"does not work well outside.  if u do any outdoor reading, this one is not for u"
I never purchased this item did I get charged for this?!
My first tablet & I think it's amazing!  It was delivered just 2 days after I ordered it.  The only problem I've had is that sometimes I wish the battery life was longer.
Great tablet!
Still getting used to it but I find that when I need to research something on Amazon it's instantly available. Much more efficient than typing the address into the phone and logging in to my account.
Bought it for our toddler and it's perfect!
"Love it for the most part. It keeps telling me that my wifi is connected but my Kindle is not connected to the wifi. I have to unplug my wifi and replug it in to reset it. If others in the house are using it, I either have to make them all mad or wait until everyone is asleep."
I love it. This is my 2nd Kindle. It just keeps getting better and better.
"Is fine except for the special offers screen that auto presents every time you log on.  I hate that.  Very disappointed I can't stop it.  If I want to look for an item, I know how.  That offers screen is very irritating.  I won't buy anything forced in my face.  Please remove.  This kindle is a replacement for one with a charging port issue, so I am already not a totally satisfied customer to have to buy a new one. Again, please remove the special offers screen.  My thanks for your help. Rating would be higher if not for this issue."
Five stars
The Fire is fine but no instructions came with it and not ALL of us know how to manoeuve around those gadgets!
Fast shipping.  Helpful staff.  Always come back to Amazon.com.
I love it and so does my daughter. I wish they had a bigger one.
It was everything I hoped it was.
"It has very little space for data. While it looks great, there's not much you can store on it. 8GB are not enough for the things that I do with my other kindle. Honestly, I thought it would be like my Fire phone, with the dimensional effects and all. But it isn't. Very disappointed by that. I was hoping to use it for the games that I play on my phone (you know, bigger screen and whatnot), but it doesn't do that, its just like the others, just less memory space. I haven't even really used it since I received it and set it up. Once I put my music on it, and had to delete half, I still had no room for apps and books, let alone documents. Even the Fire phone does more, just smaller screen."
Enjoy my new Fire and all the features I didn't have with the 'good old Kindle'.  Bought it on the $99 sale and was well worth the price.  I was getting frustrated with not seeing my book covers in color.
"I'm still learning about all the things it can do, but I'm a little disappointed in the battery life.  At first, it held a charge for 6 - 8 hours.  Now it only holds for about 3 hours, and takes forever to recharge."
Easy shift from older kindle.
I bought this for my son and he loves it. It's very sturdy. I will recommend.
I love ❤ my Kindle Fire 🔥
"Wonderful, love the color. Has a bright beautiful display and I've had no issues thus far."
I purchased this for my 84 year old motherinlaw.  She travels and always carried a suitcase of books.  I told her that I had already put over 500 books from my account on the Kindle.  She looked at it and said &#34;HOW&#34;. She is just so happy.  Glad now she doesn't have to lug around an extra suitcase.  I highly recommend it.
More than I expected...awesome
"Since it came with no instructions, I am learning as I go.  Can't seem to find how to make the print larger in reading the books.  Would like to know how to delete books that I have read & no longer care to keep on device or in the cloud."
Love it
Perfect fit to the HD7.  Don't wasted your money on the generic covers.
I really love it. Does what I want for the price and has good display
Love it!!!  This is my second one.....
A perfect gift for Father's Day. Just the Right size and weight... with nice volume to allow me to listen in my car. Only thing missing was a recording app to allow me to practice my  baritone parts.
I am very happy with my new Fire HD 7.
"I love my new Kindle HD.  As for the ads - I love 'em.  They are entertaining and they are just the splash screen when you start up.  I received it as a birthday present and an upgrade to my Kindle Fire.  For only $100 it is well worth it and a very nice upgrade.  No negative comments so far as long as you know that you're buying into the Amazon experience, which, for me, is great."
I bought the Kindles for my kids and they love them.
Love it!  The display is sharp and crisp. Functions fast and does everything I could hope for. Apps are great and most are superior to what I find on google play. Also love the free app of the day. Gives me a chance to try different apps that iwouldntnormally try. Thank you Kindle!
I cannot get Plants vs. Zombies 2.
"Bought both of my grandsons the Kindle Fire first generation. One of the boys was 7 and the other one 5.  Both their devices are still going strong. They play games on them, watch movies and because I give them Amazon gift card for good grades, etc. they also purchase books and read as well.  They love their Kindles and I have to say, the tablets have been extraordinarily durable. I have an old black and white Kindle that is probably 6 years old that has been everywhere with me packed into a carryon.  It is still in great shape.  I love it but today I am shopping for a Fire tablet because I want the backlit screen for reading at night and the option to stream a movie or check email on a screen larger than my phone. Kindles are a great option to a more expensive tablet for apps that don't require a huge processor.  I would have given them 5 stars, but one of the boy's came without  a charger in the box which was an inconvenience until we could get one for him. I don't know if it was a packing error or for some reason didn't come with a charger, but we got an inexpensive one and it worked out. Still, I would give 4.5 stars."
My second one and I love it!
"I only paid $99. But now that I have it, I would have paid full price if I would have had to."
Very easy to set up and use.
Works Great! My new go to tool!
it was not good my first kindle was excellent. this replacement was not good from day one. its memory was full for some reason.
"I didn't realize that the Fire uses a proprietary operating system which I find a bit confusing. I am sure that once I get used to it, it will be fine."
I AM ENJOYING READING MY BOOKS AND I AM SURE I WILL ENJOL OTHER THINGS WHEN I LEARN HOW TO FIND THEM AND GET THEM OPERATIONAL!
Really nice and easy to use
Images are very clear and stunning. Dislike that you can't tell when charging is complete (no light indicator like on the older models.)
Love it.  Gave my generation 2 to my Grandson and bought this new one for myself.  Much faster response times than my old one.  I use it all the time.
Have had issues with some apps freezing. Great  sound for my music.  Good quality camera
So far works great Iwould still like to find out how to set so I can send text messages
"It's an ok tablet except for the fact that Amazon prevents you from using many popular and important applications.  The most frustrating part for me is the inability to let kids to use kid safe internet browsers such as Mobicip and K9 Web Protection. There are some workarounds that are described on the internet, and I've tried them.  However, in the end good luck trying to get one of them working from within Kindle FreeTime. In fact it seems like Amazon purposely doesn't want any other browser than theirs to work on Kindle.<br /><br />Other apps off the top of my head that are not allowed on Kindle: Chrome, GMail, YouTube, Google Play Store, Farmville,Instagram, FireFox.  There are many more.  You are limited to the Amazon app store, and can't get the full library of Android apps from Google Play.  I see that they purposely block Google apps for business ($) reasons.  I bought two of these and regret it.  My kids are constantly disappointed when I they ask for a game (or internet browsing) that their friends can do on other tablets, but they cannot."
Excellent in every way.
In love with it! So is my daughter!! I love the amazon free time. Just what I needed for a great price.
"Overall I like it. It's my first experience with a tablet. I'm disappointed, however, with the short battery life. It's more like 5 hours , not 8. I won't be able to take it on a long trip since it requires such frequent recharges."
Good read
had much more expectations. good for playing games only. Very disappointed that there is no instagram and you can only see post cannot upload pics or anything. :))
"I finally had to get a new Kindle Fire. The set up is a little different but after getting used to it, I really love it."
I like everything about my kindle fire but the ads. If i knew before hand that I can't get rid of them it might not be so annoying.
"My eight year old saved money for months to purchase this kindle. Sadly, he dropped it within the first week  and the screen cracked. We called Amazon to see if we could pay to have it repaired and they said that they do not do repairs. I asked about the replacement screens and repair kits that I saw for sale on Amazon and the rep said that that is not a product they make or endorse. She said there is no way to replace a broken screen. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of concern and helpfulness that was shown in this situation. At the VERY LEAST she could have offered to let us buy a new one at the same price we purchased the broken one. (The price has gone up $40). It is completely unacceptable to me that we there is no way to repair the screen on an otherwise functioning device. We are just supposed to put it in a landfill and drop another $140 on a new one?<br /><br />PS: if anyone has any suggestions or experience replacing a screen, please let me know! Thanks in advance!"
Got and love it.
"This Fire proved to be of better quality that other tablets that I had run across. I know some customers complained about little things but either I am very lucky or Amazon is getting better control over the manufacturing process. The last 6 various Amazon products that I have purchased and gifted have performed flawlessly. I expect that this one will also. I didn't go for the extra warranty cause let's face it. The technology is always pushing ahead. Yesterday is current and tomorrow is obsolete. For this reason, I didn't purchase the higher end performing Fires either. If you go for the best deal 95% of the time you are going to be happy with your purchase."
"Kindle Fire performs well for movies, TV, and reading ebooks.  However, I bought the Kindle Fire primarily to browse the internet, at which it completely and utterly fails.  Reading a 60-line column results in (multiple) errors saying &#34;Tab not responding&#34;.  Basically, the Silk browser is unusable."
A great product. And it runs smoothly with Amazon apps and products
Customer service broke machine so I have just a black screen. Poor service. I liked device but worst customer service ever. Not only can they not help but they made my kindle totally unable to open and access all my apps games and books I was able to use when I called.  Total black screen after their so called help.  I had a working device except trouble accessing store. Called service department. They told me up press sync and they would update my system. She told me then to turn it off and then turn it on. After that it would not turn on. Just have a black screen. She assured me technical support would get it running at their find by resetting it and they would call back within 24 hours and have it fixed. No call. Got an email it was resolved. I still have a black screen. Then I sent negative feedback to the email feedback request and they called me back. Said I could buy an upgraded model. I told them this is not acceptable since I had a working machine until they did something at their end that broke it so I have the black screen. I asked to speak to a manager. They said one would call in 30-60 minutes.  I'm sure I will be calling them again as it's been over 60 minutes now and still no call. They didn't call back before when they said they would within 24 hours either. Rep kept saying in sorry and they would fix it yesterday. Wrong. Today it's I am sorry but you can buy an upgraded model. Some kind of scam to me. Break my machine on their end and offer me ability to buy an upgraded new one. And speak like this is a generous offer on their end. I don't think so. Too bad because I really liked it. This was the second one I have purchased for our family. It lasted barely over a year with not a lot of use. Wish I could do zero star but you have to put at least one or you cannot submit. Zero for customer service. I liked the device however. But with this kind of no service it makes it expensive and better options out there then. Too bad.
"con:  ads, Freezes every once in a while .<br /><br />but not that bad.I like it"
"The Fire HD 7&#34; is just amazing! Everything works great. One thing I could not understand is that even though it's written that the memory is 8 GB, when I opened the storage it showed me less than 6 GB free space. All the rest is awesome. The delivery was really really fast - in two days. Thank YOU!"
First tablet I've had but so far it has been everything that I've needed it for. Love the Kindle apps along with the other applications that go with it. Easy to use also.
Love it!!
"I would probably give it a 5 start however, I haven't had it long enough to understand everything about the Kindle Fire."
I love my Fire tablet! It is so user friendly! It is the best deal on the price also!
Loving this product so far!
Have only used this kindle for a short time. This will make the 4th kindle in the family.Got it while on sale I wanted more GB. My grandson got my old one and he is one happy boy. I have no use for the camera and the battery seems to drain faster than my old one.
My son likes the speed and size of both the screen and storage. He says it does start to glitch and sends him back to the home screen sometimes.
Met all my expectations a little disappointed with the apps and the way they sync with my other devices
"I brought two of these and only to find out that it  doesn't have some apps, especially, the main one that most people use which is Instagram... I find that to be crazy in this day and age how your not able to access  the most recent apps out there. Unfortunately I won't be purchasing any more kindles. Il have to resort to apple or samsung tablet. Otherwise battery life and game usage is good. So I have I give it 3.5- 4 stars for that"
Nice tablet for only $99.
Does what I expected and more the book selection is great reading from this sure beats trying to read on small cell phone. Colors are fantastic
Great product!
Love it
"Having trouble moving around in it and the help section wasn't much help for my problems. Don't know who to call to get information. My old kindle was much easier to figure out. When a book is put into a collection it stays on the books page. There are so many books there I don't know which I have read and which ones I haven't. Some are checked, some aren't so I have to go into each one to see if I have read it. Very time consuming and annoying"
Enjoying very much
Disappointing battery life.  No manual.
"So far, it does what it needs to do; however, the battery life is not nearly as long as it says it is.  10 hours, not even close.  a disappointment, that is.  Some of the internet pages that I used the reading view cut off the last paragraphfrom what I can tell.  I'm not sure if the cut off other parts or not, because I did not go back and read what I had already read. I simply stopped using the reading view mode.  I wish the actual width of the kindle was smaller.  It's not that comfortable to hold one-handed; so, I'm glad that I did not get the newer version, which is wider still without an actual increase in screen size.  I find it odd the the charging inlet is right by the power button on the &#34;top, right-hand&#34; of the device.  I wish the power button was on the left-hand side with the charging inlet at the bottom.  I just end up having the device oriented where everything is at the bottom instead, which is a bit weird but better than the alternative.  So, besides the odd placement and width, I'm really only disappointed with the battery life.  I'm only getting six hours at best with a dimmed screen, and I have only had it for 15 days... and no, I have not over-charged it yet.  I might have other problems with it or praises, but I simply haven't used it that long to have more opinions on it.  Also, it takes a long time to charge the battery."
"This works just as I expected.  It is fast and, easy to view."
"Love it, seems lighter and brighter in color."
"Love my new FireHD.  But here it is exactly one year later. It quit. Won't turn on.  It's fully charged, or least should be, it's been plugged into the Kindle charger for over 12 hours, but I'm really not sure.  IT WON'T TURN ON!"
"it took a little while to get used to all the features. I made many phone calls for technical help, but all the health was not necessarily helpful. That is the only complaint I can make about the units. The gadget itself is very fine."
Very much enjoy the new kindle. I have the 2012 version too. For a tablet it does all I need it to do and does it very well. I use it for site walks at work and the external camera and evermore make them very easy to record. Movies look great too
Works as expected. Camera isn't that good.
just what I expected!!
Still getting used to it!
It's the best ever. I love it!!!!!!
Love it!
Best birthday gift ever. I really enjoy it.
It's everything I wanted and more.
I bought a couple of these at christmas and they have been very good and sturdy even after being dropped several times
"Looks cheap, feels cheap, not worth what it's priced for. Amazon should do better than that. My friend has a Chinese tablet that's not even branded and it works, feels, and looks better."
My new Kindle sure surpasses my first one. Everything is instantaneous.
"I bought this for my husband for Xmas. He loves it and wishes he'd had one long ago!  It is great for traveling and at home, too. Large enough screen for books and videos."
This is my first tablet. I really like it. Still learning new things every day.
"This was a good purchase. It works great, and is just as described. It arrived in excellent condition, and delivery was good and fast."
Love this HD Fire. Took about a second to set up my Wi-Fi . Fast connections. Wish I could get TD Bank for Mobile Depositing though.
I love it.
Great HD quality...
Works well no issues.
"The kindle fire is a decent little device. Unless you have children. Trying to stop your kids from being able to purchase stuff through the device but still allowing them to download photos to their KID Profiles is impossible. Your kids want to play Minecraft Pocket Edition? Get an iPad. Apple has created a simple process for managing kid accounts and privacy settings and restrictions and more...<br /><br />I'm an iOS developer AND an Android developer... I THOUGHT that I could set settings on the kindle device I got for my step-daughter so that she could play her games AND I could restrict purchases to her bringing the device to me...<br /><br />Sure, but if you want to allow her download skins for her minecraft characters there is absolutely NO SETTING TO ALLOW THIS. I have to open up ALL controls and let her do EVERYTHING as an adult profile in order to give her this ability.<br /><br />My stepson who is on an IPAD can do all of this and more but I still have restricted him from purchasing COMPLETELY... he can download all the skins he wants... ZERO PROBLEMS. I've spent several HOURS now trying to configure the kindle with similar settings.<br /><br />IMPOSSIBLE.<br /><br />Friggin ridiculous... Completely unacceptable. WHY should I have to develop an entire application to do what should be done OUT OF THE FRIGGIN BOX!!!! Are you kidding me?! This is completely Amazon's fault and is the reason this is the LAST Amazon device I will ever buy. I owned the original Kindle, andI loved it. I owned a few other later versions... I loved them... but add a child into the mix and Amazon is clueless on giving parents the granularity of control needed to customize the security needed.<br /><br />Apple has it figured out... Amazon needs to learn how to mimic this...<br /><br />RIDICULOUS."
"I really enjoy the hd fire 7, only real issue is the lack of some apps, for me not having YouTube, vudu, clash of clans and Marvel was a letdown."
"Had the ASUS before this, and frankly, this is heads and shoulders above it. At a quarter the price!"
Great
Easy-to-use
"Love how it works and it's great for SOME things.  My biggest complaint is the limited availability of apps.  So many apps that I want to use are not in the app store, like apps that are available EVERYWHERE else are not available for the Kindle. It's actually ridiculous.."
"It is a functional unit and I accept that some of my frustrations may solely lay with a need to learn the tablet further.  However, forcing the 'owner' to be stuck on advertisements with the sleep screen/ initial screen is entirely unacceptable to me.  Unless this is a removed feature, this will be the only Amazon tablet, at least Fire, that I ever buy.  If I had realized to look for that sooner, I would not have bought it.  Otherwise it seems functional enough."
works pretty well. too bad there is no external sd card capability
Bought this for my boyfriend's aunt and she *loves* it!!!  She's just under 70 years old and reads a lot so that was my original thought on her using this.  It turns out that with the large fonts it's not only super easy to use but she adores the camera as well to both take pics of family and to easily view.  It's been much easier than a traditional digital camera for her.
We go it for my son for his birthday and it's everything we hoped for and more.  The only that was a little frustrating was trying to find where the settings were.  The instructions were not very clear.
"10 stars!! I absolutely LoveThis kindle! I couldn't have designed a more personal Tablet for myself! It does everything I need it too, and more :). There's not a thing I would Chage! Great pic quality too!! Thank you for this! :)"
"Kid-friendly, well organized, and a perfect addition to our family's tablet collection. It's battery life is stellar! I love how there is a way to set up accounts for each child, set time limits, and more. The Fire was a value!"
best thing ever!
Great but not excellent
Ipan died from no apparent reason. So switched due to price and size. Still adapting to the unit.
So far it is great I got this for my daughter who is special needs and she has no problem using it
I have loved all my kindle and my newest is fantastic!
Excellent tablet - met all my wants and needs. Only wish it was available in 32 GB
"Great tablet for the price. Does not have the processing power of an iPad, but is a functional tablet for someone that wants a great reader with other primary tablet functions such as browsing the Internet and downloading apps. Overall, I am very pleased."
"I like that it has a front and rear camera, it is great but i was disappointed that I am not able to read epub"
Great tablet for a child
Wonderful product
Way more than I expected.  More updated and user friendly then my older Fire 8&#34;.  The size is just as good as my 8&#34; as far as being able to navigate without having trouble.
Love the kindle fire. Giving it as a gift
"It is good, but don't expect too much from a cheap device. Problems from performance likely due to low RAM. For instance, videos on facebook always skip to the last 3 seconds or so and have to be reloaded to watch from the beginning. Certain websites become unoperable like posting to my blog using cut and paste. The memory gets overwhelmed. That being said, I wish the screen were larger. I can't imagine having a 6&#34; and the memory upgrade should not be looked at as optional. I filled the remainder of the 8 GB with programs and a few books about a week after I bought it. Bluetooth keyboard is everything. I bought some 3rd party version integrated into a case."
The fire is great. I like all of the options available.
"This is my fourth Kindle.  I love the size.  My only regret was that 2 days after I bought it, it went on sale for a lot less."
"So far so good,have not had it very long."
"This is the 6th Kindle I have purchased from Amazon. I have gotten them for several of my family members plus for myself. They are well worth the money. They connect to the internet really well and have lots of apps you can get for free or for a small price. I read books, play games, search the web, take pictures, watch movies and TV shows and check out Facebook . I would recommend any of the Kindle Fires. The only thing I would like to see is being able to have Adobe flash player on them. Sometimes I can't play videos that are posted on Facebook but that is the only drawback."
Great for reading and any apps you want to enjoy!
Perfect for my 3 year old. But make sure you purchase amazon prime to get the full experience
Everything I expected. A great upgrade from my 1st generation kindle. everything transferred to the new one just fine.
"Both of my daughters have one ,and I used their's so much that they got me one for my birthday. I love it and so do they."
Best fire yet
I wouldn't mind having another one.  Love it!
Love it so far👍🏾
Great tablet for the price.
Cute and compact. Great to carry with you. The main problem is the battery life. It uses it much to quickly.
This is a great product
I love the volume control on the side which you don't have to turn the Kindle on to you.
I am happy so far with this purchase it makes reading so much easier on the go. The web browser isn't great but I mainly got it to read and watch movies and that it does great and the sound is nice.
great for traveling with
Yep Rugged
Great piece of equipment for such an affordable price.
It's  great!
Great tablet but ... HOW DOES THE CAMERA WORK? I cannot find the instructions anywhere!
I use it for everything . It does what I need and more.
"I like the reading area very much.  What I don't like is not being able to read outside.  Even with the screen protector-purchased separately-there is so much glare it cannot be read in the sun.  I have tried multiple settings with the font size, color, background.  Nope.  None work. I wanted this for a reading device only.  I have to say, I really do not like the ads on the screen when I open it, hate that the shopping basket is the first thing on the carousel.  It comes up each time even though I remove from the carousel.  A variety of things are automatically added to the carousel randomly like the camera or whatever.  I had a kindle paperwhite.  I could read that one outside.  It  had great battery life.  This one does not.  Cannot make it through a day of reading without a charge.  Have not traveled with it yet, but not sure it will make it .  Cannot address other functions as I have never used any of them.  Overall, this was a bit disappointing."
Can't ask for a better or more affordable tablet!!
Excellent value and usefulness for the price. I do wish it were glare free in bright sunlight but I can manage well enough to satisfy. Plenty of bells and whistles and functionality is abundant and fairly easy to pick up. On-line user manual is a joke and thank goodness for the forum. They'll definitely give you the answer you're looking for.
"I've fought having a tablet for so long, but finally decided to go for it with the Amazon Fire. What took me so long?! It's great to join my Kindle, Amazon Music and web browsing (or playing) on one device. The screen is so clear and the device is so easy to use. Great price and as always, top-notch customer service from Amazon."
fantastic!!!!!!!  way beyond expectations.  Just a wonderful product
Best purchase I was ever talked into getting
GREAT!!
"I really enjoy my fire hd 7, let's me do everything I need it to. I'm still getting used to customizing its functions but it works really well for me !"
"It does not have apps store, or if it has then it is hard to operate I have not been able to use it since it was bought just lying useless at home."
"Works great, good quality, just as described."
The speed of the device and ease of use make the Kindle Fire HD7 one of the best purchases I have made in a while. The price for this tablet is amazingly affordable considering the high quality. I would recommend it to anyone.
Very happy with my kindle!
this is great I can read a German novel and if I run into a word I do not know all I need to do is highlight it to get the definition.
It's okay.
It's everything I need in a tablet.
"Great tablet, but I recommend investing a bit more on an HDX with more memory. It will be worth it in the longterm."
Love it. It is a mini computer. It can do so much and is easy and lightweight. Would recommend this one.
"So far so good, replaced a 1st gen kindle that stopped taking a charge every time"
"The apps crash constantly, even though I keep my carousel clear and restart the device on a regular basis. There are certain apps I can't download like Instagram. On the positive side, the display is beautiful. I love reading books on it. Games run pretty well, but they also crash, it's so annoying."
Love it!!!
"Bough this for my girlfriend because she is always saying she wished she had something bigger than the phone but not as big as my XOOM... works for her perfectly... its fast I have tried it out and the screen is really bright and clear... I have alsys loved amazon products but this is my first kind like this... I would buy again and I am looking at a bigger screen for myself... I would buy this again without any question... if this is the size you are looking for, then this is a good product"
Easy-to-use.  However. I would have preferred a hard copy of Manuel so I could read set up info as I setup the kindle fire.
"Let me start by saying that this is my fourth Kindle. I bought this Kindle for myself for Christmas and gave my daughter my old Kindle Fire.  I wish I had the old one back. I am a Kindle fan.  I love Kindle.  I love Amazon. But this Kindle is a dud. No a DUD. The screen is not sensitive. Often I'll touch a book three or four times before it opens.  And 8GB is not enough. I have ONE Game my Kindle, Minecraft for my son. Still I have to archive my books and all but ONE audiobook at a time or the wireless shuts down because my storage is full. It's almost not worth it to have audiobooks with this Kindle.  I can't download if I don't have WIFI and then it takes fifteen minutes to download an audiobook. I haven't bought one since I've owned this Kindle. I mean Seriously?! This is 2015. I shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes for anything digital. My old Kindle would allow me to search the internet at will.  This one is so unresponsive that I just put it aside and reach for my laptop.  I never used to do that. This Kindle is so bad that I often use my work provided i pad with a Kindle app instead of the Kindle itself. That's a shame. I love you, Amazon, but you've really let me down on this one."
"Love it!  Easy to use...clear bright screen!  Love to read, love my fire!!!  :)"
"I am happy with my new Kindle Fire except for one issue, I am not able to access my favorite games on pogo.com."
Now that I can charge it I am very happy with my tablet. it seems the block on the charging cord is defective.I am using a borrower block.
"It is perfect.  I do it all while sitting in my favorite chair.  Movies, music, games, internet, books  It even runs my printer without having to stir.  Not to mention all the fabulous apps from the Amazon app store.  Wish I could tell you how to improve it, but am at a lost for words on that matter.  Both laptop and PC are getting mighty lonely.  Without a doubt one the best things I ever did for myself."
Excelent tablet very nice design and performance for that price
Love it!
love it-----my 2nd one -----love them both----no problems----easier to handle-my wife has a 10&#34;---no-no-no to big -to heavy I will take the kindle any day---I can do anything she can do---and faster<br />ty<br />john
"I own 3 other tablets that I got frustrated with. The interfaces (OS) were difficult to use and I got frustrated waiting for web sites to load. I could not find any good user manuals for any of them. My wife gave me this one for Father's Day. I have only had it for a couple of weeks but am already using it for many things like receiving and sending e-mail, checking weather, reading books and more. There are many how to manuals on Amazon to pick from. It is a great value for the money!<br />The reason for only 4 stars is that I have not figured out a way to print directly to my non-wireless HP Laser printer. I have tried PrintHand Mobile Print and HP Print Plugin but so far no luck. I'm thinking it can't be done. The ability to print, although a nice addition if it could, really isn't necessary for me.<br />One last thing, I purchased a Kindle Fire HD 7 leather case cover with Wakeup/Sleep from FutureVision11 on Ebay. Same style I got for my wife's Kindle Paper White. It turns the Kindle on when opened and off when closed. No more waiting for boot-up."
This tablet is just what I needed for a & inch tablet. I find a 10 inch tablet to big for me. I was able to download the apps I wanted. Now I can have my tablet and Kindel all in one. While at the Doctors office I can either surf the net or read on of my many books.
This is my 3rd Kindle and I'm very pleased.
"Can't say enough great things about this device!  My kids absolutely ove this thing and for the price, they each get their own.  Rather than spend $400 on a game system and another $50 - $60 per game, they have access to hundreds of games and apps for free...many of which are educational.<br /><br />This is perfect for the kids and very convenient for trips and other times when the kids have to sit around waiting.  Otherwise they are always asking to play games on my phone.<br /><br />Love it!"
Love it! Having a hard time putting it down!
Nice.
Battery consumption is a bit more that I expected and it is weighs much more that the kindle paperwhite it replaces
"Awesome, Love it"
I love it
"I like my previous version of Kindle Fire much more than this one.  Even though this is a so-called &#34;tablet&#34; I find it hard to navigate.  Also, after I am done reading and close the cover, it shuts itself off completely.  Requiring a restart each and every time.  What a hassle. Last night I couldn't even get it to turn on until after I plugged it into the electric outlet for a few minutes even though the battery indicate 87%.  Since I really only use it to read e-books, I should not have bought this version.  If you want something that you can use to check your email, surf the net, and keep up with your social media, this version may be ok for you.  But, like me, if you only want an e-reader, stick to an earlier version which is much easier to navigate and read.  I think I wasted my money on this one.  I should have been more diligent in reading others' comments before I spent my money.  I'm planning on giving this one away and returning to my previous Kindle version which is much easier on the eyes."
I have enjoyed my new Fire very much.  It was very easy to update it with everything I wanted from my old Kindle.
I love my new toy!!!! That's what I call it. Only thing I'm mad about is I can't read my google plays books on this. But I guess I'll just buy books from what Kindle offers.
"We gave two of these Kindles to grandchildren, ages 10 and l4.  They love them and they are getting lots of use from them.  They love to watch movies when bored and also take photos of their trips.  Tana Calaba"
"Very fast, excellent  grsphics, outstanding performance.  Great little tablet  that meets all my needs."
Great product for my 7 year old.  Downfall is that you can't download apps from Google Play
"Great,taking time with so many new items, I feel sure once I'm familiar with those it w be much easier. So far I'm very pleased."
Has lots of features.  Love the cameras.
"great product, wish I had done this years ago"
Wife loves it she was using my old kindle fire took her awhile to get use to but loves it now
I love the quality of sound and picture. Even better than my last Kindle.
I love it!  Perfect size to read.
It's a great tablet especially if you have prime membership.  I love it.
"Very nice, easy to navigate. Would get five stars if not for the preponderance of ads and the difficulty of accessing apps for Amazon competitors (e.g. Nook)."
This is my third Kindle and I love it.  It does everything I want it to and is easy to carry with me.
Love my new kindle fire!!
"Extremely pleased with the Kindle Fire HD 7.  I expect to use this mostly for reading, but I am very pleased with how well-integrated the web-browsing is. I like the availability of apps on the device, however, the photography apps, which would interest me the most, are severely hampered by the 2-3 mp camera built into the unit.  All in all, I am very happy with this new Kindle and expect to get as much use from it as I did from my old Kindle (5 years old)."
"I'm disappointed that there is almost no use for this product unless you pay for or buy something.  There's a small selection of free reference books and older books that have lapsed copyrights.  If you don't want pay for an Amazon Prime account at $100/year and Books at $10 and up each it's pretty much only useful for email as long as you have a wi-fi connection.  Also, it displays ads whenever it's turned on and the battery life is poor."
It's fine. Slow at times
It is a very excellent picture
I Love the kindle fire.
just what I wanted
This is my second Fire. It does everything I want it to and more. Easy to use and understand. I love it!
"I have an old Kindle and an old iPad, so this Kindle Fire has me thrilled!  It is very easy to adapt to, and I love the size and weight."
Easy to use
"I may forget my phone, but my Kindle is always with me. The screen is amazing!!"
Good!
I am a little out of practice with computers but its been fun geetting started washington post was a suprise
My husband loves it
Did not know I couldn't get google apps or other apps on this kindle. Or  I would have purchased something different. You can only download what &#34; amazon kindle&#34; allows you to. I paid for some apps only to find out they couldn't be used/ opened because of some feud between amazon /kindle and google. Cannot get refunded for paid apps. Very disappointed with this purchase.
"First off I ordered this item without ads and it came with ads. I called customer service and the customer service rep I spoke to was a total b!tch as I tried to explain my frustration that I didn't want to see the ads every time I open the thing up because I had paid NOT to see the ads, she interrupted me and argued with me DURING THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION. When I finally had to get aggressive with her and shut her up so she'd listen, she got even nastier. UNBELIEVABLE. By the end of the conversation I asked her to repeat her name and she wouldn't give it to me. I finally said, Let's start over. I'm Susan. She said her name was Kayla. Well, Kayla, you completely and totally suck at customer service. They never did remove the ads from my item so I spent an extra $20 for absolutely nothing. The quality of the tablet is not the issue, though it's way too small for being really useful to me. It's the size and Amazon customer service I have an issue with. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE."
Impressed w readability especially as my eyes get older
Love it thank you wish it came with a case o well
I love my Kindle.  I can watch all my Amazon Instant Videos on it and I can get Closed Captioning easily!
Great!
An awesome device.
A heavenly product
Love it!
My daughter saved up and bought this with her own money. She loves it.
"Been using Kindle since the very first day! My only complaint is that it doesnt bring earphones but after that perfect!! The screen image is beautiful, great quality, easy to use and perfect to read and do anything on it."
"There's no need for a lengthy, detailed review, since Id simply repeat the same stuff you've already read in other reviews.<br /><br />This tablet is fast, looks great, and feels durable.  The only downside is the app selection compared to Google's Play store.<br /><br />If Kindle would support the Play store, these tablets would be unbeatable in every facet."
Just what I wanted
I got this for my 4 yr. old grand daughter and she loves it. I too like to use it... fast on the web and the pictures are very clear. I actually watch a movie on it when I first opened it and set it up. It never once lagged or messed up in any way.
"We love our kindles.  The color is bright,  it is great for the price compared to other tablets.  Works for what we need it for, games and reading."
I haven't had a problem yet. This my third one.
Amazon apps store is terrible
gift.
"The Kindle Fire HD7 is a well-designed tablet, with user-friendly features that I have yet to fully investigate. My only gripes have to do with the usually glitches from certain apps and inconsistent (weak) wi-fi, as I'm usually using it at night, reading, etc. and our router (about to be replaced) is at the far end of the house.  It was an unexpected surprise for Father's Day ;)"
Great !
"My other Kindle was stolen, Called Amazon and within two days I had my new one, A+++++++ service."
I absolutely love this Kindle. Using it now.
It works expertise I pick it up and it has great battery life.
"best tablet ever, says my 10 yr old"
Annoying advertisements every time it is opened. Often requires research to learn each component. Inefficient organization compared to a laptop. Sometimes says it must wipe all memory to boot up; then boots up correctly after multiple attempts to restart. Volume sets to zero unexpectedly.
I love it. I've been watching movies and reading books while on vacation. Also checking emails. I'm very happy with my purchase. Thanks.
Was a gift for me Am very happy except for needing some sort of training manual The person who bought it for me doesn't have time to teach me So all I can do is trial an error I am a senior citizen
"I like the feel, and it is easy to print documents."
"My husband purchased my first Kindle when they came on the market and it worked well for several years until the battery decided it wouldn't hold a charge.  I purchased my Kindle Fire as replacement and it has been a consistent pain.  It will shut off when the battery reached 56% reserve, you start it again and it will run until you reach 45% reserve and on and on until you finally run battery down.  Have done all the things the tech department told me to do and of course by the time you have called them numerous times the warranty is out so you are stuck with a Kindle that is barely functional.<br /><br />Received email from customer service 2 days after this review was posted and they ask me to contact Kindle support - results of call is that they are sending me a new Kindle since I had some time left on warranty.  Hopefully this replacement will hold a charge better than my current Kindle."
Sorry I purchased it.  I needed a replacement for my 2nd Generation Kindle & was told all my books & games would transfer over.  I have since found this is true of books but not my games.
"Still learning more about it, but great for my application"
Definitely like my daughter's ipad mini better!
I just love it! The screen is big enough and so clear to see what you are doing!! I love Amazon delivery it seem like I order and then it's right there!!
"Very disappointed.  This is my 6th kindle and I have loved all of them except this one.<br /><br />This kindle will not hold the charge for more than 4 hours.  In additional the power cord is not long enough. Needs to be at lease 5 feet, not 3 feet."
Love it
Was a gift for my granddaughter who enjoys reading so and to continue to encourage reading the excitement was in the air when she unwrapped her gift  Thank you
"It has been fine , the kids seem to like it, I'm just spoiled to the way an iPad works & is payed out. But the kindle does get the job done, streaming videos is the kids BIG thing , so like I said it does what I bought it for:-)"
"I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to use this product on the airplane. I tried to download apps, but the 8 GB doesn't have enough storage. It's great for home use."
like the size of the kindle n the pictures that it takes r good
I love my kindle fire.  This one works great but I will say the one I previously bought was only just over a year old and died.  Tried everything I could find on the internet to get it started and nothing.  I only download books from Amazon.  I have no apps.  I don't play games on there and it just died.  I am going to try to bring it is somewhere and have it looked at but I could not exist without a kindle so I bought a new one.  If it happens again I will probably look for a different brand tablet.
"I read up on this product before buying. I wish I'd heeded the warning of battery longevity. Meaning &#34;there is none&#34;! I can't believe how fast the battery goes down and how long it takes to charge. My old Kindle was a work-horse compared to this one. Would I buy again? I'd shop around before then. Does it work? Yes, but if the battery is always dead what good is it?"
"FireHD7 is the Tablet easy to use ,fast enough that meet my needs.I m please that I have it"
Had to return because it did not work properly
"Great for reading, checking social media, & playing games to pass time.  Easy enough for small children to use as well."
he doesn't have it set up yet but loves it
Got it as a gift for my mom and she loves that it has a camera on it!
"This is my fourth Kindle.I bought this one for my grandson, and he love it.!"
"Good but lack of Google Play Store limits applications to Amazon Apps Store and the app I wanted for my F250 Diesel OBDII, Torque Pro, only resides on Google Play. Can't we just have Amazon and Google play nice together, please. I am happy with the tablet otherwise, great price and product. I would like to see an upgrade to the Second Screen to be compatible with other than Samsung Smart TVs, that is very limiting."
I love it
Love it!!
The Fire HD is a nice electronic pad. A definite improvement over my original Fire.  I will really enjoy this upgrade.
My name is Charles I use fire He I like very much still learning how to use it.
Father's Day gift that was very well received by Dad! He loves that he can watch TV and movies on here. He can't wait for football season now!
"It's great, but wish it had 4GLTE capabilities, Easy to read on the beach, just wish it had more storage as well."
I have enjoyed it so far - the graphics are great and I have found aps that meet my needs.<br />My one disappointment has been the ads - they are distracting and annoying
Great tablet. Only wish it would mirror like the hdx.
"LOVE my Fire HD 7. I love that you can do everything on it from reading, to listening to music, to watching movies, playing games, and more! It is very easy to use and to navigate. Beautiful color and display when playing games or watching movies. Also love the Kindle Free Time option for kids. Great product that I would recommend to anyone!"
"Great Store, service and product! First time purchasing this for my mom and I have to say I'm very impress with with it and will purchase some more at that great price as gifts."
"Love, love it...."
Really nice and easy to use. Definitely worth the money!
"Love the Kindle Fire HD 7, but HATE the adds. Amazing deal and love that it's lightweight."
It's a good tablet but I couldn't view my photos that were backed up to the cloud unless I was connected to WiFi.
"I have 2 older kindle HD, so I figured this kindle would be similar. I really liked the updated format of the screen and the layout option for the start screen with icons and the carousel. This kindle had a few new features like the firefly and settings for individual users. This kindle has a nice clear pictures and was easy to use."
Gift for my Mom & she loved it!
Awesome
"I love this Kindle and the fact it ties Amazon and products, both free and purchased in one place. Simple to use even for the uninitiated or computerphob! Highly recommended!"
"Glad I had purchased an extended warranty, because the original Kindle I had sucked ! This one is much better & has a camera too. Still wish it came with a paper user's manual. It depends so much on a WiFi connection & this single mom often has to choose between needs and wants. This Kindle was originally purchased for my daughter to use for public virtual school."
It's amazing
"After having used it for a few weeks now I can say that I'm really pleased with the build quality and performance.  The problems I've realized are storage space and the limitations on what apps can be installed.<br />My wife thought that the 8GB of space would be enough, but what we've come to realize is that it's enough only if you are entirely cloud-centric.  Without an SD slot the Fire fills up very quickly with apps and there's no room for me to copy movies to it fro road trips.<br />I went to put Google Hangouts on the Fire so that my daughter could IM me during the day and without rooting it or using a wonky sideloading method there's no way to install Hangouts and some other apps.<br />The Amazon-proprietary flavor of Android take a little getting used to, but it's OK."
"Good product, fast response."
"I love the new camera feature, that it rotates.  I am disappointed though at the battery life.  It is not as strong as the other kindles we have.  The battery does not last all day, even when not used.  Is this normal or possibly a defect?"
Too many unwanted items show up beneath carasel that I wish would not. I have to constantly go through the &#34;not interested&#34; routine to remove them. A pain.
"The only reason I am not giving this item five stars is for two reasons. The battery drains a little more quickly than I'd like and there are numerous apps I can't download. (Yelp, Instagram, Fandango)"
"It is OK. I am new to using a Kindle. I wish it came with a link describing how to use the device to read books, watch TV shows, & how to view movies without jumping in to financial commitment. One thing that I do know and find disappointing is it comes with a wrong case. The case covers the camera lens. I was able to purchase a correct case for my 8&#34; Tablet. I know the correct csse exists. It just took some searching. The effort was not put into locating the correct case for the kindle. It did come pre-loaded with Amazon advertising. I love the fact that Android uses the same charging equipment for all devices."
"I am totally in love with my notebook. After trying two other ones and returning them before finally by buying my Fire HD, I am completely satisfied with the Fire HD 7."
"Slow, constantly shuts down and asks if you need pages restored, losses connection.I hate it.never again."
Can't make it work
my second one. good product.
Only had installed one day but seem to be a better fit with my Balogistic case than some other brands I've used.
Wish the os on the fire worked with more apps like my android phone.
The hardware may be all right but the lack of a detailed Users Guide is a bummer.
"The Kindle Fire is great; however, when I registered it, I noticed it said Betty's Kindle 5.  I already have a Betty's Kindle 5, will this cause any problems?"
A fine piece of technology!!!
I love Kindles and upgrading to this one was the best move yet.
I love Fire HD 7. I use it to test my apps.
I wish the battery life was longer.  The Kindle Fire is an excellent device.  It has met all of my expectations.
"I really like it. But, the battery has to be recharged daily."
I like my new kindle fire.  As soon as I have my email on the devise it will be perfect.
not what I expected - have returned it.
Haven't had any problems with it. Works well.
"I have several devices. From laptops, cell phones. Ipads, pcs, servers etc... my kindle is by far my fav.<br />This new gen 4 is muuuuuch better than the previous years (2013) ....<br />no freeze or lag or random reboots. Sleeker, has a decent if nice camera (finally!).. not great pics, but now i dont have to do pics with phone and the transfer when using apps.<br />So far very happy. They arent as high tech and proficient as a tablet like iPad, or Samsung, but for a reader, or watching GOT streaming it works very well!<br />Now if they would just get a better selection of Kindle Ulimited books I'd be happy as a clam!"
sucks the touch screen
"Kindle Fire HD 7<br /> I received my Kindle as a gift from my aunt for graduation. I would never have bought this for myself. I have heard nothing but good things about it like great lightening and high definition, easy access to all social media, and portable with lasting life battery. I had high expectations for my Kindle. As an avid reader I was so excited to have a portable device for my reading habits. When I received my kindle and began messing around with it, I have been somewhat disappointed in the all-around product.<br /> The product is very portable and has great lighting and definition. With it being portable I can take it anywhere in my purse. It’s about the size of my hand spread out and only weighs about a pound an half with a case on. The brightness of screen is adjustable and really helpful when in various lighting. Whether it be outside or indoors I can still see the screen.<br /> The main thing that disappoints me about this product, is the inability to change the lock and home screen. I might not have such a problem with the screen if there was a default picture but there is not, it is a different advertisement each time I go to slide open the screen. I find it annoying when there is a different screen each time I want to open my kindle up. “You can't even choose your own wallpaper or lock wallpaper. You have to pay to get rid of the ads you see every time you turn it on.”  I have searched the internet and it seems that there is no way to change it.<br /> Another bad thing that I don’t like is the battery life. The hold for the battery life is not that great. I take it off the charger and it immediately begins to lose the battery hold. For a portable reading device I would have liked something that would be able to hold a full day’s charge, if I don’t turn it off after every use I can only get maybe 6 hours out of it.<br /> I would defiantly think twice before purchasing this product, if you want something portable and just for fun oruse to shop online this could be your electronic device. If you want something you could use all day for multiple things I would maybe look at another product. This one is probably not the best product and I would give it like 2 out of 5 stars"
"Where I purchased it, it was not specified that this was the model with &#34;special offers&#34;."
Battery dies while not in use. screen is not as responsive as I hope it was. Device gets very warm while being used for a long period. The camera is terrible. But it shipped fast and ahead of schedule.
"I'm irritated that Amazon charges $15 to prevent your lock screen from consisting of ads. I didn't pay the $15 but I wish I had, the ads are really annoying. I'll keep it but I think I would've been happier overall with a different type of android tablet."
"So far I really like it! I wish it could also get Google Play apps and I could change the background and lock screen pictures, but other than that I really have no complaints as of yet."
"It's alright, way too many advertisements though. I mean, I already bought the thing and have Amazon prime how much more do you want from me? Also, programs keep crashing on me when there's nothing else open."
"Nice clear screen and working smoothly.  Haven't done a lot of online browsing yet, so I can't comment on that.  My only complaint is the battery which needs to be charged daily, if device is left on and you read for a few hours.  My old, simple Kindle literally went weeks without needing a charge."
Love it!
So far it's been good sometimes it's not responsive well enough
Enjoying it very much.
The HD is new to me but this one was supposed to have 8 GB of memory and it only shows 1.62 GB for my files which include the OS and 3.44 GB as free. This is not 8GB this isn't even close I hope that amazon cloud storage is really unlimited because you will need it.
husband loves it!!!!!!!
It performs as I expected.
"This rating is based strictly on my specific needs not being met by the tablet device.<br /><br />I sent it back the day after I received it. This was on a special deal so I snapped it up, hoping it could do what I needed it to do. Our family owns an Amazon Fire TV. After doing extensive research, I read in several online articles that this Fire tablet would be able to mirror to my TV through the Fire TV. However, that ended up being not true. It wasn't true even a little bit. I tried to run the mirror functionality through YouTube and multiple other apps. However, after a call to Amazon support, the customer service rep and I discovered that the only thing that you can mirror is the Amazon Prime video app. To be blunt, that is silly. The Amazon Fire TV already does that so why would mirroring for this app even be necessary most of the time?<br /><br />Luckily, Amazon support handled the matter swiftly and my refund was taken care of completely within a few days. The tablet itself works well. It was a bit unintuitive and I did not like the layout of the functions but I could see why others may like it. It seems to be a good deal at the price offered."
returned it
I don't need to buy an expensive tablet when this does exactly what I need. Amazing battery life. I recommend the kindle to everyone. Just wish the app store had more to choose from. Shipped incredibly quickly
I can't retrieve pictures posted on the web that are free
We did not get the special offers so on Father's Day it was disappointing that he could not watch a movie and try out some unlimited books.  I called customer service they said they fixed but the problem seems to be if I have a kindle and I buy one for someone else and pay for it then that person does not get the special offers.
Very satisfied.
It is perfect. This is my third one each one just gets better.
"Love it, met all my expectations!"
Is very nice
I love it faster than my old  dose lot more.I'm on it all timeless
Love it!!!!!
I had the first gen Kindle fire. This is about the same size but theven screen quality is amazing. I love how it's so compact and easy to take anywhere. Definitely a great buy
"I love my Fire  7&#34; HD.I love it so much I have given one to my best friend, daughter & sister for their birthdays & for my grandson for his Christmas. They were thrilled."
It's better than expected very happy to have bought it!
"works very well, the old one we still have that was replaced by staples on<br />service contact has never been good, will never shop at syaples again had very much trouble and expence at local staples."
"I am really enjoying my new Kindle so far.  I had an older Kindle fire, one of the first;  so I have been impressed with all the improvements that have been made.  Love the HD display!  I still haven't tried everything, but I will get around to it all eventually.  I think that it was a great price for everything you get!  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering a tablet."
Lovin It!
I wish I bought the higher grade with more memory
"Wish it was bigger, does everything expected. Nice resolution and quick process speed."
"Kinda thick. My wife has a Kindle Fire HD 7 from 2012 and it is sleek with smooth rounded edges. Feels really nice in your hands. This one is chunky. Quite a bit thicker than the model from 2 years ago and doesn't feel great in my hands. However, it runs smooth, the speakers are great, and I don't have any other complaints other than the ergonomics of  this model. Also, when using facebook and listening to music at the same time, the music will fade in and out while I scroll through the posts. Also, the videos don't play automatically in the posts (like they do on all other tablets I've used). They play for about 1 second and then freeze. The yellow is dope."
Kindle fire is very nice. Put sure didn't get any special offers lied to about that one
I bought this for my wife for mother's day. She absolutely loves it.
This item was a gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it and uses it daily. Excellent purchase and an excellent item.
"I have a Paperwhite Kindle which I enjoy so much, so I thought I'd get a color Kindle for looking at more magazines. I wish I had gotten one with 3G. I miss having the ability to shop for books whenever. So not a reflection of the Kindle's performance, only that 3G gives one more choices."
"Love the Kindle, I have two, my wife has two and our six year old has one. Just the right size. Great pictures for movies...excellent sound system. Nice pricing."
"My first tablet, but not new to the Kindle line (two Kindle Paperwhite readers previously).  Not new to computers either!  I must say that I am impressed.  I know technology moves fast but, wow, compared to the first tablets of the late 1990's this thing is way cool!<br /><br />My only criticism is the User's Guide that comes with the Fire HD - &#34;a whole lot to be desired&#34;.  There is a companion book (The NEW Kindle Fire HD 6&7 User Guide) that Amazon would do well to include in the bundle.  Your level of knowledge aside, this is a great book because it explains your Fire quite well.  Hey Amazon, you reading this!!!  Take the hint!<br /><br />Back to the device itself.  Although I don't use smart phones (still use a land line) due to cost, this tablet will even let you Skype, email, etc.  I haven't used Apple products since the mid-1980's for technical reasons, so I have little to compare this tablet against.  Then again, why would I want to - it's got everything I think we need.  If you're looking for a tablet I HIGHLY recommend this one."
It freezes up quite a bit. Or it will just shut itself down.
"Great for:<br />Reading<br />Netflix(ing)<br />Pinterest<br /><br />Not so good for:<br />Emailing<br />Taking pictures<br />Browsing the internet<br /><br />I wish:<br />It charged faster<br />Allowed google apps such as, gmail, chrome & hangouts"
Perfect birthday gift for a sweet 8 year old.
Fantastic. I am thoroughly enjoying my new Kindle Fire HD 7
I love it. I love all the features on it.
Bought this for my 78 year old non-techie Mom!  With some simple coaching she loves it.  SOOOO user-friendly and the Amazon staff are amazing.
"Just getting into it, but so far very good. I love"
"The Kindle was fine except for one thing. The camera did not take good pictures, they were very grainy. So I returned it to you for credit. You handled that return very nicely.  Thanks."
Can you get Google apps and can you delete apps very well
"Everything I hoped and more.  After dealing with the repeated issues effecting my iPad 2 for several years, it has been a refreshing change working with a device that performs as promised.  My Fire HD 7 has enabled me to access all of my digital content in a perfectly sized package.  Bravo!!!"
Awesome!
"This tablet is awful.  I've had experience with quite a few tablets, and this is the 2nd worst I've laid my hands on.  It is so dumbed down.  You can't even choose your own wallpaper or lock wallpaper.  You have to pay to get rid of the ads you see every time you turn it on.  Who needs a whole carousel full of recently used apps?  I ordered this for my mother because of the name brand, and had hoped it would come with an Android OS.  No such luck.  Even for someone like me who is very experienced with electronics, this tablet it really confusing.  There's also a bunch of apps that I have on my Dell that, because of the difference in the OS, that can't be downloaded onto the Kindle.  Spend the extra few dollars and get a different tablet.  You'll be glad you did.  The one I have now is a Dell Venue.  So simple to use, and I pretty much hate Dell, but the table is easy as heck to use.  The Kindle, not so much."
"nice portable size. miss sizing font with fingers like apple.  does not switch off every 10 seconds like ipod. works great, sounds good."
great gift for my husband.  He seems to be dazzled by it.
love it of course..:)
I am enjoying this device.
I like it . My grandson loves it
"I purchase my Fire HD-7 at my local Navy Exchange 3 months ago and I love it,  in fact my wife grabs it every chance she get because she likes it better the her $600.00 Samsung tablet."
Love it! Quick response time and wonderful picture
Just love this- it goes every where with me
Lost my Kindle in a flood and love the replacement.  It is much lighter than my original.
"Much easier to carry than my laptop, like the fact that sig ins aren't needed every time I go to a page."
everything i need in one little package
Beautiful piece.  I love my Kindle.
"Not as good as the iPad. It is thicker and heavier but the display is amazing. I use it manly for reading books and magazines but for business purposes, I still think the iPad is better."
Does everything but place phone calls!!
I love it!
Really easy to use.
The browser crashes....a lot. Other than that it seems ok.
"I love it, I should have bought one sooner and I should have bought two at the HOT price when I had the chance."
It does not hold the charge.  It freezes up when playing games or when downloading.
I love it!
The price is right
"Wasn't expecting to like this tablet as much as I do.  Great for video streaming - loud speakers with crisp volume and bright, HQ screen.  Really a phenomenal tablet for the price."
Wow! Bought one for my wife and I believe she loves it! She'd never admit it but her face is buried in it whenever she has a free minute. I think she loves it!
Light weight but very versatile. Easy to set up and use. Love it.
Got it for my daughter's birthday she absolutely loves it
Awesome  clear display. Fast as heck to boot  just needs a sd slot or usb port
"I've owned and used more expensive tablets, including the full size iPad and the pure-Android Nexus 7.  But after getting a Macbook, my need for a tablet diminished substantially except in one area: reading books, magazines, and documents.  The Fire HD, at its price point, turned out to be just right for the job.  I can access my Kindle library, my Wired subscription, and my national newspaper of choice, but the Fire also allows me to check in on email and follow my favorite blogs. not to mention listen to my Amazon Music collection and podcasts.  The processor doesn't lag and the HD screen looks great, whether I'm looking at text or photos (haven't used it for video yet).  And with so much of my stuff in the cloud, the 8G of storage are no issue."
"I love my new Kindle Fire.  My old one was about one of the first ones that came out years ago.  The lighted background is wondeful.  The print is so easy to the eyes.  Hate to throw my old one away, but it died.  Thank you, Kindle.  Sandy"
Just having a difficult time finding my way around.  I'm not the most tech savy person and would have preferred some kind of written directions with it to get me started.
very clear nce and handy case
"Just love my Kindle.  I named this one Kindle Fire 2.  I still use my 1st Kindle Fire.  I've divided all my books and things between both kindles.  Now, Kindle 2 has the camera, which my first kindle did not have.  My daughter gave me both, since she knows I love to read A lot."
Does everything I need in a tablet awesome camera and the grandchildren love downloading their games
Great lil tablet
Love it!!
"Excellant tablet! love the front and rear cameras. I have 2 Kindle fire hdx 7 tablets and can't understand why they don't have front and rear cameras, it's a great feature."
"It's good, but the battery seems not very stable, I charged it to 100% and leave it there without using it, after a day, I want to use it, and I found the battery drop to 27%, which is not acceptable... also, I felt very annoyed by the advertisement every time I open it. Due to the above reasons, I returned it after couple days."
Awesome
I have to amend my review. Only certain books are difficult to navigate. A thank you to the person who commented. It made me look further and not give up. The screen is more sensitive. Might have to go to stylus.
"Love the kindle with prime, so many freebies."
Love it!
Love the purple!
Love it
"I love my Kindle Fire HD 7 except for that face that I was not able to put the Hoopla App on my pad.  I wish I would have know about this before ordering because I have a library card and was hoping to take advantage of all the free stuff Hoopla has to offer. It says that you can download the app with a Fire HDX.  Oh well, live and learn."
Very pleased.
So far this has been a really good tablet.
enjoying so much!
Very easy to read.  Need to work on learning how to use it
"Purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband. He was an is absolutely thrilled with it. The ease of the world in his hand. He isn't a huge reader, I am working on him, but it is nice that he can do so many different things with the Fire. I just ordered one for myself. I had the original Fire and was so excited about this upgrade."
"Love it. I use it for reading, watching Netflix and playing games."
"I haven't figured out all the specifics of the kindle, but it seems to be a very good value for the money."
Seems to work good price is right
"I have had several Kindles that I was happy with.  The last one was a Fire HD. I ended up returning the newest one. I did not like seeing the ads every time I logged in rather than a screen saver and there was no way to disable the ads. So I ended up with a Samsung with Kindle software. Interestingly, I don't have to deal with the ads on the Samsung and have more functionality for the same price.<br /><br />Also, I'm able to adjust the screen lighting so I can read even in bright sunlight. When I was experiencing problems with the Fire HD in the past I was told to buy a Kindle Paperwhite in addition to the Kindle Fire HD I had at the time."
"I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas to enjoy Amazon Freetime.  I had two of 3 older ones that my family loved but I have 5 kids so three wasn't enough.  The way the older Kindle's worked with Freetime we loved it.  I hate these things!  I mean HATE these two new ones!  First off when it says 8GBs it really means about 3 GB for you to actually do anything with.  Second the way Freetime now works you are required to have an internet connection in order to open the program.  If you don't have internet, you are not allowed in to Freetime.  Those fun apps your kids downloaded to the system through Freetime are now stuck within Freetime and you cannot access them to play or delete until you go back into Freetime.  AGAIN, You cannot enter Freetime unless you have an internet connection.  If you are on the road and something happens where the kid gets them self out of Freetime too bad, you can't get back until you find internet.  This happened REPEATEDLY on our road trip.  Daughter was playing a game in Freetime and decided she wanted to do something else.  Pushed the home button which is supposed to take her to Freetime home but instead kicked her out of Freetime and sent her to the regular home page.  Now she can't get back into Freetime to play her games because she has no internet.  The other problem is the lack of space.  If your child downloads too many apps in freetime it will complain there isn't enough space, then turns off the wifi and won't allow you back into freetime because there is no internet. Now you can't delete the apps because they are locked away in freetime, you can't get into freetime because there is no wifi connection, you can't get a wifi connection because there isn't enough space, and you can't free up space because the apps taking up the space are stuck in freetime.  See the problem.  Even though I have enough Kindles to go around for my kids, they still fight over the old ones because those are the only ones that work properly.  If you plan to use Freetime DO NOT BUY THE 8 GB!you plan to use Freetime DO NOT BUY THE 8 GB!"
"Drama Fever app not available, battery life is terrible, system has crashed repeatedly and the screen has a mind of its own. Bought this as a replacement to our older Kindle, no where near the earlier quality. Will return unit and hope for better luck with replacement."
"Do not drop these.They cant handle a fall from any height,much less a fall down stairs like the commercial."
Love it
"It's okay, should have gone back to the 8.9."
I like it
"This thing absolutely SUCKS!! I bought it on special for my kid, who's birthday is today, and it's the worst, hardest to run electronic I've ever owned. We hate this thing, what a piece of junk.<br /><br />Save your money and get an iPad."
"I'm just learning how to use my new Fire HD 7.  So far, I LOVE it!!!!"
"I love my Fire HD  and do love the games but I am not pleased with the games being connected to Facebook. I was on facebook  for quite awhile and  because of the people with such foul mouths and bad  manners, I resigned and have no intention of going.  I love playing Spades plus but can't do it properly because I will not join facebook. I love bingo, and a lot of the others but have put them back and forget them. Facebook needs to have some quidlines .  Even on some of the games I had there was foul mouth replys. I do not approve of these and will not participate.  I will keep my and download it with other items."
Was delivered quickly and works great! Father loved it and we plan to buy more.
Works great for the things I use it for. YouTube and some games. Battery is pretty good
"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it doesn't seem to turn on easily. You have to hold the button in longer than what I feel is normal. The USB cord that comes with it needs to be longer too.  Otherwise, I really like several of the features that my previous kindle fire hd didn't have. The books now have a nice easy way to put them into collections. I also like the editing features with the camera. Many nice editing tools now. I am slightly disappointed that one of my games won't play on this kindle though. I don't think that's an Amazon issue though. All in all, I am happy with my purchase. This is the 9th kindle purchase for me, and I wouldn't buy anything else. The service department is amazing 24 hours a day!"
I bought this to use in the car with my daughter while traveling.  I download a lot of prime shows for her to watch.  This was a life saver on our last 10 road trip!
Certainly not as great as the initial Kindle.  Many new features stink.
"It's definitely not an Ipad...but for the price, it does what I need it to. E-reader, internet, and a few games...worth the lower price tag."
Like  very much
Absolutely love this
Just perfect for our needs! Works great for Amazon shopping..reading..checking email and games..love it!
"My granddaughter loves it!!<br />I love it !!!! I want my own. The volume is great and everything comes up very fast when we search , color is great !!! I will be buying my grandson one next"
I LOVE my Kindle Fire!!!
I wanted to stream some videos and the sound is choppy and it buffers a lot. I have a different brand that runs good so I am not very impressed with the Fire.
"Very pleased with this purchase! I use my tablet infrequently (maybe 4x/week?) and while I can figure out new technology better than my 65 year old mom, it still takes me awhile. It's quite intuitive but it does seem to be a bit slow (compared to my phone). I also seem to have some issues putting digital copies of books from my old [defunct] tablet onto this, which is annoying because I was in the middle of a book and would like to finish what I was reading. However, this could easily be user error.<br /><br />Easy to use and the price was right (when on sale)."
Love it
Wonderful product
the kinlde is great!
Bought it for my autistic son. It is perfect for him. The carousel style app display really makes it easy on hom.
"So far so good, a step up from my previous kindle, love that I can take pictures and videos and much more storage space for my games"
"This is my third kindle fire.  I really like the color.  It's a bright, pretty, pink.  Unfortunately, at 8 GB it doesn't hold much if you like to play games.  I like to play point and click adventure games, and I can't have more than two downloaded, and my books at a time.  So, it's not really great for gaming.  That said, I really wanted a kindle for reading.  My last two kindles just kind of. . . died.  They stopped charging and holding a charge, and no new charging cord would fix it. I was having surgery and wanted something  that I could use, and these went on sale. I will probably keep it for my occasional point and click games and go ahead and buy a paperwhite for reading.  Not great for me, but really good and easy to use for my daughter, which is who will probably be using this the most."
Texas hold.em a little SLOW.
This is the 4th Fire  I have ordered -- this one for my Mom. Love them all.  It is perfect for her -- easy to use immediately.  Love the front and back cameras and the screen and graphics are awesome.  She is very happy as am I.  Another great product.
I really like the Fire HD 7. It is a beautiful product. The folder is another thing.  It is made for a left handed person and I am right handed.  I had to cut some space to connect the head phones and to charge it.
"I feel we need much more help in using this article than provided. I'm sure we're not getting to use it to its full potential.<br /><br />However, my wife uses it to read her Nora Roberts books, and seems to be using it all the time. So I guess she's happy with it !"
"I'm still exploring the options, but so far I am thrilled with the Fire HD 7."
Very satisfied.
Love having this Fire HD! Something light to carry around with me.
Overall I like it. It does seem to chew up battery life fairly quickly.
Excellent Kindle! HD is AWESOME!!!! Graphics quality is perfect.
Best upgrade ever!!!
Great device with ease of use with portability.
loving it!!!!!!
Love my Kindle Fire!!
The display is very sharp.  I rusing this device.  Very easy to use.eally enjoy
Love it
Very happy with my new Fire HD 7
"Bought this and two others for the grand kids and just set them up.  Wow what a difference from my older kindle fire.  Like the cameras, one in front and one in back, and just about everything is quality to the max.  Compared to the Samsung is night and day, go kindle, or don't go at all.  I have been letting my grand kids use my older kindle and they love it.  So getting the 4th generation should send me into grandpa loving heaven, which I know they will enjoy them immensely."
Love my Kindle.  Great size.  Fast delivery.
"I love my new Fire HD 7,7&#34; HD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB.  It has met all my expectations.  I bragged so much about it that my good friend, just ordered one just like it.  The photos that this Fire takes is spectacular.  The quality is great.  Can't brag enough."
"Oh my, this is great, I love it !!"
more than I though it would be I like it
"I bought the Fire HD 7 to take on an upcoming trip to Alaska.  I have an iPad,but as I have neck issues, I wanted something smaller and lighter to carry.<br />So far so good.  It was easy to figure out and I am well on my way to enjoying its use."
"I thought when I puchased the Fire Hd that it came with Free Prime for a year. I must have been mistaken because after I bought it, It said one month Free trial. So If I'm supposed to get a Free year I'm sure Amazon will fix it . Other than that I like The Fire HD 7 very much"
I like the fire HD.it is great..I like the screen and the keyboard is just the right size...
I had a Kindle Fire that I loved...it only lasted about 1.5 years then completely died.  So I got this one to replace it and I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />It does not hold a charge - even in sleep mode.  Went to bed at 83% last night...put it in sleep mode (hit power button)...7 hours later it was at 35%!!  That is rediculous.  I used my last one for 2-3 days before needing to charge it. This one will not last long at all.  I used to use it for an alarm clock.  I guess that's out unless I keep it charged at all times.
This was a gift for my 10 year old and she loved it. :)
Wonderful little device!
My son's school got this for him as a graduation gift. All I can say is that it works great.  Wonderful app. No complaints on my part.
Excellent tablet for a reasonable price
I really like the Kindle fire HD. I am looking forward to learning more about it.
Love it
My sister loves it!
Great tablet..does everything i need
Awesome I love the kindle fire
I love my Kindle! The graphics resolution is wonderful and this tablet fits my lifestyle very well.
Bought it for and love the parental controls. Nice tablet.
Very good machine
WOW!!! I have an iPad but like this better!  Much better display and the sound too!!  Being able to download movies so I can play them on a plane is great as well!
Perfect gift for my little cousin :)
Great little tablet! Good for games & books at the beach.
"I have been one of the earliest users of the kindle. I like to read books and periodicals on the kindle when I get into bed at night. I had the first one that Amazon came out with, it was a true workhorse, and I had the one that they might have called the paperwhite(?) with the controls on the sides, but on the night before I was going on vacation, I dropped it on the bathroom floor and it had screen problems. Because that unit was not repairable and no longer under warranty, I waited a while. When I saw this unit on sale sixty dollars off, for 79.95, with the free shipping for a new unit, I jumped on it, and took advantage of the one day sale. It is a much more sophisticated unit that my previous models, and the pictures are amazing. I love the fact that it uses a standard type charger that we had with the blackberries, and it also fits in the custom made case that someone had made me for the older unit. I got great value on a great machine."
Love my new Kindle fire. So great to have it lighted and am enjoying all the new features.
Love it!!
Ok
"Crashed,  confusing to use,  too small,  slow."
Excellent deal. Good product!
I now have a Bible with me everywhere I go.
Works as expected. Gives my wife a bigger screen than her phone.
I love my  Kindle seven fire very easy to use lightweight and compact.
Live it
"I love this tablet,  it's light weight & easy to hold. I love reading books on it, because it's easier to see than a book."
"easy to use, fast speed.<br />cant beat the ereader.<br />Just wish the youtube app was a little more tablet ready rather than a web browser look."
I love the versatility and dependability of the Kindle Fire
i got this for my Fiancee and she loves it. she is still into reading paper books and all but she enjoys watching shows and playing the games on it. i am very happy with this item
I am still getting used to it. I can't wait to read an e-book on it.  It was a gift; so far so good !
I love my Fire....am still learning to use it.  Only thing I would like to see Amazon put &#34;Gorilla Glass&#34; on the cover as what<br />they have shows every print at a touch and some complaints I have read indicate it can break easily.<br />My Moto G phone has this new glass and is perfect.
"Grandson loves it, needs more instructions with it"
"The missus loves her tablet. On it daily, I am glad she uses it."
did not like the ads. I could not get past the interuption
Really like new features---camera and videos.
i did not get my order
"when I downloaded my games you kept all my earnings  over time  not good  I also have to go all the way up on levels in games. I had to get a second kindle because the first quit  Now I have to go through all my games again, but I do like the kindle very much"
"We bought one of these a few years back for my 7yo and it has held up so well we bought another one recently for my 4 yo. It's awesome because we use educational apps to help build skills like reading, sight words, etc and after they fulfill their educational requirement to us, they can play some games for fun! I'm trying to get them more interested in reading the e-books but for now they enjoy real books :) We also let them view Netflix sometimes from their Kindles and they love being able to pick what they want. The parental controls are great and I felt this was a better choice than getting the kid version since I monitor their use of electronics anyway. They love their kindles so much it helps to motivate good choices in behavior at times too."
Special Offers??? This should be called &#34;Banner Adds&#34;. Extremely misleading. You have to pay another $15 to get rid of these annoying adds.<br />Also the heavy dependence on the Cloud for downloading all the Apps and ???.  Only issue with this is you have to be connected all the time. Not everyone has internet. Also what if you want to take your Fire on a road trip. Can only use it when your close to WiFi... What the ?????<br />Please improve your documentation for installing games and apps on the internal storage of the device.
Good size and good display
Love it!  I had the first generation one and upgraded. It is so much clearer and I didn't even realize the other wasn't clear.  It is lighter too. I just love it!!!
No issues
got it for a friend and he really loves it
Awesome -so much to do -and still learning!
Love this Fire..would buy another if neede.
Better than an I-pad
Great Tablet. Every bit as good as an IPad but not over priced due to a silly logo. Fantastic picture and very durable. Easily worth twice as much.
I had the fire HD and had my son take it back for a Samsung tablet what a mistake I made he took the Samsung back and got my Fire HD back now I am happy again what a waste the Samsung to slow to play the games I like to play.
My wife loves her new kindle. She had one previously and eventually the charger port wore out. She still liked it so well that she wanted another. I think it just organizes things we'll and makes it easy for her to read books. The build quality is good. The screen looks great and it is fast. Hopefully the charger port problem has been fixed.
"I have the first kindle fire and purchased this new version for the updated features. I am extremely disappointed. The storage space is so limited that I can't store any apps, books, audio books, FB, etc. without clearing out everything. My old kindle holds all of the above and so much more with no problem. When I can't have one audio book loaded without deleting everything else (including any apps, Facebook or the web), something is very wrong. Don't waste your money and stick with the original Kindle fire!"
Wonderful
I Love my Kindle Fire...
I really like it!  I can do about anything on my Kindle.  The hot pink color is just great.  You can do anything on it and it is so much fun!
"The look and feel of this fire is excellent. I also really like the size. Its just big enough for a great viewing experience, but still small enough to fit comfortably in your hands."
Love my new kindle!
"My husband and I purchased three of these tablets - one for each of my children. During summer break we send them to enrichment/day camp while we work. We thought these would be a great way to get them to read and reward. Unfortunately, sponsored content that has been deemed &#34;educational&#34; by Amazon is always readily available.<br /><br />INSTALL:<br />We were setting up three tablets at one time so install took us a good 4 hours to get everything lined up. Since we are using the FreeTime parental controls, each profile is available on each tablet. The problem is when one profile updates all three have to update before you can move in. It's time consuming.<br /><br />PARENTAL CONTROLS:<br />Oh, how we had high hopes. We selected 30 minutes of reading time, and &#34;none&#34; for apps and video time. The reading works out  - kids read for 30 minutes then the tablet unlocks and allows the kids to play additionally added games and videos. I say additionally as there are many games and videos pre-loaded onto the system which have been deemed &#34;educational.&#34; The problem is my kids are perfectly happy playing the free games and watching the free videos - some which are questionable in their educational value. There is no way to turn these off.<br /><br />The final straw was when my kid came home and started speaking fairly sassy to me and her father and it turned out the show &#34;Victorious&#34; was readily available for her to watch. Not only did my kid not read, she learned how to be rude to her parents. NO THANK YOU!<br /><br />We will be returning these devices and continue looking for a tablet that requires reading (and only reading) first."
I like it but I wish I could control the all the ads on there too many. not needed
I love it.  In fact I started to you it for the most part instead of the smart phone and to some extent my laptop.  Unless I have to use other windows apps.  The only thing I wish I got larger memory.
"Love it !!! I am using it every chance I get. Its my computer, mp3 player and personal DVD player all in one."
excellent color
I love it.  It replaces my 1st Kindle that was only in black/white and did not have a light.
"I'm very pleased with the fire hd 7, it's my first tablet & it's great."
"I just need to vent because I am very, very upset.  I purchased a new Kindle Fire in June of 2015.  I waited almost 4 years to upgrade, and was very excited to get a new model.  I mostly use the Kindle for reading and game playing, although I also read news sites such as CNN, USA Today and my local site KGW News.  I don't use it for music, or video.  I have to say that out of the 5 or 6 Kindles that I have purchased over the past 10 years, this is by far the most disappointing.  It is very buggy.  It freezes without reason, usually after going into sleep mode.  I will open a book to read and find that the Back and Home buttons don't work, and I cannot access the Settings ribbon.  Sometimes, the splash screen (with the ads) will either display an image that is pinched (very narrow) or stretched (very wide).  If I play a game like Cubis Creatures, and accidently let the Fire go into sleep mode, the game will not usually re-appear when I wake it again - although I can hear it playing in the background.  Sometimes when I open a book or access Settings, I have to wait for 20, 30, 40 seconds before the screen appears.  I have resorted to Force Stopping every app I use (other than the Reader), so that nothing runs in the background that might interfere with usage.  I read quite a lot and may have the Fire in use for 5 or 6 hours - the battery life is too short and I have resorted to keeping it plugged in while I read so that it will not shut down in the middle of an activity.  In order to address most of these issues, I restart this thing at least 3 times a day and am very, very frustrated that I wasted my money  on such a piece of junk.  I will most likely go back to using my 4-year old model, even though it occasionally freezes and has to be rebooted, it is no where near as frustrating and disappointing as the new model."
I have lost my kid to the world of electronic.
"I wanted to put no stars, but I am not allowed. First of all is this: the kindle I bought was ok to use for about six days before the backlight went out of commission. Fortunately, I had the insurance. Unfortunately, Best Buy refused to honor the insurance and fix my device. They also rudely informed me that the sale was over, so they would not be able to replace my faulty device for the same price. I would like to have enjoyed the quad core processor, since it did everything faster, and smoother. However, I do not expect to have a better experience with a new one since my current Fire HD is just par, despite being years older than the HD7."
Easy to set up and use. Clear readable screen. I plan to buy two more for family members.
My kids love this tablet!
For some reason my apps have all turned to a generic icon. Tried to restart to refresh but it didn't work. Insanely easy to purchase (my 3 year old showed me this). Decent looking screen but the OS needs work. In my opinion.... After 17 months the tablet will not power on anymore.
It takes too long to charge. You can't plug  it in and continue to use it while it charges. The on button should be a bright color so you can find it easier. Other than that it is okay.
"i have not had too much opportunity yet to play around on the Kindle but what I have used it, I am very happy. The biggest drawback is the fact that it has a high gloss screen which really is terrible with fingerprints so would definitely recommend an anti-glare protector. Otherwise the operation is very smooth for playing games and does well for reading in a vehicle with changing lighting. The camera takes really crisp pictures. Weighs a bit more than I was expecting but believe it will still be easier on my hands than holding a hardback book since I can lay this down flat or prop it up with either the case or a tablet pillow. I like the bookmark feature very well since I plan to do some massive reading in the near future of some large books. I have not used some of the features yet such as the cloud storage or silk browser but, then again, I planned to use it at the time of purchase as primarily an e-reader and device to play games on while traveling."
Fire is great but battery life could be a lot better.
Good device at a good price.  8GB is small considering games take up a lot of space.
"i think i like it.  overall it is good.  a few times while playing solitare, the screen has frozen up.  no cards will move, can't undo.  have to close the kindle down and repower up.  this is the only app or book that does it.  this is a gen 4.  i had a gen 2 and it never did that."
Love it!!
bought for mom for mothers day.  she loves it.
Simpler than the 2013 model
Love it
I had a kindle fire for three years and  when it no longer worked. I purchased Fire and I love it.  Easier to enlarge pages for information.
"Great product.Its very simple to use,download apps etc. I love my kindle.No complaints."
"What's not to love!?  When I saw a 'sale price' for the Fire HD, I decided to order.  Video / movie clarity and quality is top notch.  I ordered the 16 gb model as I use my tablet primarily for reading and listening to music.  I LOVE the Kindle products.  They just keep getting better and better."
Amazing
"I enjoy this device, use it daily, have no complaints about it."
It stated it was specifically for the Kindle Fire HD7&#34; and it was not.  There was no place for the camera facing me to be seen and the top covered most of the on switch and all of the charging port.  Any ideas on what you can do for me?
Brought this for my 9 year old son and he loves it!
I just wish the tablet takes SD Card other than that I would give 5
Love my kindle.  It goes EVERYWHERE with me.
I bought this at best buy telling the salesman that I did not want any advertisements and they are getting more frequent after seemingly not being there at first.  I am very annoyed and disappointed.  Nothing on the package or display indicated that I would be getting these ads.  This product is awful.
"Prints , better key board, easier to use than previous version, great price. Definitely a winner."
"i hate the ads when i open it, i want my date and time screen back"
I am pleased with the item and with the sale price.  I look forward to purchasing another Kindle Fire HD 7 for the same price.  CA Howard
Great value and works perfectly
"Great price, nice reader! I like the newer features!"
"I've had my Kindle Fire HD for well over a year now and have generally been pleased with it.  I've watched a movie or two, watched countless youtube videos, read lots of books, listened to music and generally it works just fine and has been reliable and fun to use.  The sound quality and the image quality on the screen are all just great, no complaints at all with those things. I love how, on many web pages, you can spread your fingers apart and make the page zoom in.  This is a very helpful feature to have, and I have used it continuously when I'm on Facebook, which I prefer to view the web version, rather than use the mobile or app version.  I spend the vast majority of my time, on this device, in the Silk browser, either on youtube or on facebook.<br /><br />Recently,  I did discover one thing that I was not happy with.  At one point, while in Facebook, when I zoom in on my newsfeed and start scrolling down, once I get past the first few newsfeed entries, the menu on the left begins to overlap on top of the main part of my newsfeed!  It NEVER did this until just a few weeks ago. I have no idea what is causing this or how to make it go back to the way it was, but this is horrendously frustrating.  I have tried clearing my data and cache for this Silk app, none of which have done a thing to solve this problem, and I've lost all my settings and bookmarks in the process...all for NOTHING.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like about this is that you can't see the screen at all outside, not even in the shade.  Very disappointing.  I don't want to have to buy a Paperwhite just to be able to read books outside.  I should be able to get all this in one product but this product just isn't there yet with that capability.<br /><br />I see that the HDX version claims to have improved viewing ability for the out of doors but I hesitate to buy that when that product hasn't been updated since 2013.  I'm hoping that product will be updated sometime this year, with improved capability for viewing in the out of doors.<br /><br />So in summary, it's a very good product, it serves its purpose, but there's still room for improvement.  When the HDX model releases its next upgrade, I'll be purchasing that, along with its external keyboard for expanded capability."
Good tablet. Had to get this one because my other one suddenly blacks out. Had that one almost a year. Hope this one does not have the same issue.
only disappointment was that some of my apps from previous kindle fire are not compatible with new device.  otherwise love it.
"Still have yet to explore all of the features of this new device.  Thus far, I'm quite pleased and will be able to read my books among enjoy other benefits of Prime membership."
"It was a lovely unexpected gift and I am enjoying it immensely. I've had it now for almost 3 weeks, so I'm still learning what it can and cannot do. I do wish a &#34;Let's Get Started&#34; booklet had been included, even just an overview of what is possible. I hate having to go to YouTube, Google or even Amazon to search thru what I thought it could do and what it really can do with the correct wording to get my answer.<br /><br />Also, I didn't realize I'd have to reload my books I want to read, onto it out of the cloud, from my K2 before I leave wi-fi range. I suppose that saves space on it without overload. It's fun to see the book covers in their full colorful glory.  It runs smoothly especially when I go in and out of wi-fi range, and the alerts. That pictures, texts, and graphics are sharp. The pictures I've taken with it are all sharp and very easy to upload. I haven't quite figured out how to send pictures to friends via their email yet or even to them privately on Facebook, but I'm still learning how to use it.<br /><br />The battery life is not as long as I expected. My Kindle 2 could go for almost a week as long as I didn't leave the wi-fi on while I was on the subway reading, while it searched for a connection. The battery life is similar to my phone, but I guess that's because it's so program/software capable. Unlike my K2, I love that I can highlight in various colors. It's also shorter, so I can go back to using smaller bags or even start my day with one bag. That's a real plus for any woman.<br /><br />I do love that a version of Word Twist (Word Mix) is available. That's great! Overall the little things I can't do now are not that bothersome to rate it down. I know it's a learning curve on my part that I will champion. I am very happy with my gift. Thanks LI S15."
"Good tablet except their is too much glare when viewing websites and reading e-mails especially outside. Otherwise, good tablet for the price."
"The Fire 7 Really impressed me, the audio is perfect, and the quality is very high definition. I am a bit younger of age, so the review should not necessarily count, but thanks a lot! This tablet is very useful and I was quite impressed with the Android OS"
Alright
Worked fabulously for one week - now will not turn on.
"So far it seems ok. I'm not sure about a lot of the features, but that's just me. I hope to have some time to play with it soon."
"This is my third Kindle.  The first one is still perfect for reading in the sun.  I especially like the feature that I can use the fire (with white lettering on a black background) for reading a book at night and the new one which I use during the day.  The first fire battery went.  don't know why but it won't even charge enough for me to see anything.  The new one is fast, doesn't drain the battery and is great for e-mails and searches and gmes.  I haven't used for video nor music but I don't do much of those.  I have two tablets and they aren't nearly as nice as the kindle fire hd.  Glad it was on sale."
"Constantly freezes and have never been able to use it much.  Waste of my money, wish I'd never bought it."
"Love the Fire HD, but if you buy it be sure to buy the extended warranty.  I lose the sound on videos and it is so annoying..  I never bought the warranty so I am out of luck with a replacement"
I like!
I am completely satisfied with this new Kindle Fire.  With the help of one of your associates I was able to navigate thru the Kindly easily.  I give your associate Anne G. credit for helping me on two occasions.  I hope you congratulate her.
"Amazon is quick to boast the capabilities of immersion reading as well as Kindle FreeTime.  What they DON'T tell you if that you cannot do immersion reading in the Free Time App.  Not only that, there is NO WAY to play Audible audiobooks in free time AT ALL.  In addition, Amazon has taken away the capability to remove content for a device.  So if you think you want your kids to be able to listen to Beverly Cleary, but not George R. R. Martin, you can not.  I feel like I have been ripped off and as someone who had usually been a big fan of Amazon, I am disgusted!"
i bought my tablet thinking it had 8GB of storage but in reality it only gives you 4.5!!!!!!!! what a rip off!
"Perfect for what I wanted.  Does everything my granddaughters I-pad does.  Of course I'm of another generation, and don't need everything she does, but I'm completely satisfied with it.  I can even watch the Big Brother feed lines.( yep,me too )"
I love everything about this kindle
I love it! It totally exceeded my expectations!
love it
Daughter loves it!
Everything and more.
Graphics are amazing. Would consider another for a gift.
Like my fire kindle
It is like my Fire Phone but bigger screen.  I like it!
Thanks to my family for helping me to get a great tablet.
Great tablet!
Picture and sound are great. Feels good and ready to use.<br />One negative so far. Can not download Android apps only Amazon store apps. The Amazon store does not have most of the apps I want. Could use more memory and an SD card.<br />Still a good deal for the price.<br />Like it so far.
My son loves it!
An excelent tablet.
"It would have been very helpful to have a book or some sort of directions to show me how to use the Fire .With out any directions, I find it very frustrating and I am close to sending it back.  I am not one of those  people who used a computer in their life, so it is very difficult.  If there is a &#34;dummy&#34; for the fire I would appreciate knowing about it.  Thanks, Gail"
Great birthday present
"The color and Fire HD 7, 7&#34; Display is better then the other Kindle I had and to pick the color was very very nice"
It is everything that is necessary for me. Thanks
"This Fire HD 7 was purchased to replace a much used Kindle purchased when they first came out.  That Kindle was dying because of a worn out charging receptacle.  My wife has taken to this new Kindle like a duck finding a june bug.  She loves it.  The color screen means no additional light is needed to read with it.  She can read in the dark while I get to sleep without disturbing me (nice!).  She is on our home wi-fi, which means no data use on ATT's system.  She has a small iPad-like tablet in reality, but she primarily uses her new Fire HD 7 to read novels.  This Kindle is a real step-up, and we are glad we purchased it."
I like it a lot because of the great picture and sound
"Read, record, take pictures, video-tape, search the internet. This Fire does it all!"
This is my 2nd Kindle.  I liked the first and love the second!  I now use it almost more than my laptop.  Thank you Amazon for putting in the second camera.  This feature is very handy!
This is our 4th kindle.  So far this new HD one is working well.  I just hope the charging port last longer than on the original kindle fire
My husband boughtme my first Kindle  4 yrs ago  an just got my  Kindle HD this year love it it so different than my first one  learning to use this one it's definitely different. But very happy with it.
love it so far!!
"In terms of size, it is perfect for my needs.  I'm still figuring out how to use it, but I think I'm in luv with it."
I love the tab
Good product for the money
I love my kindle. When i got it i was a confused while trying to figure out my read/archived books. I have the original kindle so it was simple & basic. I still love this one though.
"I have had 3 years of mostly aggravation.  I bought my first kindle in 2012.  Immediately there was a problem, it wouldn't charge.  Brought it back they gave my another. After 2 months of it freezing left and right, turning off in the middle of doing stuff, I brought it back, it's been months since I bought my first one, so they no longer made that generation, they had ONLY the newest version to offer but I had to pay the difference and the new extra warranty I had bought with my first kindle.<br /><br />A couple of months later it had same issue as previous kindle, it wasn't charging!  Back to best buy AGAIN!<br /><br />I had to pay for another up grade because they no longer sold that generation!<br /><br />So I get the newsest they had at the time, fire hd, right?  It works for about a year and a half, then guess what?!  Yup, charging issue again!  Now that the year is up the only thing they can do for me is to give me a $20 discount off the newest generation,bthe fire hd x, bc of course they don't sell brand new of the one that no longer works!<br /><br />I am not wasting anymore money and time.  All that aggravation was so not worth it.  Get yourself a tablet, download the free kindle app.  Or even check out a Nook.  The charger connection on the Nook is MUCH sturdier.  I wish I had just gotten my money back on the first or even the second or third defective kindle and bought something else instead of getting replacement kindles!<br /><br />Of course, now, I hear that Kindles have been having this battery charging issue for a long time and it was not a fluke, which I thought was my case.  It is widespread and on going.  The connection to charger is very loose and unsturdy.<br /><br />Please benefit from the crap kindle put me through and stay clear of Kindles."
"Great tablet for my daughter! It is simple and easy to use. The price is a great deal compared to other tablets based on speed, usability, and storage. I think she will be able to use this for a while."
"We bought ours less than 18 months ago and used it less than 20 mins 3 times a week. It is dead. Black screen with fully charged battery. Costumer service said, &#34;mourn your loss. There is nothing we can do...we do have other products for you.&#34; I'm done with kindle. I told them l be using the kindle app on an iPad, as they are reliable devices."
The screen is crystal clear and colors are sharp and true.  Easy to use and set up.  The best electronics purchase I've made recently.
"For the price, this is wonderful.<br /><br />Feels chunky and heavy in your hands. Like a real book.<br /><br />She's reading some historical/mystery book on it right now -- her first ebook. :P"
"Love it, great customer care as well"
Great tablet. Down loads fast and is a perfect size. Only negative is the pop up adds that seem to appear.
"Love it!!!!🙌 the camera rocks,plus the video is awesome as well. Good job Amazon, another great kindle!!!😁 thank you!!"
"The Kindle is wonderful--very clear images, so lightweight.  I am enjoying it.  However, the special offer didn't turn out so well.  I was supposed to get a free case, but it was not delivered.  It was from a third-party, so I was not able to get it worked out through Amazon.  That part was disappointing, so I'd suggest just sticking to buying the item and forgetting the rest of the special offer."
"Still learning all it's possibilities, but so far it does everything we want it to do and much easier than our original Kindle."
"I love the new features like Wiki access, being able to create folders and being able to read a book while it is charging.<br />Last year's model could not do these things.<br />I am sure there are additional features I haven't seen yet, but I will keep exploring it."
This device died after 3 days.  Just quit working.  Returned it for money back.  I don't want another one. I'll look into getting an Ipad.
An improvement in visually over my previous Fire.
awesome!
Beautiful clarity of screen. Just wish you had sent the plug for charging the battery!!!!
I love my Kindle Fire.  It is easy to use and the larger screen is fantastic when reading my books.
I am impressed.  This device will get some serious use.
I'm about to return it to the store because it keeps kicking me off.
Im very disappointed with this product....Its very slow and it has lots of advertisement pop ups....im sorry I bought this....
Love it
The only thing missing is Google Apps.
Great
"durable, great for kids, fun colors, easy to use."
😂
Works very good
I haven't had this one very long but so far I really like it.  Had one of the first HD's out and I wore it out so I got this one.<br />So far I give it a big thumbs up.
"awesome.... who woyld buy an expensive Ipad for the kids if you can get this for so much less money? Stable system, skype, facebook, youtube, instagram, no problem..."
Love love love
So advanced am still learnig about it.<br /><br />clarity of text is outstanding.
"A little awkward to handle and use, but in all fairness the problem may be with me. This is my first &#34;toy&#34; and I guess I'm a slow learner."
"It is great.  I picked up where I left off on a book, that was started on y other kindle.  Hot spots are a problem though."
"I'm loving my new kindle fire7.<br />Especially the camera. Now I have everything in one hand. Phone, camera, message,  etc. Thanks!!"
Love my Fire HD 7
Very disappointed in your staff. On June 13 I was told that the fire I ordered was the largest screen available. Also the 10 year old kindle could download daily newspapers without WiFi. This one cannot. Your staff is either poorly trained or incompetent. She should have at least sold me one with comparable features.
"I love my Kindle. I wore my last one out and had to buy this one the night before a trip to New York. I love that there is a camera on the front and back. Videos and pictures are great. You do have to hold it still to process after a taking a pic, otherwise the pic is distorted. The video is very clear. I carry my Kindle with me everywhere. My son and husband each have a version of the Kindle Fire and then I have a Kindle Touch I don't use much as this Fire is my favorite."
"I love the Fire!  I use this every day, mostly to play games, listen to music or watch videos on YouTube.  I only have a few books on it and it works well as a reader.  It's sturdy too, we have dropped this thing several times by accident and it still works flawlessly.  It's small enough to fit in a purse so it is handy to have while traveling.  This is a great product, I highly recommend the Fire!"
Fantastic. My son loves it!
We nice tablet for the price. My 8 yr old loves it!!
"Love it!  the clarity, the camera, the size, its perfect for my needs when my computer is just not necessary."
I have two kindles. I let my dad borrow one of them and he wanted his own. We are both big readers and the fire is perfect to read on. Love my kindle
It was ordered for someone else
I love this Kindle! It allows me to access all of the apps and sites I use and so easy to read with.
Excellent.  Good camera work. Good e-reader.
"l would describe this as an excellent value. Granted, I have no experience with other tablets, but for an entertainment device it's great. I have bad ears, yet the speakers are great, very clear. The display is HD, well duh. What you see in the image is called the carousel. You swipe through it to find what your favorites/recently viewed. I would prefer a screen of icons to the swipe thing, but it works. Battery life is about 6 hours. My only quibble there is that there is no charging indicator. You have to turn it on to see the charge. A quibble since the standard case, in addition to having great look and feel, turns the device on. I have a K3, a Paperwhite, and this Fire. I'm old school. I have ALL my books on my K3, divided into collections. I don't need no stinkin' cloud! That's my library. 500+ books and counting. (Yes, I've read them all.) I used the Paperwhite for my daily reading, but the Fire HD is easily as good as, if not superior to, the Paperwhite for reading purposes. And either I have a really good router or this thing has a really good receiver, but I have no trouble streaming 100&#34; through two buildings. It may take a minute to establish the connection, but once it there it's locked in and performs flawlessly. Bottom line: If you like to read, like to watch videos, into the social network thing, this is an excellent value."
I am very pleased with this model...I had a much earlier model Kindle Fire and this one is a huge upgrade! It runs very smooth and  16 GB of space is great! I have 0 complaints & would highly recommend it to everyone!
"Everything they say it is.  Love the fire HD.  Thought it might render better outside, but I still need to mess with some of the brightness setting to see if I can read at the pool with it."
bought as an anniversary present for my wife as an upgrade on hers. these are great products.
Can be somewhat slow
my first e reader.... wish I had one years ago ... best thing I ever bought for myself....
"I got this device for free from my school, and I was hoping the device would have more storage space. The cloud is crazy you have to pay for space. I do enjoy the reading style and I think it would be cool if you could switch from electronic screen mode to the original kindle screen mode."
Love it
"I originally bought a Kindle Fire first generation when they first came out. I finally broke down and parted with it  The graphics and features on this Fire are excellent ,and as usual the affordability makes this  a complete package. We are a Kindle family. Amazon is the way of the present and the future. Keep up the good work."
"Love, love, love my Amazon Fire!  So glad I bought it!!"
A little small after using a regular size tablet.  Works well and easy to use.
Great!!!! It is wonderful to have once again!
Love it !  Do buy one
love it
"It's amazing, exactly what I wanted."
Very pleased with it.
It's great
"It turns out the Fire provides even MORE than I expected!........It has also become my day planner...and more.  Am able to shop online, check emails, and visit social media.....Fits nicely in my bag and I enjoy quiet reading on my breaks....Very Happy......😆"
"My son loves it , charges fast , downloads easily, uploads easily, its just great ."
I loved my first kindle fire but my kindle HD is great!!
Easy to hold and pack.  Love reading books on it.
Much faster than my previous Kindle.
"Bought this for my 8 year old god-daughter.  It's an amazing way for her to challenge her mind with educational gamed and books.<br /><br />Also the parental controls are excellent.<br /><br />I've had three other brands of more expensive tablets, but the fire is by far a better value."
"I love this product , my nephew spilled sauce on my first one . So I had to purchase another ."
Fantastic
"I enjoy it while it lasted,  last night I was reading a book and I turned of before I went to bed. This morning I turned on to keep reading and didn't go on I thought the battery was low so I plague it on to charge it and nothing.  So I don't know what append  now I need to buy a new HD 7&#34; Display to replace it. Didn't even last me  a year, that is terrible. I have a Kindle Fire that I purchase about almost three years and up to now works great.<br />I guess I need to buy anew Kindle or a new HD  7&#34; not sure which one."
"I have use of just my right hand, and was looking for a tablet that was easy to handle.  This is it!  Using the online instructions, it is simple to set up and use.  Highly recommended to both able and disabled users."
"I really love this. I wasn't expecting much after reading a lot of the reviews and getting a tad  nervous about purchasing it. I bought it mostly to rent ebooks from my library so that I can read while traveling or at work. I was debating sending it back when I found out the library I went to didn't have a ebook lender capable with kindles, but I got a card for a new larger library and now I've been reading like crazy! The ads on it aren't the greatest and a tad annoying, but it doesn't interfere with my ability to have a pleasant read (I only experience ads on the opening screen when I turn it on and enter my password.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fancy device to do apps and games on it, I would suggest a samsung galaxy tablet or an ipad instead, but if you just want to do a lot of reading and browsing your library, this device is perfect! I really do love mine! I just need to get a glass cover now so that I won't be afraid to touch and smear it. Definitely get a case with it that has a pen to avoid fingerprint smears since it does get dirty quickly."
It was a little difficult to learn to use being an Android only user for my whole life but I did finally get the hang of it and my 8 year old daughter who I got it for was able to learn how to use it really fast. It does run really smoothly and is built like its made to go into a combat zone. I have an iPad Air 2 also and other than size it has nothing on the fire.
"Bought it for my mother who is not technically incline, but after showing her how to use it a few times  and  what most things mean. She was able to use the kindle on her own. Still will need help but for an older person this was the perfect gift for her. She loves it which makes me happy I made the right choice for her."
"My kindle fire stopped working after 3 days. It froze and wouldn't respond. Amazon customer service was outstanding, and is replacing it, although it is back-ordered until late July. It seems like it will be a great product from my limited time with it, and I'm looking forward to getting a new one. Bummer to get a lemon!"
HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT IT - LOVE DOING AUDIBLES ON IT WHEN DRIVING ON LONG TRIPS.
Everything it's touted to be! Thanks
Fantastic product!!
What an improvement sorry to replace my old one but pleased by the improvements
I am extremely unhappy and greatly disappointed with the Fire HD 7.I have had it less than two weeks and it is still not functioning to my expectations.<br />I feel that I was coerced into purchasing a new kindle that I was not prepared to do.<br />I detest the way email and spam need to be erased.<br />My carousel continues to disappear and reappear for no discernible reason.<br />I am unable to select the settings I want and despite calls to Amazon and attempting to configure them myself using the Amazon web site there are still issues.<br />The worst problem I have however is the fact that my entire contact list is gone. My email and other information did import properly but not one single contact. This has created a serious problem for me. Considering my contacts were backed up on my original kindle I presume it is an Amazon issue.<br />Frankly I am so unhappy I am considering returning the HD 7 for a full refund unless Amazon can repair my original kindle with no charge for all my trouble. There are other problems I have not mentioned as well.
Love it!!! Clear easy to use. Hours of fun! Great price too!
"Love the device, just would love it more if Google Play Store was accessible."
I am a long time kindle user and when I lost my fire upgraded to the new one. It does a lot of stuff and I hv not fully investigated all that but I am super disappointed with the battery life. Even without wifi if I don't actually shut down the battery is depleted in a dsy. My old fire would be several weeks without shutting down bc I don't use it that long at a time.with wifi I can watch it going down in minutes.
It is very user friendly easy to navigate.
Its been awesome..from books..to movies..Facebook..quality is everything I expected and more!
"More than I expected, perfect"
Amazing. Does not come with the apps it lists. But still amazing I am a ten-year-old girl love the pink one. L-o-v-e it love it.
Son loves it.
Absolutely love it! Display looks great. It does so much more than download books (which I believe is the stigma about Kindles). I use my Rosetta Stone app on it daily.
A lifesaver for my son.  Whispersync is great for promoting reading.
I love it and am so glad I got my Fire.
I would like more instructions in its uses.
Very disappointed in the quality. This is our second and the screen keeps freezing up. Needless to say the kids are not please when they are playing games
I am replacing my old Kindle with this new one as I can not live without it.
I love my new kindle fire HD
"Love my purchase with such a little money I spent, but filled with bundle of surprises. Good picture quality, nice sound output, sleek look, thin yet study casing. It is no less in every aspects in comparison to my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7&#34; function wise, except much less in cost. I am glad that I have made a right purchase."
Love the Kindle don't know why it took me so long to purchase one. I have had amazon prime for years. And this is great! Will be purchasing another since my son took over this one lol
I bought it for my mother.  She is still learning how to use it.
Love it!
It has been fun using this kindle
so far am not happy with it but I've been to busy at work to inquire about it but will real soon
My son loves it!  We got it at a great price and it shipped quickly we received it in just a few days!
just as described.
Love it. Price was great.
Love it!!
"This tablet is great!  Granted, it's my first tablet, and all I use it for is watching movies while flying.  Otherwise, it sits in a drawer.<br /><br />Still, this kind of makes up for Amazon cancelling Unbox, since watching movies would be the only reason I'd take my laptop on vacation.  With this tablet, I can leave my laptop at home, which makes it that much harder to get distracted by work while I'm on vacation.<br /><br />It's solid, works fast, and gave me no problems."
Battery life is short . Seems like I have to charge it often enemy though I changed the settings.
My kids loved these I bought two... Love the colors.. Wasn't able to download Google plus i thought it being an android would allow this and it didnt- so my gift cards couldn't be used but overall happy with my purchase
I like it I want to keep it.
It's taking me a while to learn how to use it.  I do much better with an instruction manual.  I like it and the graphics are amazing.  Looking forward to become more comfortable with it.
"I purchased this primarily as a tablet rather than a book reader. I knew it ran on the Android operating system so I THOUGHT I could use the Google Play store to get my apps from. WRONG! This thing uses it's own kindle store apps and are much more limited in apps. I previously had an android phone and loved the google play store apps. I didn't do my research and only found out after I purchased it that I couldn't download google play store apps onto this device. There is a work-around (sideloading) for getting those apps but it's more trouble than it's worth. The Amazon website proclaims that it's not possible, which is a little misleading. They want you to use their Amazon App store.<br /><br /> I ended up getting an ipad mini as my primary tablet for apps. I already had a kindle paperwhite (which I love!!!) for reading ebooks.<br /><br />For the price, it's not a bad little tablet. The processor is a little sluggish compared to more expensive tablets, but with electronics you get what you pay for. This would be a good tablet for kids."
Only had my kindle a month. It randomly shut off and hasn't turned back on. I have done all the resets and everything suggested online.
Came in as advertised in write-up and in excellent condition!
"I love it!!!! I had the Kindle Fire and upgraded and am so glad I did!  Faster,  better, & worth the upgrade."
I love my kindle.
2nd day of use it would not power up again after a full night of charging.
I'm very happy with my new Kindle!  I liked my last one so much that I ordered another one.  I'm tickled that this new one has 2 cameras.  Now I don't have to take only selfies!  This Kindle does everything I need it to do.  Very dependable too.  And I'm happy also with the Citron color.  It's easy to find!  Love it!
Hard to use and very poorly write online instructions. Get an IPAD
Love it
I like the Fire but I had some problems using the books. I did not know to press on the side to get the first part of a book.
Wished I had one years ago.
"Fun to play with, easy to learn,  need to learn about streaming now."
Great for the money!
"I think I own every generation of Kindle and have been pleased with all of them.  Smooth connectivity, fantastic clarity and sound.  Can't go wrong with this one."
It's ok
It does not get the letters large enough . I am legally blind so I need large letters.
Very good.
Love it.  Great crisp display.  Very good product and value.
*****. Excellent!  5 star
will not turn on. Junk
Love it.  Takes great pictures too!
"poor camera (does not matter umch to me).<br /><br />What I like most is its ability to control child's activities.<br /><br />May be more things parents be able to control the child account/profile from web (remotely). E.g. Today I needed to login toy account on the same device so as to control my child activity. E.g. Changing time limits on activities, parental controls."
"I love my Fire ...so I have now purchased 4 more for gifts...it is a nice size, easy to use and works beautifully!!  I haven't had any problems...that I really like because at my age, technology is often exasperating! !!"
"The Fire is too limited. For example, I can't steam live music from several large classical music websites, you can't download apps from the Google Play Store, etc. Of course, out handles everything from Amazon very well. If i had been aware of its limitations, i would not have bought it. You can get a much more flexible genetic Android tablet for the same price"
Do not charge over night!
"Third Kindle, did not work. I was sent a &#34;NEW&#34; refurbished Kindle to replace this one. Extremely disappointed with that decision. Being &#34;old school&#34; with an attitude, I will close my account once my contract is up. Sad, but it is a matter of trust when you buy on line. I no longer trust Amazon will do the right thing."
Not as good as the first generation. Feels really cheap and the charger sucks.
Works great!
"I've only had my Kindle Fire for a week and I still haven't discovered all its features, but I have to say at this point that I am completely satisfied. My only complaint is that a user's manual might help, but there's probably a document embedded somewhere that explains everything. I just haven't looked for it."
Investigate this before buying<br />Kindle Fire charging port getting loose & then won't charge!<br />😪 We have 3 Kindle HD Fires about 2-3 years now & gave the very 1st Kindle away because of the port Mess. NOW I HAVE 3 Kindle Fire Hds WITH THE SAME PORT PROBLEM! So PLEASE tell me why THESE PORTS ARE SO DELICATE. We have a 1st -2nd & AIR 2 iPad and several iPhones and Never NEVER NEVER have I had an issue with ports! Amazon DON'T LOSE YOUR GREAT REPUTATION!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great.I love it!
Love my new Fire HD 7
Love it
Great upgrade from kindle 1st generation. Glad I purchased.
The case is much too heavy!
Need more space
"Easy to navigate, no issues so far."
Bought a Dell first and hated it. Love this one. Fast easy to use.
Had to return it because it did not have enough storage. Buyers need to know that although it is an 8 gb only has 4 gb worth of storage.
It's a great tablet.
Great tablet. I had the first kindle they can out without color. This tablet is way better due to the light when reading and the color aspect of the tablet.
So far it's been great but we still have alot to learn about it.
GREAT
"Is not user friendly have been trying to down load audible book all day.  User guide is terrible,key board.awful.  horrible  ithis is my third kindle and I was offered an IPad and foolishly rejected to went with this"
Just as good as an I pad
"It is the first one of its kind I have, the other ones don't compare to it and I am pleased with it."
Awesome
I love that it has front and back cameras. I also like the slim design. It's tough too. I have already dropped it once and it didn't miss a beat! I am bummed that it doesn't have mirroring capabilities.
"This is our 3rd Kindle Fire for this house.  It is a great tablet alternative for the kids because they also have access to the Kindle Library as well as Kindle Free Time where you can set limits on how much time you allow for each type of activity.  Also, with the parental controls you can link the device to your account but require a password before purchases are authorized so no sneaky downloads!"
"First off, yay that is has a camera, I can Skype now. But the feeling is soooo plastic! It does not have the rubber casing which was easy to grip, this is plastic and very slippery. The screen is also very reflectve, it seems even more so than the original. I'll probably gift this to the first person who says it looks awesome. It just feels too cheap, and with barely half of the 8GB useable, it has a very limited use."
"Purchased this device because my original Kindle Fire is no longer supported by many apps I like and use. I like the new device, it works much quicker than the old Fire, it hasn't hung-up yet like the old one and has much better resolution and a bigger screen. The battery life doesn't seem as long as the original. I find it a little annoying that there is no power on indicator light but the power switch no longer has the &#34;hair trigger&#34; effect so that prevents accidental power-off. I haven't quite figured out all the default settings (on power-up the sound comes on on the lowest possible volume setting no matter where I had it set last), but I think I'll be happy with the device for awhile (or at least until the next generations of operating systems comes out and the device no longer gets supported like what happened to my old Fire). I could care less about the cameras and almost wish they weren't included but I suppose every darn device today isn't complete unless it has some crappy useless camera in it. If you want to take photos, buy a good camera for goodnesssake!"
I like it but the first unit failed after two months. The replacement sent out was magenta instead of black.
My daughter loves it
"This is my third kindle fire and I find this one easier to use than the first but I am only giving it a two star rating because the battery life is lacking. This kindle has to be charged a lot, sometimes twice a day. Plus the cord that comes with this one is very short so it is hard to use when charging."
I had the first generation Kindle fire but I left it in a hotel room 2 weeks ago so I was forced to get a new Fire. I absolutely love it. It works similarly to my old model but with improved functionality. I have always used my Kindle Fire as my tablet. When I lost the old one I never thought to purchase an IPAD or other tablet.  I'm 100% satisfied.
"Display is nice but lacks an ambient light sensor to auto adjust the back lighting.  Free time blocks the ability to activate Plex in child accounts. No Google apps available.  Ditching the Fire for a Nexus 7, only $45 more and a superior product in my opinion. Plus wireless charging!  Anyone with kids knows it's only a matter of time before they wear out or break the USB port."
"great clarity, lightweight, easy access for my five year old nephew..."
It's really fun !
Hard to read outside.
fire hd does everything. really good with books
Like it
"great gift, received quickly, thank you."
Wonderful high definition display. Versatile. Multi-functional. Nearly replaces my laptop.
love it.
I'm enjoying it very much.
"MY HUSBAND WHO IS VERY CRITICAL, LOVED HIS FATHER'S DAY GIFT VERY MUCH..FIRE HD 7 WILL BE A PART OF MY GIFTS TO OTHERS IN THE FUTURE..."
It is very nice and works great.
Bought my fire HD7 in January now 6 months later it goes blank  nothing is showing on the screen. Tried to press the on button to turn it on but it's not coming on at all.  Try charging  it nothing happens.
The delivery time was great and I love the product.  I've worked on another 7&#34; and was only half satisfied with that.  The Fire is super.
"I've bought two Kindles from amazon: the older paperwhite and the newer Fire.  In five years I've had to replace them five times, collectively.  Constantly the display breaks: pixels misfire, gaps or lines or smears appear.  These products, in my experience, are not reliable.  Amazon typically will offer you a &#34;refurbished&#34; replacement -- ie, it isn't new, and they won't specify how old it is, or where it comes from.  They claim this is acceptable; my track record here says very much otherwise.  Now I'm being told via amazon chat that because my one-year warranty has just expired, I have to spend nearly $200 to replace the paperwhite, whose display just became illegible, for no reason at all.  What a joke -- and it's on me.<br /><br />I use tablets constantly in my line of work, and based on my experiences Kindle devices are far, far behind other rival brands in the field.  Save your money, shop elsewhere, don't invest in a product this unreliable.<br /><br />I urge anyone reading this review to go elsewhere.  Save yourself the stress I've been through."
Pretty solid.
"This Kindle has been an incredible resource for me!  I have been using it only 3 weeks & I can safely say it has changed my life! We live in an area with no cell phone coverage so I've never gotten a smart phone.  Now my day begins with a Bible reading from an awesome app followed by a reading from my Daily Bread app. My time when I'm not watching movies, listening to music or reading endless books is now spent having a blast playing a myriad of word games.  The Kindle has so exceeded my expectations!!"
Have only had a short time so far so good
Met expections
"Totally impressed with the quality, sound and ease of usage.  Great product."
I love my Kindle!
"This is the second one we have owned, and we are having the same problems. It shuts off intermitintly. The last one shut off for good a couple days after the warranty expired. I think we will be sending this one back right away."
Very fast delivery! I love it!
"I've got a Kindle Fire 7, 7&#34; HD Display 8GB (4th Generation) for one of  Anniversary gifts from my dear husband. Some reviews says Dish TV works only on HDX, but it's not true. I've downloaded Dish Anywhere app (free) from Amazon.com, and &#34;Ta-dah!&#34;<br />I would also like to point out about a color of photos on the Kindle. My collections of photos on  Kindle Fire 7 HD looks yellowish compare to Kindle Fire (1st Generation), my very first Kindle. Otherwise, it's lighter, thinner, and I'm able to send e-mails by typing foreign languages. I love it!"
It got here on time and opened up with what i wanted. My only negative is it seems flimsy to me compared to the older generation.
Love it!
"I like the new Kindle, but I am having a bit of difficulty adjusting my books to text size and number of words in order to read at a comfortable level."
"Great product and great value.  - I use it mainly to display tutorials when I am working in Photoshop elements -Am reading one Zane Grey novel so that is nice.  For me it would be better with a larger screen and no color would be OK, but this one gets the job done."
I am very pleased with the tablet.  It is taking a little while to get used to but I am learning.
Really like the new Fire HD 7.  Appreciate it that unlike my former Fire which this replaced I can now organize books into categories.  Some learning curve on it but so far I think its great.
Remarkable! This is my first purchase of this type so there's nothing to compare it to but I'm very happy.
AWSOME!
My 8 year old is loving her new kindle
The on/off button is located in an inconvenient spot.  It conflicts with the straps on any cover you buy.  Not obvious which way is the top if the device.
"I love my Kindle Fire.  I can now read ebook any where in or outside my home.  I may surf the web, check email, watch movies, videos, and listen to music from anywhere.  It is the greatest thing!"
"This is my third Kindle.  I have loved all of them, BUT this one only got 4 stars because in order to have 4HG it would have cost me over $100 more for basically the same model.  Maybe I'm getting more frugal as I age."
Great product.
Bought 2 for our sons. They are enjoying them very much. No problems so far.
"I've enjoyed my Kindle Fire HD 7.  Amazon has plenty of apps to choose from, though not all I was expecting, having used the Google Play store.  The device itself is clean, user friendly and fairly bug free.  I'm still scratching the surface of what this device can accomplish.  Great investment for the price."
love it
This is my second kindle I purchased this one with 16  GB and that it has the ability to take pictures so far so good still trying to understand the whole thing. Great for reading books from Amazon. I also purchased the case for it and it fits perfect Magenta Kindle and pink case easy to spot where ever I leave it. Oh I gave my first one to my Niece and she loves it.
"very disapointed, this is my 4th kindle and i expected it to be great like the other ones, it is not!  this unit WILL NOT  connect to wifi so i can't download any of the books that i've bought,watch tv, browse the internet or check email can't do anything!!"
"This is my third Kindle...VERY satisfied with them!  This one was so easy to set up and I love the new camera feature (that my old ones did not have).  It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  THANKS, Amazon, for the great service!"
"So far, my daughter loves her Kindle."
the only problem is the charging port is not strong enough for teens to use it.
It was everything I expected and more.
I had a kindle and it is the only tablet w wanted to replace it. I love it.
Awsome
I purchased  it for my grandsons and they loved them .
Bought two for our fire tablets. One fit one didn't.
"We have had the Amazon fire HD 7 For about a week now these are a few things that I've noticed. We are all Amazon fire phone users in our house and so we expected the tablet to be very similar. We have found that some things are similar but most things aren't. We also own an Apple iPad and a Microsoft surface in our household and use them all daily. So we are quite familiar with tablets. Up to this point I have found that the Amazon fire HD 7 is not good at being itself or in copying any other device. So far in the week that we have had it has seized up several times and had to be restarted one time. Those of us to use the Amazon fire phone are familiar with the feature where you sweep up to close the page or to push the home button twice to show all the apps that are running and individually close them. Neither one of these features are available on the Amazon fire HD 7 tablet. So far my opinion is that it is nonintuitive, unstable, and unreliable. I hope after sometime my opinion improves as software updates improve and I can post a favorable rating on this device."
I have to charge this thing all the time! The technician says every 8 hours and even in sleep mode it uses power. So what's the point of sleep mode! Then he turns around and says that sleep mode conserves power. So which is it? Should've got an IPad and dumped Amazon altogether!
Love it.  Picture quality is good.  Easy to use.  Sound is good.  Great quality for the price!
I love my kindle!
I love my fire HD.
Love it!! Great price and it was delivered fast!! it makes reading easier and plus you can surf the web and play games...so much more...I haven't even tried the camera or video yet!!! but storage is so not a problem on this 1!!!
Love this
"I received this 4th gen Kindle Fire HD nine days ago, and it's looking more and more like I threw away $100. I had an RCA 7&#34; tablet I purchased at Walmart's Black Friday sale last November. Unfortunately, I dropped it and ruined it, but I really wish it were still working. That $30 tablet was much more user friendly than this Fire is, and the graphics, while not as good, were good enough. This Kindle fire irritates me to no end Folks. For one thing, there's so much preinstalled on it when you turn it on that a good portion of your 8GB's of memory is unavailable. The memory you're left with will let you install a handful of games and one movie. If you want pics and tunes on your Fire I suppose you'd need to be connected to the Internet 100% of the time, which I am not, and I'm not paying AT&T another $100/mo so I have 24/7 access to content stored on the Cloud. You can't add memory to this device. You're stuck with the 8GB's, and it's insufficient. Let me add: I have two Kindles--a Keyboard and a Paperwhite, which work perfectly well, so I didn't purchase the Fire strictly as an eReader. However, I am an avid reader, and it seemed that this Fire was a device which could do it all--store my eBooks, games, pics, etc., and even let me watch movies thanks to my Prime membership. WRONG. I did watch one movie, but since then I haven't been able to download another, even after I removed the first movie. On my laptop Amazon tells me I'm downloading the movie, but when I go to watch it on the Fire I'm told that I can't watch the movie because I don't have an Internet connection. Frustrating. Also, Amazon slams you with ads on this device. I've played Hungry Shark Evolution on my Samsung phone and on the RCA tablet, and I never had to deal with all these ads almost every time I lose a life. When I'm playing games I often don't have an Internet connection, so Amazon is apparently using a hefty chunk of my little 8 gigs of storage to store all those ads instead of letting meuse it for what I want to store. Also, when I play Hungry Shark Amazon's menu bar keeps popping up on the right side of my screen, causing me to hit it inadvertently, which takes me back to the startup screen and closes my game AND makes me lose my progress. Unless I'm mistaken, there's no way to turn it off temporarily or reposition it. Oh, and when I read the description on Amazon it led me to believe I'd be able to get games from Google Play, but you can ONLY get games from Amazon, and believe me: The games and apps at Amazon are nowhere near as good or plentiful as the games and apps at Google Play. So, I'm kicking myself for not spending a little bit more for a Samsung tablet, which I know would have made me happy. My advice to you is: DON'T BUY THE KINDLE FIRE HD 7 7&#34; 4TH GEN. I don't think it's worth $50, but I KNOW it's not worth $100."
"Good Tablet, Great resolution.  Has watch ESPN"
"Love the Fire, best money I have spent for years"
"I use it daily, great all around tablet."
Much better than the older Kindle Fire.
It was all that I expected. Has a nice size screen and has lots of free apps. Love it.
"Fire HD 7, is Great..."
Viewing videos often involves the movie stopping to catch up downloading before continuing.
I am blown away by the level of crisp clear graphics and fluidity of this device. I've been a die hard Barnes and noble consumer of their readers but now I can honestly say I am a changed woman.
Love it.  Perfect
I had old Kindel . This why I ordered another one. It is easy to as my original.
I m used to the apple devices and now a bit lost w this new toy. It really sucks that it linked to my Amazon account and can enable anyone make purchases without additional warning or password. My kids were buying books n stuff on kindle while they were reading on the device.
"I had a first generation fire and loved it. I randomly would shut down and I couldn't get it to reboot. It finally died so I decided to get the latest fire hd. The battery life is horrible. Some reading and a few games and it's down to 10% in less than 2 hours. Maybe I have a defective one. Other then that I love it. The HD is very noticeable, glare is worse but I won't get a protective cover for fear of losing some of the HD"
"I received the original Kindle Fire a few years ago for Mothers Day and loved it.  I just got my new 7&#34; Fire HD and love it even more.<br />I just don't like the connection for charging - it's way too tight and difficult to access with the RooCase cover on it despite the fact it said it was made specially for this exact unit.  Same is true for the on/off switch - it slips under an edge of the cover and I cannot acceess it.  Otherwise, it's amazing"
It does not hold a charge and freezes
"We love our new Kindle Fire HD 7. The graphics are great, the books are easier to read."
Very disappointed.  The battery life is too short.
"If all you plan on doing is browsing the internet, checking email, and playing games, don't waste your money on &#34;fancier&#34; tablets. This is all you need. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because I wish the camera was better quality. My &#34;dumb phone&#34; cellphone has a better camera."
"Gooday mates,  when i first got this Fire HD 7 Kindle i was very happy with it, but the folks at Amazon won't leave well enough alone, they are constantly &#34;update'n&#34; this HD 7 Kindle, i let it go these last 3 times (i believe it is) but this latest &#34;update&#34; really has me to where i'm consider'n on given them the HD 7 Kindle back.<br />I purchased the tablet because i'm someone who reads all the time, i had no problem read'n me books up until this latest &#34;update&#34; now when i'm read'n one of me books the screen will just go black for no apparent reason, sometimes i'm hold'n the kindle and sometimes i'm not, so i don't understand what is make'n the screen go black, every time it dose that i have to back out to me home page, then reopen the book back to the page i was on before the screen went black.<br />I don't know if Amazon is do'n this on purpose hope'n i will get upset enough to maybe buy the latest Kindle Fire, or it's just some kind of fluke due to the latest update, either way if it dosen't stop in a very short amount of time i'm go'n to pack up this HD 7 Kindle and give it back to them, i'll go back to read'n paperback books, none of the pages will go blank for no apparent reason.<br />Two years ago i gave this HD 7 Kindle 5 star's, today i'm so discussed with it i'm only go'n to give it 2 star's."
"I  received it as a gift so I had no expectations. However, I certainly don't like all of the ads that pop up between screens. I am thinking if you pay that much money for a device, you should not have to deal with that. With some games you are able to pay a few dollars so you don't get ads but other games that is not an option. If you are debating between the Kindle and an iPad, the additional dollars might be a good choice."
I like how much more I can do than with my Kindle.  I am learning a lot still but I am very happy.  My son gave me an Amazon gift card for Mother's day and I used that to help purchase this item.  I also got a $5 coupon from Amazon so the price was great.
Just what hubby needed. Now I can use mine more
It's great just wished it had more apps
Very good transaction. Great quality pictures and videos. Excellent sound. Glad to have this device.
I really enjoy this Kindle Fire tablet.
Easy set up.
My sons gave the Fire to me for mothers day.  It is awesome.  Even my husband likes it.
I bought this for my toddler son so that he could have the ABC Mouse learning app. He absolutely loves his kindle and understood how to completely work it after one day. The free time app gives me peace of mind that he isn't surfing the internet or viewing anything inappropriate. It also ensures he doesn't make purchases in the apps. The only downfall is that it needs to be charged after about 3 hours of use on a full charge. This was a great buy and I'm so glad we went with a Kindle and not the IPad!!!
Great! It's helping my son with his reading!
Very pleased with the Fire HD.  I almost bought a 6&#34; instead of the 7&#34;.  Glad I got the 7&#34;.
Battery doesn't last very long.. not really thrilled with it..but was a gift so will use once in a while..but like my original Kindle better as<br />can read forever without the battery going down...
My third!
"So far, I love it but need a whole lot more time to find out what I have bought into!"
Very happy with the product
"It's really great.  Will take some time before I learn all of the things that I can do with the fire, but I love it..."
So cute and lightweight I love it
"I receiveded all my items I had on my previous kindle but lost all my scores for the games.  It made me go back to the beginning and start over.  The kindle has a camera but no instructions were sent with it.  I don,t know how to work the camera.  Please help with some instructions."
"Was a gift that went over  ++ well.  After two other brands that were more trouble than they were worth, Father's Day gift was a  real winner in using it.  Having the Help built in, is great feature."
I am enjoying the tablet. If someone knows the correct micro hdmi connection for tv hookup please let me know. So far I've picked wrong twice. Thanks.
"While the video and audio quality is much better than earlier versions, I'm still not a fan of everything I open staying on my Carousel.  That's what 'My Favorites' is for!!  Also, the camera is not very good."
Amazon has shifty business ethics. Tried charging me $15 to remove the promo ads. Sleezy and greasy. I am thinking lawsuit (class action) for deceptive business practice. Not sure it is possible for them to go any lower. Taking my business somewhere else.
does it all
"Not used to yet, so many features."
Love it!
I'm addicted to this thing
I absolutely LOVE my Kindle Fire! I've been wanting one for awhile but didn't want to spend too much money since it would be mostly used for me to read on and I spend enough on books so the Kindle Fire 7 was perfect for me. My son also loves it and it's easy for him to use and I can actually get him to read a lot more rather than play games all the time. Perfect buy I'd recommend it to everyone!
I love it
"So far very impressed. Easy to use for a guy that usually has to get one of my grandkids to show me how to use the newer technology. Good price, great value and will do everything that I need.  Bob"
ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY NEW KENDALL
"I really enjoy my kindle. It,s such fun.Still learning how to work it."
"I was very surprised at how quick the shipping was and the product is very nice.  I am having some trouble getting use to the set up and not being able to have the &#34;creature&#34; comforts that I have on my tablet (i.e., wallpaper, smaller icons (not the carousel) etc.  I am happy with the selection of books offered, but sometimes feel that I am limited because I want to purchase the book, but it is not as economical as I had hoped.  I also wanted to get something to protect my new Fire, but I just wanted something similar to an Otterbox and had no luck finding that.  Overall, Im pleased, but I was hoping to be much more ecstatic about it."
Love my new Fire HD with the rear camera!
So very happy with my fire hd 7.<br />A real pleasure to use.
Receive my tablet it started shutting off by itself now the last time it shut off n will not come back on so I will be sending it back to try another one and if doesn't work I will be getting a refund
Works great! No problems at all!
"Amazing. Tried a different tablet first. After 6 days of frustration, returned it and got the Fire HD 7. Turned on, loaded, up and running in literally 10 minutes. So glad I went back to Kindle. Lesson learned!"
"I would have given this 5 stars was it not for the inordinate amount of effort I spent trying to get the device unlinked from my email address after I purchased it as a gift for my Dad. Other than that, it is great and he loves it even though he knows very little about modern technology. A great gift for anyone."
"Perfect tool for the job. Needed a device that would play video for our little one while in the car. Roads trips are much easier now! Plus, capabilities for future interactions for toddlers and adults. AWESOME!"
I just love it it's faster
"I purchased this with an Otterbox for my daughter.  My son has an IPad Mini.  I am usually an android person but I have paid for the same games for both devices so they wouldn't fight over which tablet to play with.  The Kindle requires a WiFi connection for most games to work.  For example, I purchased SpongeBob Moves In on both devices.  The IPad Mini is able to play the game without internet while the Kindle cannot.  Furthermore, the device recently froze up.  I called Customer Service and did the hard reboot as suggested.  Nothing works.  It comes on and goes to the &#34;Kindle Fire&#34; screen and that's it.  Customer Service states that it is the battery but they do not service these devices and since my Kindle is 4 months past my 1 year warranty, they could only offer a discount for a new Kindle.  I went online and purchased a new battery and had my husband change it out.  It still does the same thing.  In conclusion, if you want to purchase a product that lasts about a year then this product is cool but be sure to buy the extra warranty.  Personally, I won't be purchasing another Kindle product.  This was my second Kindle.  Amazon doesn't stand behind their products in my opinion.  If you do some research online, I'm not the only one that has had these same issues."
Looking for a tablet and at the price and quality the Fire can't be beat!
Very good for the price point.
"I am very happy with my new HD 7 it is everything I expected. Fantastic quick shipping, 1 day wow."
Great tablet.  Does everything I need it to and more. I do wish the camera was a little better thought.
I have the kindle fire 7&#34; hd that i bought 2 years ago and i love it so i got one for my granddaughter she loves it.
Awesome fire!! Much better than the one I got three years ago!!
"Very frustrated :( I received my brand new kindle fire 7 out of the box and it doesn't connect to wi-fi which makes it totally unusable. After doing everything in all the forums to try to fix the problem (mind you the internet works on my laptop, ipad, old fashioned kindle paper, and all other devices) the device does not connect to wi-fi. It says the device was &#34;updated&#34; last in 2014. Why does the device not come updated?! I manually updated the device using my computer to drag and drop the update onto the kindle and now it just continues to endlessly say &#34;authenticating&#34; and &#34;connecting...&#34; eventually it says DHCP error and I'm only left with hard restarting my kindle, restarting my modem and router, hard restarting my kindle again, changing it back to factory settings, changing the time zone, changing websettings to have a static IP address (which says it works but will not let me log in on the amazon page) After hours of painstakingly combing through help forums I thought Amazon support might help me but after spending 50 minutes on the phone with someone with a thick accent who was reading off of a script they were not help at all! They just clicked the refund button for me and I could have done that myself without the long wait time and infuriating support staff.  If you have to speak with support staff I highly recommend using chat instead of phone."
The Kindle Fire is just what I hoped for. Crisp visuals. Easy to read. I love it.
Works perfectly easy set up a pleasure to use .highly recommend.
Having another HD7 to replace my lost tablet feels like i never lost a step.
I have a kindle and bought this second one for my husband.  They are great fun.
Excellent.
No native Google Play Store support (proprietary Android OS version). Otherwise okay. Returning and getting an Android 5.0 compatible tab.
Good product but no battery life ... Died without being used for 2 days when it was fully charged
"Not what I wanted. I wanted a computer first came on like computer, than what it did I don't know.<br />Wouldn't send me a returning label. Or call me, and email me about this. Just took the last of my money out of my account more than once for it.<br />I shipped it back to you just please give me my money back.<br />I told you I couldn't afford it was a poor person. But took advance of me.  I need that money please return it. I won't ever bother you again.<br /> Thank you Rhonda"
"This was an unexpected gift & I love it.  Still getting to know the ins and outs, but I've been using it for numerous things.  It's a great addition to my original Kindle which is still going strong after daily use for the past 5 years."
"Its working pretty good, my only comment that is bad is that it seems to run a little slow."
This is my second Kindle. The quality is very good for the price.
"Bought the Kindle for my 8 year old, he is using it all the time"
Again it was not here when i got home i put in a dispute for the charge
I absolutely love my kindle fire. Best reader by far.
Very happy
love it!  just not familiar with how to add apps into it and other functionalities
This was a replacement unit.  I knew exactly what I was getting
Great size for reading!
The charging port on my first Fire HD 7 broke so I replaced it with anew one. Love it. I like having 16 GB rather than my originals 8.
Love it ! Works Great !
"I must preface this review with a note that I previously had a kindle fire 2. It has ridiculously awesome battery life but it was finally time for a new tablet since I lost mine in an airport.<br /><br />A good tablet but seriously lacking. The battery life is abysmal. It's supposed to have 10 hours of battery life but in the 2 weeks I've had the fire, it will lose 30% in just an hour. I charged it and left it unplugged overnight and lost 60% battery before waking up the next day. I have it set to all the available power saving features.  The cameras for a 2014 device are just terrible. The front camera is so bad it's a joke. My galaxy s4 from 2013 has much better quality on both cameras. There is no flash on the back camera so you better hope you have great lighting for pictures and don't need a flashlight when holding the fire. It's very disappointing the wireless card does not use the faster 5 Ghz speeds from modern routers. If you have a fast wireless N or AC router, you will not be getting the speeds you should. This is a modified android device and I find it insulting you can't use the Google Play store to download all of the very same apps you've already paid for that are available on Amazon's store. The amount of apps approved for use on the Amazon store is also insulting. Their music and video choices are amongst the best in the industry but their app store is laughable. You can't even use Instagram, a major social media app!<br /><br />I must note that I signed up to develop on the Fire OS 5.0 which is also a modified version of Google's Android lollipop. Whatever is going  on in this version of the OS for battery should also be on all current versions of the fire. The battery life has improved so much it's ridiculous. You can leave it alone for 2 days and still expect about 70% battery to be available. Also, this version while probably not the final version, looks exactly like EVERY Android tablet with lollipop 5+ in existence. So, if they are going to keep this skin it should also support Google apps and the play store."
beyond my expectations
Enjoying it
"Loving it, and the ease it has with integration of other Amazon products.  And I'm an apple owner and fan.  But doesn't wow me enough to replace my IPAD yet."
I had the 2nd version.  It was disappointing not to be able to read without a light.  This was the main reason I was interested in the new Fire HD 7.But upon receiving it as quickly as I did.  Then seeing the color pigment and the options available.  I am extremely happy with the choice.  If asked I definitely will recommend it to friends.
I enjoy my kindle every time I pic it up hardly ever use the lap top any more.
Everything I expected and then some!
Ordered Saturday got it on Monday. Can't complain about nothing. Love the product and the service.
Love my new Kindle Fire!  I got it for my birthday and am enjoying using it.  I used it on the beach and it worked wonderfully.
"The battery lasts maybe 2 hours, pretty useless unless your on wifi and using free time for kids. Takes 4 hours to fully charge."
Bought this for my granddaughter. Her brother got one for xmas and they both work flawlessly.
always a huge kindle fan~
"While shopping in store for an upgrade from a Kindle Fire, I found the availability scarce.  I settled for what was in stock and am satisfied, but must do a lengthy transfer of past purchases (books, music, etc) from cloud to new device.  I would also prefer a choice if I want those transfers on the carousel or to remain on the prospective lists (books, music, etc)."
"I was looking for an ereader and I did some research and ended up going with the Fire HD. I am extremely happy with my choice. Only downside I have is the books are cheaper through Barnes and Noble, but the tablet itself is amazing!"
App selection is limited.
"Lightweight and easy to read. So far it has great battery life, even playing games. This is my 3rd kind of kindle and I love the fire!"
My son wanted this as his as his present for getting good grades this year. He loves it! I love the options to limit the screen time and parent protect app purchases. I think it's a great investment for kids entertainment as well as for education.
works great
Found easy to load books and red. I have a app on i Pad-hd for Kindle. Even battery goes low switching between platforms Kindle remembers the last page read on both
I LOVE my new kindle; makes it so easy to read & take with you on the run!
awesome tablet...
Love it!!
I had to return my first one after 3 days do to the fact it would not turn on or take a charge. On my 2nd one now.
"Arrived perfectly - but it was more than my 2.6Mbps Verizon DSL WiFi could deal with, locking onto open, nearby signals, not mine. It became an unfortunate necessity to return the item. Return promptly refunded. Damn Verizon DSL!"
I was disappointed every thing from &#34;Patsy 3&#34; did not transfer to the new one. My books did and that was most important. I call and did not get the usual good service.  I couldn't understand her.
"This is my second Kindle, and performs better than my first. I like the voice to text feature and all the improvements I keep discovering along the way. My adding additional memory makes it more useful than my first. I like it so much that it's difficult to put down, it's too exciting and I<br />think of it as an extension to my laptop."
"I liked the original Kindle fire a lot better. The Fire HD 7 doesn't allow you a lot of app that the previous Fire did, when using google play. I purchased two of these and had I'd know about the lack of apps I wouldn't have bought them."
"I had a Kindle Paperwhite and I decided to buy a Kindle Fire to use as my reading device. This is definitely far superior to any e-ink reading device IMO. I read a lot and for my books that have pictures, diagrams or any oddly formatted text, e-ink is just useless. I also copy a lot of PDF documents (which have color, tables, etc) and read them on my device as well. Tried that on the Kindle Paperwhite. That was painful. They look great on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Here's a battery tip for people like me who use this just as a reading device: turn on airplane mode. Only use WiFi when downloading books and other content, and then turn on airplane mode. The battery lasts a LOT longer with no internet. It can go days without charging."
Awesome!!
"Upgraded from Kindle paper white to the fire( my 4th since the day they were offered @ a promo on Oprah)This inexpensive Tablet is so much more than a reader. I have yet to use all it has to offer. You can watch movies, shop on Amazon & so much more all in very vivid color. I absolutely love this device."
"Product is as described, but there is a learning curve that takes time to conquer.  Certain aspects of how to use and modify the unit for use are not so clearcut or intuitive.  Like &#34;bookmarks&#34;.  Not easily imported from any other system and organizing them is a PIA.  But, for something to browse the internet and play some games, it works.  On the subject of games, there are some I have on my iPhone that are not available on the Fire."
"I love my kindle. The picture is sharp, my games don't lag, and the quality is amazing."
Bought for my Dad to have an electronic way to view the Bible. No monthly service fee required. He likes it and the sleekness of it.
"Son loves it. FreeTime could be a little more robust, maybe providing a &#34;request access to...&#34; feature for getting apps/content that aren't approved by default. My son can't even browse the app store without it. However, the hardware is great and the unit is solid. Great screen and performance. Will be buying another for my daughter for Christmas."
"I am very pleased with the Kindle Fire.  It is very easy to navigate through pages, the graphics are excellent, and am very happy with the screen size.  The Kindle Fire is proving to be very convenient as I have a desktop computer and obviously cannot take it room to room.  Would highly recommend this Kindle and also the Kindle e-reader.  I am very happy with these products."
"I am not particularly happy with my new Kindle Fire HD because I had to buy it to replace my first Kindle that would no longer recharge.  What does an &#34;unchargeable&#34; Kindle have to do with a newer Fire HD, you may ask?  I could see no reason why a well-kept Kindle would just die like that; I received no trade-in (am I living on Fantasy Island to expect merchandise  to last longer than it does??); and I feel that the Fire HD is more difficult to navigate.  That being said, I am definitely no big fan of technology and tread lightly and slowly when faced with technology that often takes me a great deal of time to learn and use efficiently.  I guess I'm just an &#34;old fogey&#34; but I am disgruntled that I was forced into this unexpected and unwelcome purchase in order to be able to read what had already been purchased and was in my queue on my first Kindle.  Just for the record, it doesn't have a greater battery life and doesn't recharge any faster than my old Kindle."
loving it
Luv it....
Love it and the price was great also!!!
"I Love my new Fire Kindle.  I had the old one and this one is so much better, I especially like the fact that I can take pictures."
"Great so far! I have nothing to compare it too, but I will say we are very impressed with the audio."
I love this Kindle Fire!!!
I can't live without my kindle not to say it's perfect but I always have it close by...works well for me!
Commercials.poor explanations on new features. Sorry my old one broke and sorry I bought this one.
"This is my second kindle fire, purchased as a replacement since I loved my first one till it was dropped. not happy with this device at all. Battery won't even last a day. My other kindle did not have this problem."
My husband and I both have our first kindle and we love it !!
"I was very disappointed I still can't watch days of our lives on this device.  It is the only reason I got a new one.  Also I couldn't find out a lot about what it did before I bought it.  The shipping charge was horrible, but I had to get it in time for someone to help me with it so I had no recourse."
I've had my tablet for a week and so far I love it. It was easy to get started. I am going to take it with me when I go to Europe. I would recommend this product.
too many popup advertizing
"The Amazon fire is awesome... didn't think I ever wanted something like it...but it is very cool.  You can watch Netflix movies in bed before you go to sleep.  Downloading new books is awesome. It will read the books to you while you are driving.  You can listen to music on it...I'm not that much into new technology stuff, but this thing is awesome for the price."
I love it
It is great
"Hard to start a new book,might be owner operator! Have to touch 4or5 times to open new book."
Love my new kindle. Bought it with extra space and am glad I did - recommend the extra cost. You will need the extra space before you know it.
Fantastic
"This is the best tablet by far. After my son going through 3 different tablets, this one by far is the most durable and reliable one yet!!"
"The plastic feel makes it look poorly (and cheaply) made. The good part, is that it won't break very easily after a few drops. Besides that, you won't be able to get a quality android tablet, unlike this for under $100 dollars. Keep in mind, that the app-store does not have so many quality applications, so that is a huge downside."
"I love it.  I am 83yrs old and find the directions very easy to follow.  Sorry I didn't get sooner.  Thanks for a great product.<br />,"
This is my 1st fire and I'm still learning to use it. So far so good.
"Well worthy for the price !! Very sleek, very clear screen , perfectly  for video browsing and this 7&#34; makes it not to big nor too small to hold it during watching!"
great product
Colors are vibrant and the size is perfect very user friendly I love it
"I love it, we have 3 kindles now"
"2nd Kindle Fire I have had, love it."
Got it for the wife & she is happy with it.
A OK!
"We bought this tablet primarily for streaming video and e-mailing. For these purposes, the size is just right. I did, however purchase the Bluetooth keyboard to make e-mailing more convenient."
I love it
"I loved my first generation Fire (which died mostly due to wear and tear from being in the household of two small children).  This version is every bit as good as the original.  I decided not to opt-out of the advertisements, and they have not really been that much of a bother.  As a device, I have always been extremely impressed overall with the Fire.  From the first generation, I have always found the Kindle to be an excellent combination of reader and tablet.  I find the cost/benefit of the Fire to be exceptional.  You get a great device for an incredible price.  We might add another one to our household."
So far very good still trying to figure it out
Bought this for my parents. They are enjoying it and it's very user friendly.
"I'm a librarian and I love books. I've read some on my iPad and it is just a little heavy and I didn't really like the app. I was really blaming not liking it on the fact that I didn't like eBooks, but the Kindle totally changed my mind.<br /><br />Books are books and I'm totally Team Read. It doesn't matter what you are using to read, just spend time reading!I love the Kindle, I love physical books, I love it all.<br /><br />Kindle Fire Pros: lightweight, easy to read on (no eye strain for me), easy to use lots of different eBook lending services through my local library, easy to buy books on from Amazon<br /><br />Kindle Fire Cons: battery dies quicker than I thought it would, battery is slow to charge (my iPad charges faster)."
"My previous tablet left me so frustrated. The Fire HD 7 is HOT, HOT, HOT.  I love it. It was so easy to get started, and downloads were fast and I was playing games and posting on FB so quickly.  A quality product."
Great product. Create features so it is kid ready and not on parent's account.
Awe love our kindle!!!
"This is my first tablet, but i brought my 7 year old the 6&#34; and could manage it ok so i brought me one. I mainly use it for reading, but also got it when i want to use youtube, and play some games that i do not want on my phone. I like its ease of use and features."
Excellent product.
"Very easy to operate, love everything about it."
So much clearer and faster than my old Fire.  Love it!
Love to read my Kindle.  This is my second one.
Excellent!!!!!
This is my third Kindle.  I use them all and love them!
"I had a Kindle Fire for 3 plus years. It still works, just needs reset every day. I got this one a week ago and so far so good. It is so handy to just grab it up and take it with me."
AWESOME!
This is  my 6th kindle (I think). I have been very impressed with all of them.
"Love it!  I owned a Digital 2 prier to purchasing the Fire.  The touch screen is much nicer and a better quality.  The Fire also responds faster and has more memory.  Perfect for games, e-mail, even browsing the web.  For the price I am completely impressed with the Fire tablet.  Would recommend to friends and family members."
"Love this for my 3 year-old. Great parental controls & access to learning games, & every kid's favorite, Minecraft. Thank goodness for the protection plan. Already used it for a smashed screen after 4 months. Knew that was going to come in handy!"
"It's my first tablet and it is easy to use, sharp display, wonderful sound, easily transportable - perfect for my use."
I am thoroughly enjoying the Kindle Fire HD 7.
"Amazon's service in this matter of replacing my Fire 7 HD for warranty issues was lighting fast . I talked to the rep on Friday night and on Sunday , a new one was delivered . Well Done ."
GREAT
"I am still learning how to find my way around, but so far a real delight."
"This tablet is amazing it has great sound, picture and it's very fast. The only problem I had was the camera. It's simply awful. The picture is horrible, it's fuzzy and washed out, on both the front and back. If your looking for something with a nice picture go look elsewhere."
Love my Fire HD!! Wish I had more time to spend on it!
"Awesome clarity, easy to use... Much bigger than I thought it would be. I really, really like it!"
got my delivery in 2 days it's exactly what I needed no surprises
Nice looking works very well.
"Honestly, the actual product is REALLY nice. Super sleek, feels great, lightweight, awesome display, etc. And it was $99 bucks when i got it...<br /><br />I returned it after about ten minutes of unboxing though. The reason I bought it was to play Clash of Clans on it. I quickly found out that Amazon store doesn't have Clash of Clans. They must have one of those stupid deals with Game of War where you can only download that game but not any competitors... lame.<br /><br />If you aren't trying to play Clash of Clans and can deal with the limited amount of apps in the Amazon store vs. Google Play store, this is a great product. I am sure there are tons of apps you can download from the Amazon store, but literally the only one i wanted, they don't have.<br /><br />I should have done my research :)"
"I've had it less than a week. It froze several times and now it doesn't work at all. It won't charge  or turn on. Nothing. I'm sending it back to get my money back. Not only that, but the otter box case that was recommended for it was for a different kindle. Total waste of money on both products."
The owners manual could be more inclusive - otherwise I really am pleased with my Fire.
I'm complety satisfied with my purchase
"This is my 2nd Fire, love it!!"
I love my kindle!
Love it. I would buy it again.
great for on the move
"What is there not to love about the Kindle?! As someone who reads a lot having the bigger 7&#34; screen option is easy on the eyes, which I love. It's also great for game play and to watch an occasional movie. I do a lot of travel for work, and having this Kindle nearby makes the commute time go by so much faster! The display on the screen is nice and clear, and I can do a lot of my work on the Kindle since it can open PDF files and emails.<br /><br />I received this item free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
"Like it a lot.  It is a little heavier than I expected and I am really still learning to use the settings, but I am happy I bought it."
"I was always hesitant about buying the kindle fire because I thought it would be a waste of money.....BUT I WAS WRONG! I absolutely love love love it! There are separate profiles to keep my little boys content separate from mine, i just love it!"
Love it easy to use. Nice size does e everything my computer does
Yes everything I was looking for
I love it. My 2 year old kindle fire stopped holding a charge and this is a welcome upgrade!
Love it!
I love my Kindle Fire 7 it's great I can read my email also of course read my book go online and find information. It's just GREAT no problems at all.
"Ok device, failed within 2 months and now is going to take 2 months to get a replacement.  Like the fire well enough but Amazon's failing to have timely fulfillment of a replacement due to a serious backorder situation when necessary is would make me seriously rethink purchasing this tablet again."
The Kindle HD7 is so user friendly and dependable. You can't lose with this tablet.
"its wonderful, crisp and clean display, perfect size and speedy. I really only use it for reading manga (because Amazon has a huge selection) so I can't comment on the other functions but still it's a great tablet for the price."
Very 'PLEASED&#34;
"I absolutely love it!  This is my 3rd Kindle, my 2nd being the Kindle Fire.  The HD version is even better!!  I'll forever be a Kindle user :)"
Birthday present. Wife loves it....
"I love it. I don't need a smart phone, so the tablet does everything else, but bother me when I don't want to be bothered.  LOL<br /><br />Great!"
Like but just have to get use to differences.
Love it!
"I love my new &#34;Fire 7&#34; and find I am using it as a laptop as well as a Kindle Reader.  It's fast and efficient, and very user friendly."
Cannot stream live tv from my cable supplier.(must disable usb debugging)from developer options.
Bought as a gift for a 12 year old.  It was a hit!!
Love it!!!!
Love it
My son loves his Kindle.
"Product is excellent.  Print is a little small when trying to read instructions.  I may just not have discovered how to enlarge font.  It does allow me to enlarge once I open documents, e-mail, etc.  I am still learning how to use it."
Very good  deal.
"It was for my wife, so I don't know much about."
"Great item for the price; easy to navigate and very sharp graphics.  The battery needs charging more frequently than I expected based on usage, but not a major problem."
Great tablet . So far it works good.
LOVE IT!!!!!!
Love it
"I really love my Fire HD 7! As my entry into the tablet game, I am thoroughly pleased with my choice (I thought about buying the HD 6) and purchase.  The size is perfect for my needs, as it does everything I need and flits neatly in my purse."
I previously had the 1st generation Kindle Fire. I loved my 1st gen fire but it had no Bluetooth and I just got Bluetooth headphones. So of course it was time for an upgrade. I like that I now have Bluetooth that is very easy to connect. Bigger screen is always a plus. Easy to use a few things took some getting use to like and actually volume button on the side.<br />One of the things I don't like is that this Kindle Fire is harder for me to turn off and on. For some reason I have to hold the button longer or press harder. I'm sure I will get use to it and for all the upgrades compared to the 1st generation it is worth it. I don't use the camera much so I couldn't tell you the quality of that but I have no problem switching from one app to another or playing music. Speakers are great and no problems watching movies or TV shows.
"It was listed as &#34;with special offers&#34; but I'm not sure what those are? Nothing on my Kindle I'd consider to be above and beyond what it would normally come with.<br />Still getting used to the layout but so far it has been a great purchase! I transferred a few movies onto it using OneDrive and they play perfectly, and also transferred books onto it using the &#34;send to Kindle&#34; email."
Absolutely love the Kindle....I have about 6-7 on my account because I gave to my grandchildren as presents!
Love the new front and rear facing cameras and the eye-catching color!  Goes great with my Fire Stick which is also awesome; great buy!!!!
"Excellent, easy to use"
Happy customer
"This Fire HD is a replacement for one that was stolen in France last week. Love the tablet. However, I was charged for shipping when ad said free shipping, can't get Amazon to do anything about it."
Love it
"Returned it, didn't like size and feel"
It does everything I want.  Very happy
I love the HD screen and I find it to be useful but I should have gotten the larger 16G Memory capacity.  You will be surprised how quickly you can max out the 8G Memory.  But for the $99 price I can't complain.
"This was my second Kindle Fire,  1ST HD version.  I received the Kindle on a Tuesday,  and by Saturday it was no longer working.  It would simply not turn on.  I contacted customer service,  spoke with I presume the Kindle tech support rep;  dead! !<br />My frustration is Amazon wanted me too wait until the end of July to obtain a replacement. It is now June 20th.<br /><br />I love to read and I am disappointed with both Kindle Fire purchases.<br /><br />I wonder if I should try the paperwhite version?"
Audio and video are great
Haven't had much time to work it yet. I'm sure I will like it because I love my other Kindel.
i enjoy it
"I have had kindles for the past few years.  I have even given them as gifts.  This particular kindle went to my Father for Father's day.  Now my father is basically computer illeterate.  After a couple of minutes of instruction he was using it to play the games that I knew he would like.  I am confident that as he gets more comfortable with it, the more he will access the other options available on it."
This is my sixth kindle. Love them all. Each new one a little upgrade
"The real downside of this device is the lack of a memory card slot, which makes it very limited, you can hardly add any programs to the device itself. For that reason, buy a model up to get the memory card slot, at 50% more cost. Another option is the HP Stream 7&#34; device which runs Windows 8.1, so is a ;little chunkier in the OS and has a limited app marketplace, but at $80 with Office 365 included, a much better deal if your going cheap."
awesome with a side of awesome sauce
A very good product
Great product I'm very happy with my purchase.
Very pleased with all that the Fire can do.
as expected...Awesome!
Really good bought these for all 47 of my children hoping. They would be really good for them except until the day the poltergeist came out of the screen kidnapping all 47 of my kids i havent seen any of them in 4 months otherwise great buy at a great price :) definetley reccomend
"I love my Fire HD 7 Kindle, so many things you can do with it. Should have gotten it a long time again.  thumbs up!!"
Love it!
Easy to set up and use. Recharges quickly. Love it!!!!!
Awesome!
"Lots of apps available, I lose time and need to recharge before I know how much time I have spent using it."
Very easy to use
Love it.
"I like it...But why am I losing so much battery power when it's turned off?... I'm Loosing about %5 power an hour, With my tablet turned Off. I'll charge it up to 100% and 2 hours later I'll turn it on and it's down to 90% battery. That's in sleep mode with wifi and bluetooth turned off."
"I was very dissapointed over limited instructions about how to use it, I had to Google how to use it. I don't find it user friendly, still cant figure out how to &#34;get out&#34; of any thing without powering it off. I don't like that the free kids games are stored &#34;in the cloud&#34; instead of on the device, so without internet, gra dlids can't play tge games. I dislike being forced to put a password on it, and that the sign in times out and I have to enter it again. Over all, I'm sorry I bought it and won't recommend it to others. I'm most likely to return it."
My grandson had broken two other Samsung Galaxy tabs I bought him previous. This I thought would be perfect for him. So far it has taken a few hard knocks and is still working perfectly. Great product!  Super for children.
Great
"I wanted a Kindle to take full advantage of my Amaazon Prime membership.  Particularly the availability of currently published books.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could obtain current music as well. Also, Amazon &#34;remembers&#34; every CD music purchase I've ever made since the last century.....and I can listen to it on the Kindle!  What a country, God Bless America!"
I like this product but not being able to connect it to my TV with an HDMI cable and adaptor was very disappointing.
Love my Fire HD just wish the battery lasted longer.
Worst product I have ever owned WiFi is difficult to connect with keeps being bumped off web Irishmen watching video on Facebook that come from certain sites like youtube the playback is either never loading or it stops and starts continually. Or just stops playing.
It's everything I thought it would be!
Really like the feel of this tablet and the ease of use.  Would recommend this to anyone.
Such a steal. Definitely can play just as well as the more expensive tablets. This is the second Fire I've owned...nothing bad to say.
"Performs well,  still getting used to the Kindle set up."
"More then what I expected. I wanted an up to date reader to replace my original kindle. I have yet to read any books on it yet, because I'm so distracted by all the apps I use on it!"
love love love my new Kindle Fire. Easy to use.
Love It!!!!! I have had 3 Kindles but this one is the best.  Easy set up. Ended up buying a keyboard to make it easier to answer emails.....I love it.
"Disappointed, I have an IPad which I love and use it all the time, but wanted something smaller and lighter for travel. It is smaller and lighter but so much more difficult to navigate. I guess you get what you pay for."
Fantastic but wish I could put a background on the homepage.
"This is an extremely disappointing device. Forgetting the problems with the ordering (first said it was available and then the confirmation said a month form now), the app store experience is horrible.  Coming from an iPad it is very disappointing, but also misleading.  they have games that have same names as on iTunes or googleplay, but they are not the same.  sometimes they are just puzzles or other rubbish.  i am a long time prime member and use a lot of amazon services.  this is truly awful."
"I bought these for my kids and they freeze up, battery dies after a few hours, and there really slow."
Awesome!  the new gen 4 Fire HD 7 is a huge improvement from my gen 2 device
"Having carried books with me all my life everywhere I went, the Fire is a perfect light replacement. Having loved libraries, its great to have one in my backpack. I really have not explored the other wonderful things it can do yet, I have been enthralled with having books at my fingertips. I think I'll explore the camera next."
Meet all my expectations !!
"We all went the most bang for our buck and if you keep in mind the low cost of this item, the features and capabilities are impressive. Paired with Amazon Prime, you can go wrong."
7&#34; is much easier to read than the 6&#34;.  Easy to use.
Great tablet with sharp HD disply.
Love it
"Got this for my daughter's birthday. She loves it. I would give it 5 stars if the parental controls were more customizable. She is too old for Kindle Free Time, as a teenager, she should have more control and shouldn't have to come to me to enter a password every time she wants to use it. She uses the calculator and calendar as well as several websites to do homework. She also enjoys watching YouTube videos of MineCraft and cooking how tos. I wish I could put a daily time limit internet access and games while still allowing access to books and educational sites and apps.  It would be great if there was a teenage version of FreeTime that allowed internet access with time limits and the ability to monitor activity or customize which websites are accessible while blocking access to inappropriate content.  I would also like the ability to control access to content on the kid's Kindle's without having to set up their own Amazon account. For example, I have ordered romance novels on my Kindle only to have them appear on the carousel on my daughter's Kindle."
Like tablet but hearts switching around game you stops during play can't recover have to turn off tablet restart to play a new game this is very frustrating home there is a fix
"It's a nice tablet. I think it should have a Micro SD Slot. So far I think it's a good value. I wanted a 16 GB model but, it was not available."
"I love the quality of the HD, photos look great, screen looks sharp. The tablet size and model is very nice.  So happy I upgraded."
"Loved it so much that I bought a second one just for me. Mine has many more advantages and cost me more money, but it is wonderful."
"The device crapped out 3 days into my trip to Peru. It was only 4 days old.  Problem was my connection with the web via wifi and after 3 days would no longer log in. It did work for the first 3 days, although I was having lot's of trouble figuring out how to use it. Just, one day it didn't log into the same wifi spots I had been already using in the town i was in...Tried several different wifi spots. same deal. Tried contacting Amazon and they were of little help. I had to rent a computer to contact Amazon since my Fire was of no use. The tech said there was nothing they could do unless I was somewhere were I could turn on the wifi and turn it off. They said they needed the info off the back of the router and what kind of computer they had (the wifi hotspot). I was in Peru, using someone else's comp and didn't speak Spanish. The Fire HD does NOT come with an instruction book. You have to be able to access the internet to get any kind of help. So if the device won't log into the web, you are screwed. The amazon techs told me to go to the forums and ask for help. I gave up as I didn't see how anything was going to help.. I spent $100 to get a device to make traveling easier and it wasn't worth 10 cents in the end. Then, when I got home, it  automatically started using my router at home, and works fine...What even happened?? Why did it work, then NOT then work again few weeks later. I don't trust it will work when I need it. They could have easily put an instruction manual on the device. There is a user guide but it wasn't much help with the kind of issues I was having. A printed manual would have been the most help since when you are having a problem, it doesn't work to have to see the help guide (on the device) in the middle of the issue. Especially when it is so incomplete. The kindle part was great and it worked wherever I was. Lucky I had put a book on there before I left since I wasn't able to add anything. I'm going to be looking at Apple pads.I can't recommendthis thing. Here is an addendum...Since it was working again, I took it with me on a trip a month later to Ireland. Of course it worked there too although would NOT send me my emails. I had to log onto the ISP site to access my email. What a pain. Sorry, this is NOT a good item. Plus when you agree to their terms to purchase, you give them the ability to constantly bombard you with ads for Amazon."
enjoy it
I love it.  This is my 3rd Kindle.
"nice display and should be handy on vacation. not so sure about photo storage. Thought that was free forever, not just 30 days! lots of free stuff for 30 days but what happens after that?"
Awesome
I love my kindle!!!!!!
"I love my Fire! Such a cool device! It's easy to work, fast and loaded with apps when you receive it!  Mine was already setup for me to start using! Thanks Amazon!"
took me a while to figure out how to download items and now it is frozen It takes me forever to get it to turn on and i tried to post an item on my facebook and the whole thing has frozen up.  miss my Apple
Great tablet! Love it!
Great device! Replaced my original Fire. Very fast processor and love that you can now print wirelessly
I had some trouble connecting to my internet and the games would end before I was done playing them.
"Amazonic tablet !!!  A very good deal from Amazon.com .  Video and Audio very powerful and entertaining to your senses . You are going to like it , for the price in comparison to the Apple products I would say it's a steal . A win , win situation for you . Moneywise !!!!"
love my new kindle . it makes bringing all your media with you so easy .
Perfect e reader and very nice for videos
I love it just having a little trouble with it not going to sleep.
Fire HD 7 speed on loading really amazed me!
Having always had Apple products there has definitely been a learning curve.  As I get more comfortable with it I am enjoying it.  There is a great selection of word games in the apps that my husband and I are enjoying.  I'm glad I decided to make the purchase.
"I'll give Fire HD 7,7&#34; HD Display 5 stars.  I'm very happy with my purchase."
Very limited to what it can do. And Amazon's customer service pertaining to the kindle is completely unacceptable.
Love it! Great picture and perfect size.
It is great.
Love my Kindle!!
I love this thing. I able to go all over the house and still cruise the net or read. It's a great companion to my custom desktop.
"This is my 2nd Kindle, and I love it as much as my first (1st gen) Kindle.  Easy to use, and small enough to take anywhere, and as always the Amazon customer service is for the most part the BEST in the business.  My first Kindle stopped working after about 18 months, and the warranty ended after 12 months.  But I called Amazon anyway to voice my disappointment, and without hesitation they replaced it for FREE!  That one action cemented me as an Amazon customer for life!  I used to favor Apple but found their customer service to be non existent, unless you spent several hours researching how to contact them, and once contacted they seemed to go out of their way to squirm out of helping you.  So in short, if you are looking for a great product with UNBEATABLE customer service, give Amazon a shot, and the first time that you have an issue of &#34;ANY&#34; kind, you will be a devoted Amazon customer as I am, as well as every friend of mine who ever took my advice to heart.  Each and everyone of my friends that took my advice have come back to thank me, after their first experience with needing help from Amazons customer service.  I am sorry if I sound like a commercial for amazon, but they are the ONLY company that I have ever dealt with that did not say &#34;I'm sorry sir, but your product is out of warranty&#34;.  To me that speaks volumes, especially in this age of corporate greed."
"I am somewhat disappointed.  The integration of apps for kindle and android from Google play do not work.  Though there are a large number of applications for android devices, this kindle device does not accept installation from Google play, even if you do some tricks suggested in web pages.  For some such applications, one can install from Amazon store, but for some, AMazon store does not carry.  The silk browser is also somewhat not very compatible.  I cannot download ebooks from local library or other public soureces, such as 3M. Overall, good for playing games, downloaded Amazon ebooks, and that's pretty much about.<br /><br />I will not recommend this to be bought.  Either iPad or some of the Android devices, such as Samsung's or ASUS's would be a lot better, since they can accomodate both Google android apps and you can seamlesslessly download Anazon ebooks also.<br /><br />I have given 3 star rating rather generaously, once again, because of the simplicity for games, size, and spped."
Perfect Tablet. I am really enjoying it.  I  would highly recommend it.
Absolutely phenomenal. My son loves playing the learning games on his kindle as well as watching Netflix once he has completed his required time of learning games. Definitely recommend.
"This is my third Kindle and the Fire HD is altogether different.  You need the book &#34;Kindle HD for Dummies&#34; or you will be opating blind with a lot of quirks and glitches. Probably when I have reviewed the book and more hands on with the Fire. Foe ebooks, the Paperwhite is easier too us, the<br />Fire has some odd surprises when reading ebooks and keeping you hand at the bottom of the screen seems to keep the page from jumping around and all of a sudden get a page from the built in dictionary.  To realize Fire's potential be sure to get a self-help manual."
It is much heavier than I expected. The size seemed okay but is awkward to hold in bed when reading. Maybe it is the case that adds weight. Either way I am better off with my phone and wish I hadn't purchased this device.
"Terrific. As good as, if smaller than, a tablet. The best thing is the fantastic Amazon support. Loads many apps/games. Love the free books, etc you only get from Amazon"
I like my new Kindle Fire 7.  I`m still learning how to get around in it.  As soon as that happens I'm sure I'll love it.
i love it but software can be buggy or slow
My second kindle. Love the kindle fire HD.
it seems so good so far but it is interfearing with my kindle downloads for books. I need to figure out how to move them to the reader
I bought this for my mother for mothers day and she loved it.  I do not believe nothing would have made her happier.  She loves reading and playing games on it.
Great tablet. A lot like my new Fire Phone.
It meets my expectations
I will NEVER buy another Amazon tablet or phone again after this experience.  I read great reviews on this product and it hasn't lived up to any of them.<br />It's been very slow from the moment I bought it.  Now after only a couple months it's randomly restarting all the time.<br />I wish I could get my money back.
"Love it, hours of entertainment."
I love mine!!
For the two that was brought one will be a child and the other one will for myself and I am in the process of completion of registration.
I am disappointed with the battery life. Lasts only 2 hrs and while charging the Kindle @the battery area Kindle gets really hot. I think I need a good battery. Can someone help me?
perfect fit!
"It's a great  device, just taking me a little bit  to get used to it."
This tablet is good and all but It has a bad camera. And also you can't get clash of clans from the amazon fire store. That's a huge defect.
"I had the previous model Kindle so I am familiar with it.  Regretfully, my last kindle's audio port stopped working after a year.  I'm hoping I have better luck this time. Otherwise I like the all round features of the Kindle enough that I ordered it again."
I Love my Fire HD this my 4th one
Can not rate. Does not work.  Had to send it back. Unable to exchange do to out of stock. Incovience.
"was what I wanted, works and looks good"
A solid tablet and a nice deal.
"I love this little tablet.  It is what I need for church and will fit nicely in my bag.  I already have the ESV bible downloaded to it and can not wait to use it this Sunday.  It is the one that I will take with me when I travel and can keep it with me.  It is easy to handle.  I found out that my charger for my phone works in this tablet, so I will only have to take one cord with me and can use it on my phone and on my tablet.  That sure is a plus for me.  I recommend this tablet to anyone.  The only thing that it does not have is:  You can not stream movies from it and there is no audio so that you can listen to books while you are in the car.  That is the only downfall."
Too new to give an accurate accounting but so far good!
"Its like a hand or foot, it goes wherever I go"
I absolutely love my Kindle!!!
"I thought this was the same as one I bought a couple of years ago - just newer and a little upgraded. Almost every option is different. I can no longer look up the definition of words instantly by touch, I have to wade through menu layers to turn wifi on or off & to find bookmarks that I have set. The GoTo feature is also more complicated and hidden. I don't understand the need for all the changes. At least my grandsons enjoy exclusive use of my old Kindle Fire HD."
"Smaller than I expected. Overall it's pretty decent, but this system does not play nice with Hulu which is disappointing."
"Good display and sound, poor battery life. Had a snafu on ordering on the  payment plan, and got TWO delivered because the order didn't cancel properly; had to pay $3.20 for a box @  UPS store because they wouldn't accept Amazon's packaging! So I had to wait for three days to get my credit card credited, AND pay $3.20 for their mistake! Not the best work they've ever done. Should have a more user-friendly experience out of the box (tutorial), but I do seem to like it for movies and YouTube, and of course coupled with my Prime membership it's a pretty good deal. That saved this review from being a 2 star."
love this product.
Great device love the rear view camera and all you can do with it. Keep up the good work Amazon best values going!!!!!
"I love my fire HD 7. Works great. I had the first kindle fire and it actually still works but the charger port doesn't fit tight enough to charge it. I had it repaired once already, so when it happened again I figured it was time to buy a new one. the people at Amazon were very helpful, and they gave me a great deal on this fire. this is the 4th generation and when I received it everything was already loaded back on it, which made it so much easier!! It took me a few days to get a cover for it, but after checking the office supplies stores I ordered the case that said &#34;4th generation&#34; and it fits perfectly."
"Very convenient to use and handle.  I like the size better than my iPad, and it is a lot faster when up or downloading."
Still learning how to use it and how it works.  A friend of mine loves it and I always wanted to get  one.  As soon as I get it up and running I know I will enjoy it as much as my friend loves hers.
I have the Kindle Fire and I absolutly love it. I read every day and it's nice to have all my books in one place. I love to play games on it too but mostly I love the reading.
"I'd had my Kindle Fire for like three years, and it was pretty worn-out, and this was great to replace it. The same great device but with some interesting new extras."
Good so far
I am having so much fun learning all the things I can do with it.
I really love my little tablet...
"Amazing, works great,clear picture with great sound."
Display is really good everything works as it should.  Girlfriend loves it for reading.
"Good product, bad camera quality."
"I love the kindle except there are a few apps not compatible with it etc Instagram and red Conoe app, hopefully those will be available soon but other than that I've been extremely happy with it"
The main intent of buying this device was to read kindle books. Although I have multiple apple products that I have been using to read kindle books ... This is by far the best ever<br /><br />I love the voice reader... It is very natural sounding and works well I the car.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a very cheap and well made reader that you take anywhere and not afraid of losing it
excellent
Love love love!!
HAVING PROBLEMS IN LEARNING. IS THAT A BOOK MANUEL WITHOUT HAVING TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT? IF YOU DO PLEASE MAIL ME A COPY. THANK YOU.
This kindle would have been a gotten a five star rating if it had a HDMI micro port.
Love
It is certainly updated from my previous Kindle and I need to get used to using all the things it can do.
My daughter bought this for me and I absolutely love it! It has a great battery life. The graphics are awesome! No complaints!!
Excellent! Kid friendly!
Love the color and detail
"It has great color, sound and is fast."
"I love my fair hd 7,7."
Like it
Its ok
I would like to see some instructions on how to use it to its full capacity.  I was able to get it up and running easily and am really enjoying it more than I thought I would.
I love it. It does more than I expected.
"Very easy to carry and use. Fits in pocket of cargo shorts and has games, books, web, etc..."
Very easy to use
It doesn't<br />I hate it
"Awesome, no issues!! Arrived earlier than anticipated!!"
"I like the fire. It has excellent, hardware. great build quality, and good battery life.  So why am I only rating this 3 stars?<br /><br />One answer is the fire OS which is really a fork off the Android OS.  The other is for reading the old E paper Kindles are just so much better.<br /><br />This creates many challenges for a power user.<br /><br />As a reader this distracts you with too many options, the color screen uses battery power faster, and gives greater I strain then Epaper.<br /><br />As a Tablet it feels overbuilt and yet caged in a small box.  While many of the same apps are offered on both the Fire and Android often with the same codebases small prevent key apps from running on this near tablet.<br /><br />Examples of apps that do NOT work on this device: Instagram, most calendar apps, most task managers, most email programs, most web browsers, and nearly any google app.<br /><br />By design Amazon has hit it mark, a powerful near tablet, limited to consume amazon products. For a few dollars more you can install amazon apps on a real Android tablet and have better experience."
"Arrived on time, great display."
I like it better than my first Kindle.  I find it very easy to use and it has plenty of apps to keep me busy.
"My nearly three year old grandson loved my Fire HDX tablet so we bought a Dragon touch tablet for him.  The Dragon tablet was much too slow for him, and not quite as bright,  also it developed a problem.  We returned the Dragon and bought a 7&#34; Fire HD and he absolutely loves it.  I like the fact that he can not order inside apps just by pressing a button, (He once bought a $14.99 movie on my tablet).  I would recommend the Fire tablet any day.  It can accommodate any age!"
Awesome tablet~versitel !
Love my kindle fire!!!
like that I can read book onit.
"Quite disappointed that what is supposed to be a quality piece of electronics, does not come with any sort of instructions for those of us who are still even partially electronically illiterate.  The so called instructions on Google or even Amazon were nil.  Fortunately - just when the 30 days were nearly at an end, a friend happened to come by, and lo and behold, she gave more help in 15 minutes that we were able to find in 15 days.  It is, for this reason, the review only got 3 stars.  My Nook came with a BOOK of detailed instructions - what I like to call, instructions for a dummy.  Not everyone in the universe knows how to work this.  Think about this.  Seriously think about even one page of instructions."
I love my Kindle Fire!  This my second Kindle Fire and I love this version even more.
Great!
Our daughter was ecstatic to get this for her birthday.  I love the parental controls and it was a nice surprise to find out that the cd's we've bought throughAmazon over the years were alteady in her library of music.
"So far, I'm very pleased with it. Noticeably better quality display and sound than my three year old Fire.  Same ease of operation.  If you liked any of the previous versions of Kindle, you should like this one as well."
"Wi-Fi dropped out after a week. Says that it's on, but it won't reconnect. Totally disappointed...sending it back!"
Holy crap.  Only an organization as driven as Amazon could fuxor Android to the point of near uselessness.  I am going to have to put a new ROM on this thing because the braindead foxing morons that did this listen more to their masters than their customers.<br /><br />Vile.  Bad.  Sucky.  Slow.  Creepy.  These should make good search terms for this release.  Ah.  The hardware is ok.
The Kindle fire hd 7 is nice. You can play some great games on it ( that you can't play on the fire tv stick). It's hard to play most of the games with such a small screen. Haven't tried book reading yet.
Great reading device. Blows the nook out of the water
very fast.  directions are easy to understand.  graphics are excellelnt
"I'm in love with it. The transition is smooth. Organization is really simple and very easy to operate. The screen is perfect size and pixel is high quality. Not hard on the eyes at all, wether it is in bright, daylight or even at night. Totally recommend."
It was more than I expected
Perfect for my kids
"As far as the communicated expectations of this product, I have no complaints. I started out with the first generation Kindle Fire, and the this one is faster, and more updated by far. HOWEVER, what I'm about to say is something I didn't know when I purchased it. I have several apps that worked perfect fine on my older app. The developers of those apps have not updated them, and they are no longer compatible with my NEWER kindle. OR, they are only available now in the google play store. This is disappointing and I may have reconsidered my purchase had I known this.  As I talk around, this is a common complaint with the kindle vs getting an android or apple product\. So, if you are in the market, be sure that you are aware of the app issue. If that is not a big deal to you, then you will love this wonderful kindle tablet.  It's a great tablet in all other ways."
My Daughter Loves it very happy with it.
"The Fire HD 7 is not as user friendly as other Tablets, but I like it to download books.  I'm enjoying the tablet so far."
In love with my new Kindle Fire HD
"Loving it so far. I'm using it for my business and the Amazon register. I found it so hard to do on my phone, the fire has made it much easier and I'm loving the register swipe rate!"
The unit is fine. You have to pay extra not to have advertisements pop up which I think is rude. Delivery was very slow I missed a date for a birthday present. I give the unit 4 stars. I give the delivery and the advertisement issue 2 stars. an overall 3 stars.
nice unit. Easy to use.
ok
Perfect
"I like it, but I can't get Google games"
We love our kindle fire HD and we use it all the time and it just so awsome.
love it!  so far
Bad
I seem to have to do a hard reboot after a couple hours using the device.  The touch screen loses sensitivity and sometimes goes back to home page.
LOVE THE FIRE TABLET.  GOT FOR THE CHILDREN AND THEY LOVE IT TOO.
"I have tried quite a few lower priced tablets, for the money, you won't find any better than the Kindle fire hd 7&#34;. It has speed, a great picture and stereo speakers. It is sturdy and built to last. Get the 16 gb you'll be glad you did. Watch videos, play games, email, download, upload no problem. The only drawback is camera quality but I can overlook that. Great product, Great price. I love it!!!"
"I mostly read eBooks now and wanted something smaller than my older Xoom tablet. The Fire opens quickly with a brilliant screen. There are enough apps (news, weather, etc) for my purposes. Apps load quickly especially Weather Bug which was always &#34;hit or miss&#34; on the Xoom.  It's smaller size makes it much more portable. I am very pleased with this product"
Not what I was looking for. It's too similar to the Kindle I already have. Still a good product.
This is a great tool
"I received this as an earlier Father's Day Present.  My Kindle Books automatically transferred to the device.  Compact and light, I use it every night to read."
As good as advertised
Can't wait til I know how to use it.still trying.
"I love my new kindle!  It is fast, the screen is crystal clear, the sound is greatly improved.  I love the size ,and it's light enough to carry wherever I go.  I'm very happy with my new device and recommend to all!"
I love love this kindle I read my books play games read the.paper
Speeeeeeeegettiiiiii!!!!!!
It takes amazingly Sharp and clear photos and videos. Apps are installed faster including some apps I couldn't install on my old fire. All in all I'm very satisfied😊😊😊
"Received this as a mothers day gift. I love it!!! Everything I want and more. I'm on it all the time, instead of my laptop. The only thing I don't like are the ads, but for the price, you can't go wrong."
I am not sure I like this model....I miss my fire hdx....the screen gets smeared all the time and is hard to clean.  It is slower and it keeps.telling me that I am not connected to Wi-Fi when I am.  Can't afford the fire hdx at this time but I will upgrade when I can.
Easy to use and great addition to ways to use media content.  Very pleased. Faster wireless internet connection than my computer.
The display is very clear and sharp. The surfing speed is excellent. I wish it had a better battery life.
I think it's great.  I bought it for my 6 yr old son. He loves it<br /> He was so excited that it came with a camera.
"Amazon is right: very light and so easy to carry. Quite fast, and quick access/link to favorite mobile site.  It rocks!"
"I love the Fire HD 7, it's amazing!  I had the old Fire kindle and loved it but when I couldn't charge it anymore, I bought the Fire HD 7 because of the screen size."
"It's a nice little gadget, but just wasn't for me. It wasn't what I wanted or thought I needed. Being older it was just too busy and I think I will check out the smart phones instead. The first thing that upset me was the packaging. I was very unhappy with that. I had ordered another glass item (a bottle) and whoever packaged it just threw it in with the product, That was the first downfall and then from there on, well, I decided to send it back. Amazon is a wonderful company and I have order numerous items for years. This item just didn't do it for me."
"I really love my new Kindle HD - however, I was quite upset that within 2 days afterward, you sold them fifty dollars cheaper!!!"
The product has exceeded my expectations so far. I enjoy reading and it has been easy to use.
I love the new Fire but it does not hold a charge as long as my previous kindle.  The case I bought is excellent.
There are some things I do not like. It doesn't perform nearly as well as the older version.
Serves the purpose I bought it for very well.  Reading and listening to books is the only reason I had an iPad - gave that to my daughter.  Use this now and still have adequate email and good web browsing function.  Very happy so far.
It was easy to get started.  I am still learning how to use it.
Love this tablet
I like it
"great product, arrived on time , daughter loves it will purchase from this seller again"
goos
"It's great. Only negative is it doesn't have as much side borders to hold onto, but screen is the same as my first Kindle.  Love that it came this time with a plug in adapter that I didn't have to buy separately."
It's nice. @ first I had difficulties setting up but I later found out how to figure it out. I was surprised though that it didn't have a pamphlet inside telling us on what to do.
I've only had a few moments to discover the ins and outs. I knew when I bought it that 16gb was a confining amount but when I ordered it I was not aware that it could replace my ipod. In spite of the limitations of memory I find that I'm very pleased. now if I could find a way to carry it as easly as my ipod it would be great.<br />John
"I really hated to leave my old kindle because it was so user friendly - I don't do change well.  My husband got a Fire HD 7 2013 and there were some features I didn't like about it; however, this new kindle fire HD7 has the best of all the features I like.  I especially like the power button being located on the top rather than the bottom, my old one had the button on the bottom and I would sometimes turn it off while reading because I would accidentally hit the power button.<br /><br />The one feature I liked in my old kindle that the new one doesn't have is a light that shows orange while charging and turns green when fully charged. This made it easy to see at a glance when charged."
"I am amazed with my new Fire HD. It seems it can do everything. Reprinting its own photos downstairs on my wireless printer. There are so many apps to choose from I can't decide, and that's just the beginning. still lots to learn.. Thanks for a really neat tool."
I find it different from my last Fire HD and with very little instructions for use.
"I don't know how Amazon can do what other companies can't but their tech support is &#34;spooky&#34; good! I've used Mayday on my Kindle and it has worked every time with no wait. I have also sent a request for support through their web site and no sooner click the send button and my phone rings, that's the &#34;Spooky&#34; part I mentioned early. With other devices I own it's a long wait on hold just to speak to someone who doesn't have a clue and can barely speak English. I just phoned Brother's support for a new printer I purchased that won't install and when I called the support number for Brother I got a voice message that said, &#34;There is no one here to help you now, Goodbye&#34;.  Amazon, why don't you make printers and computers! I have made many purchases from Amazon and have needed to return a few but always the customer support has been amazing! I'm tempted to phone Kindle support to see if they can help with my printer."
"I'm not totally comfortable with this yet  but the color and images are fantastic,  At present I am going to keep this just as a back up to my original Fire, so when that one bites the dust I'll have a backup on hand.  I may try playing with the camera, but really, I'm not familiar with a lot of this device except for the screen display, which is definitely worth a 5-star rating."
I am still setting it up..love the clear pictures...Really like larger keyboard. Sound is great.much lighter. My big problem is opening the box and absolutely no idea of how to set up. If this had been my first tablet. I would have been lost.  I did contact help. 2 days later got answer that did not help. I accidentally found how to Set up or find set up info.At least include a quick start info. Yes had number to call but we all.have lived through those calls! I cannot tell.more till.I get started using instead of trying to set up. At the moment I am floundering in a cloud installation!.
Not really a lot of room for anything else once you put books on here.
Love it.
"My Kindle Fire which I received as a gift, worked great for 18 months and now will not turn on. The only advice from Kindle support is to hold the power button for 30 seconds. This apparently works for some but unfortunately not for my kindle. Unless you have purchased an extended warranty there is no other help for except purchasing another kindle. At first you are told that as an on line store there is no repair available. Then you find out that there IS repair but it is only available if you are under warranty. After much research I have discovered that this specific problem is very common with the Kindle. There are even some online posts showing you how to open your kindle and how to get it to reset."
Disappointed.  Display measures 6&#34; not the 7&#34; advertised. Also heavier than I thought it would.  I have a Fire same size and liter weight.
a very good product.  I enjoy the display and the graphics.  It is very easy to use and just the right size for me.
"My fourth Kindle, great picture, great reading, easy to figure out how to use it.<br />what more can I say...oh and nice and light also.....cannot read outside with it though, have to use my paperwhite for that.."
I love my new kindle love the hd so clear and so easy to use!
"This is by far the best tablet that Amazon has made! The graphics are wonderful and apps load and operate much faster with the new processor! I have the kindle fire HD 2012 version, and I wondered if there was a big enough difference between that tablet and this one to justify buying it. And I will say, there is a huge difference! This truly is the best tablet I have ever purchased and I do not regret this purchase! there are new volume buttons on it for more convenience and it is a very strong tablet!"
I received the Fire HD 7 as a gift and it's awesome! I use it everyday for my internet needs and I'm well satisfied.
I just love it!
Love It !!!
I love it.  I lost the first one I had.  I'm a picture person.  This one has a lens on both sides.
"excellent product,  my 3rd one"
"It was easy to setup and connect to my account, perfect size, good price, and a great gift."
Love it
I was very pleased with my kindle purchase. Only difficulty I am having is retrieving e-books that were in my prior kindle that I have not read yet.
Didn't think I'd use it much but had some hospital waiting room sitting coming up so took the plunge and purchased one. Easy to use. Loaded a couple of games and a couple of books. Spent the day in the waiting room and was even able to stream video from the guest wifi the hospital provided. The patient came through just fine and played a bit on it too while waiting to be discharged. Still getting to know my way around it but now it's going with me everywhere. Will have to load some games and books for the grandkids. Remember to take the charger along and plug in whenever you get a chance.
"This is not my first Kindle,but I would have nothing but a KIndle tablet.My 1st Kindle fire had a problem with the charging receptacle and eventually wouldn't work.Amazon as usual with the great customer service gave me some credit for the old one and I was able to get a new Fire,still happy with that one but I fear for the same charging problem with this new one"
This is our second Kindle! Love the Kindle Fire HD! Quickly shipped! We will buy another one!!
"This is my 3rd kindle and it's the best. I take it everywhere with me. And anywhere there is wireless I am hooked up. Good quality picture/graphics, fast and plenty of apps."
Replaced my Orginal (4 year old)  Kindle fire and love it.
It is not to bad so far.
"I purchased my tablet less than 3 months ago, and it can't keep a charge. I'll have it fully charged at night, won't use it then the next day it's completely dead."
"The capabilities are almost limitless.  Unfortunately, my personal capabilities are not to that high level.  Although I now can turn on/off wifi reception, that is about all I can do.  I have yet to learn how to move a book from device to cloud.  There is no easily accessed manual to read, nor does a paper one come with the unit.  A further stress factor is I often have difficulty finding the page on Amazon.com where there is information regarding my Fire Kindle, and how to resolve issues.  I miss my old dead kindle whose only capability was to easily order and download books, and I could listen or read from it.l"
It is easy to use.  The screen is easy to read and the books easy to download.  I like the cover that can stand up for hands-free viewing.  It was a birthday gift from my husband Dennis and a pleasant surprise.  Sharon Reedy
Love it
"From the first kindle fire I had, I've fallen in love with them. Kindles are great devices for a variety of uses and they truly are worth the money. For $100 this one of the best"
"If I had to rate based solely off of performance I'd give it 4 stars. It lags a little bit but it's barely noticeable. Also the camera quality is kind of bad.  But one thing that really gets on my nerves about the kindle fire is that the background wallpaper is just black. You can't change it to a picture of your choosing, you can't even change it to a different color. Black wallpaper. That's all you get. So it makes the kindle feel very impersonal when you're on the home screen. That's why it gets three stars from me. Also it takes a very long time to charge but on the plus side it lasts a decent amount of time so that's always good.  If you're looking for something you can read on and browse on the internet in the same manner that you could on your smartphone then this is for you. If you want something that can do a little more and is better quality all around, then save for an iPad.  I personally just wanted something to read on and watch Netflix so I'm fairly satisfied with this tablet."
I am enjoying this item this the first time I'm giving a review of any product
"i love it, it is so much faster than my old one and so many new features.  I love it"
My  5 year old just loves it!! I also purchased the protective child casing for it as well..excellent product all the way.
"A nice upgrade from my 2012 - then again...it was time for a new one.  My husband got this for me in Pink because it's a favorite color of mine, but it will be hidden when I put a case on it.  It was a sweet thought though!"
Great gift. I am liking it more than my ipad.
Very happy with my purchase I love amazon
Functions good .Easy to use. Larger would be nice.  I have to work the ability to use my internet which looks difficult..
Great value for the price.
"Perfect fit, perfect style, in pink polka dots!"
Exceeds my expectations. Great deal for the money. It works very well. It may well replace my laptop entirely (not my desktop) since it does more than what I need when away from home. Wonderful product.
Great value!
Outstanding product easy to use
This is my BEST e-reader by far!!!
I absolutely love it and the color I ordered!  Meets my expectations.
So far i like it.
I Love it!!!  It is just what I needed which was more storage space and a camera!!  I love Amazon and their Kindles and won't buy anything else.  Their customer service is always excellent.  Thanks Amazon!!
Perfect for what I needed.  I was little upset to see the larger version on sale right after I bought it.  I wish amazon had an automatic price change policy. I feel like they could have notified me of the change.  Not sure if I can return it.
I am really enjoying my Kindle Fire..It has great features...very durable...I dropped it..still works fine...Speakers even sound great to play my music as I am an Amazon prime member so get loads of music for free.
"This is a wonderful kindle EXCEPT its battery only holds a charge for ONE DAY.  Otherwise, no complaints."
I'm enjoying it.  Its a &#34;replacement&#34; birthday present from my sons.
It's great for the price!!!
I love it!
"Great Kindle. I have owned every Kindle in the series at one time or another.  This Kindle will &#34;reenergize&#34; quickly when plugged in, and has a great audiobook function. The only problem I have ever had with Kindle is I wish you could change which hand used to turn pages, sometimes I would like to turn pages with my left hand."
"This works very well, but I bought it thinking that I could hook it to my TV to display Amazon prime movies and TV.  Unfortunately, (and I'm sure it must say so somewhere in the fine print of the description) it does not have that capability (unlike earlier models) so I ended up having to buy a fire TV stick.  The Kindle Fire 7 is quick and has lots of things that I will use, so I don't mind having it.  I don't like the idea, though,  that it appears you have to switch to Amazon mail if you want to check your e-mail on this Kindle.  I kind of thought Amazon was above that sort of thing."
Love it!
"It's ok for price , should have went with larger screen"
"Bought this for my girlfriend and it's practically night and day compared to her iphone or my ipad.  It's slow, freezes a lot, things don't open, you have to pay to get rid of ads, etc..  BUT for the price, it does its job."
Enjoying my Kindle Fire especially the camera
I love my new Kindle Fire HD!
Great fun
Fast operation...awesome display. Keyboard q bit clumbsy
Loved it<br />it was gift to my husband
Yes I love it
Dig it...
Still trying to figure it out
As advertised.  Wish it was available in 3G or 4G and not just Wi-Fi.
My third Kindle ...it just gets better all the time
Great product to date
"exactly as advertised; am enjoying watching &#34;Bosch&#34; immensely, picture is so clear it almost jumps off the page.  Love this toy."
"I adore my kindle! it has become another appendage, I carry it with me wherever I go!<br /> When I found one needed to be replaced, due to a technical problem, I had to think about it for a bit. I took so long the nice man wondered if there was a problem, I solemnly replied, &#34; W-e--l-l, how long will I have to be without it?&#34; He replied, &#34;You won't have to go without it, we're sending you a replacement, and when  you get your new one, you can send us the damaged one, no charge!&#34; &#34;Okay,&#34; I said, &#34;I only hesitated because I thought I was going to have to go without it for a few days! &#34;<br />All the things that I thought would never be useful to me, I enjoy, like Pinterest, the weather app,  games,and so on, you get the point!<br />Oh yes, I forgot about books, I read voraciously! I get to read books, as much as I want, without breaking my arms due to weight, even paper-backs are heavy! So if anyone is stalling, don't!<br />I say try it out, if you don't like it, return it and get your money back. However, I predict once you've got it, you'll be just as reluctant as I was to let it  go!<br />There's much to like, little to dislile!<br />Save a tree, buy a tablet"
It is a nice little unit.
"I haven't had time to really check out everything.  But, happy with it."
"This is my 4th Kindle and I absolutely love it.  I still have to figure out how to share, or print pictures from this.  There is no SD card or such to remove and print from, but I'll figure it out or someone will post the answer some where."
Very user friendly...love it
"Very nice, good color as well"
This is really a great tablet. I like it a lot.
Great device for internet purposes as well as reading and streaming video. On wish there was capability for plug-in micro sd memory card
Love my new Kindle Fire HD! This is my 2nd Kindle and I would definitely recommend this
I love my new Kindle Fire.  Still exploring all of its features. Very compact and user friendly.  Hard to believe all of its features as compared to my old iPad that was much bigger and heavier and costs at least 4 times as much.
"What an amazing device.  So much more than just a reader. Ability to check my email, weather, world time, internet shopping, play games, music, video, Skype, camera, etc."
Exactly as expected. Fast shipping!
Love this kindle! Great product at a great price and shipped to me quickly.
I love it. It's so easy to use
Has everything that I need.
Awesome
"Works great with Dish, Google, and Kindle - not so great with trying to get Outlook.com email."
"I am really loving it!  Not real technology minded, so there is lots to learn.  But so far basics are working fine!"
Bought this for my three year old... enough said!  She loves it and it is not damaged in anyway!
"The text to speech function is totally messed up.  I loved it in my previous Fire but this one is just nasty.  Every time that annoying chime that announces an email comes on, the text to speech shuts off and I have to re-start it.  This happens about once or twice a page.  So miserable.  This was my favorite part of using the Fire tablet as a reader, but it is getting quite exasperating."
This is my 3rd kindle. I upgrade and give my older ones to people.  I do not know how I ever survived without it.
Very nice
"Excellent product, couldn't live without it."
I'm loving the Kindle Fire HD.  Great for games and books!
"too many ads.  I enjoy playing words, there is an ad between every word.  Book also goes blank often and I have to turn it back on even though I have set it not to turn off.  The cord is too short cannot use while its charging.  This is my second Kindle Fire the first was more user friendly.  Now print this<br />7402ester"
Love it.
Love my Fire.  Great speakers and picture.  Easy to use.
Love my kindles!
"I'm on the second Fire--took the first one back because my email came in the TRASH folder.  Calls, calls--went to the &#34;developers&#34; and for a week all was well.  Now, I'm back to my email in the Trash folder--WHAT GIVES?  Trying to get myself to attempt another call, when I have an hour or more to sit on the phone!"
"Amazing my son loved,and the camera wow"
It does everything I need it to and more.
"This is my new favorite tablet!! But this reviews will have it's pro's and con's so lets begin<br /><br />Pro's : love the screen, as someone who has had multiple android tablets and an ipad i have to say my kindle is my favorite as far as battery life, portability and user interface. The battery will last all day of regular use (playing games, checking emails, surfing the web, netflix, etc.) I originally had a HD6 but i felt it was just a tad bit too small for me (i want a tablet not a phablet) the upgrade was a must for me. Now for the color...I love the white!! this was a great idea for amazon to change up the colors. A big pro that made me upgrade to the HD7 was the payment plan, 40$ a month for a couple months is definitely something that appealed to me and was the deciding factor in getting it.<br /><br />Con's : in upgrading from a HD6 to a HD7 i noticed the build felt a bit cheaper. Strangely enough the HD7 is lighter than my HD6. Another issue is that my HD7 apparently doesn't play some of the games i wanted. I had assumed a bigger kindle meant more capabilities for mobile gaming but apparently that isn't the case. Now to bring up the elephant in the room... the app store... It's a bit rough transitioning from a android/apple tablet with a store so vast. It's a step down i will admit the games and app store is not up to par with google and apple BUT!! It is getting there.<br /><br />Bottom line: This tablet is a must if you're in the market for one, I love the look and the feel. I have a friend that spent way more on a super nice ipad and all he does on it is watch netflix, i spent literally a fraction of the price for the same thing! The app store shouldn't be a deal breaker..if you're looking to play games go buy a video game console!! I play gameboy color and advanced games as well as super nintendo and nintendo games on my kindle (all it takes is a google search)<br /><br />Just upset i bought mine a week before they knocked the price down!!! &#62;:( still worth it.ill worth it."
Bought this for my girlfriend to use reading books and playing the occasional game.  She loves it.  Great for reading eBooks and more.
Love it
"Well worth the 99 bucks, runs smooth and fast. And if you have Amazon prime to go with it you won't be bored anytime soon. Didn't give it five stars for the reason that the battery seems to run down a bit fast (though that's  the Case with most of these kind of devices)."
I didn't like the fact that you couldn't download any internet search engines like yahoo. It always comes up with Amazon.com
Lovely birthday surprise!
It is a bit more complicated to use than I expected.  I got it for someone else to use (78 year old) and it is difficult to explain to them how to get the &#34;hidden&#34; home key and systems menu since they are not visible and they are always forgetting how to get out of a screen.  I think it is better for a much younger generation.
Great for my 5 year old.
"I was expecting this Kindle to be bigger with HD quality, what a letdown!!! Keyboard I can barely see. Can tell no difference in size. I want to return it but threw away box and all the info. I registered it so I'm not if I can send it back. Don't waste your money on this Kindle! If you have the old Kindle Fire, KEEP IT! It is much better than,this one. I am going back to my old Kindle Fire and not sure,what I will do with this one. Very very disappointed!"
"I bought this for my 6-year-old son, and it's been really great so far!  I love the price most of all, and I love that it can do just about anything an iPad can do. The size is great for him. The charge lasts a long time, and recharging doesn't take long. My son is playing some educational apps, and I have read some books on it. We love it! One thing I didn't realize before I bought the Fire was that the Freetime program that limits your child's use is actually something you have to subscribe to and pay for. I thought it was a service that came with the device. Oh well. I can still set up a child's profile for him that keeps him limited to what he can do and access, so that's cool. Still, compared to the iPad, this is much much cheaper and just as good. I would say with the iPad, you're getting more luxury as far as appearances are concerned. This is a great educational tool to keep my son engaged through the summer."
The best quality in a tablet
Better than I hoped for!  I replaced a first generation kindle fire with this one and I'm so happy I didn't buy a different make.  I love this tablet and it does everything the old one did plus so much more!!
LOVE IT!!!!
"Inferior in comparison with Nexus 7, even taking price into account"
"Love, love, love it!"
awesome
I have enjoyed using my HD 7 everyday since it was given to me as a gift from my children.
Ok service
Picture wonderful downloads great quick easy to work with Amazon product. Love it
I like it. The only disappointment I have is...I can't put Google hangout on the tablet.  But other than that its a great tablet.
"I bought my grand daughter one for Christmas, liked it so well I had to buy myself one... I also have one of the older one's and it is still working great..."
As good as the six....and bigger.
When it's WORKING - my Kindle FIRE is GREAT. Unfortunately - this is the THIRD Kindle I've owned. The battery on the first one died (could not charge it.) The second Kindle would &#34;freeze up&#34; after running for a few minutes. Both &#34;problems&#34; could NOT be fixed by the Best Buy Geek Squad. Since I foolishly did NOT get the warranty with them. They were useless. THIS time I did get the warranty - so I'll probably be fine!
"This device is everything I expected it to be.  I can do everything I used to do on my laptop plus take photos like I used to on my smartphone.  I must admit that I have been using it as an ebook more than anything else since I purchased it because there's a nice selection of Kindle ebooks available for free on Amazon.  The Fire Stick app is also a nice feature.  I have only had my Fire HD 7 for a week, and I'm still checking out all of it's features; however, I'm very pleased with my new tablet so far."
Fantastic reading device! I wore out my Nook and was using a Galaxy Tab 2. Seemed a waste just for reading. This is perfect and clear. Very easy to set up and navigate. Love it!
I like my little kindle!!! Only negative is I don't understand how to open my email.
works fine. first Ipad
I love it. It is faster then my  first addition Kindle fire. My first one lasted almost 5 years. When it died a slow death I lasted only 24 hours before I had to go buy a new one.  Being one with a reading problem I have found with the Kindle fire that I can go black background with white letters and it makes it easier for my eyes to track which was wonderful for when I read.
Excellent reader
Love it
I' a first time user of any type of tablet and found the Fire HD 7 to be easy to use. It is very simple to connect to wi-fi and all the other features that are included with it.
Really like it just wish I had known it doesn't work with Google Play.
It is great  I have a paperwhite kindle that I love  this one I can let kids play games and use internet and they are happy!
This is my third Kindle.
We are comparing my Kindle verse IPad Mini and so far I like the Kindle Fire HD as much if not more than IPad. Books are the major advantage plus $200 price difference. Sorry Apple
"The display is outstanding.  Images are very crisp and clear with great detail.  This is the 2nd Kindle Fire I've had, the first HD, and I couldn't be more thrilled."
IWasn't sure if I would like it. Was a 70th birthday gift. So far I'm really enjoying it.
really loving my new kindle. battery does die a little fast for me not sure why.. If i just let it sit and dont use it for like to day for some reason its close to dying. I think it may be from the ads screensaver that you have to either pay to remove or just deal with them. Think I may remove them  and see what happens.
"Easy to use ,like the camera plus getting email"
My son got the fire for his birthday and is loving it!
Great product.  Very compatible with younger children!
Still learning about how to use it. Wish it had come with a manual to read.
I bought this instead of the paperwhite for a vacation and its my new favorite toy.
Over all new ie
I might have liked the Fire HD 7 but I'll never know. It arrived with a partial battery charge and lasted long enough for me to download 2 movies that I wished to take with me then it went dead. I left it hooked up to the charger for three days and it never would charge. I sent it back.
Love it!
This Fire replacement doesn't hold a charge well and takes forever to charge back up.
Love it so far.  Still learning all it can do.
I have m/d of the eyes and cannot read this because of the gray on black printing and it is so sensitive to the touch<br />that items fly by and on to something else.. For the elderly with poor vision and arthritic hands this machine is a poor design<br />and I would recommend a different brand with a brighter screen and not quite so sensitive to the touch.
"Really love my new kindle, but the accessories for it are completely overpriced. Also I was hoping that you would get a trial period for prime. Don't care for limited apps but I enjoy it for the things I do use it for."
Awesome!
I haven't had a lot of time with this tablet my children claimed it and they love it
Love it! Very pleased with my new Kindle!
"I am really enjoying my new Kindle!  I have the first Kindle fire that came out and have enjoyed it...  it still works fine and I wasn't sure if I should splurge on a new one.  So glad I did!  I am impressed with the speed, graphics, and the sound that comes out of the dual speakers.  It even has a camera!  It's like a good quality tablet without the high price tag."
The sound is not as good as the kindle I bought in 2013. Other than that it seems good
Love it! And the sale price can't beat it!
I love my fire hd
Great change from my original Kindle. Great pleasure in having done the purchase
Awesome I love it
"Love my new Kindle Fire HD. I had a Kindle Fire before, but love the new features of the upgrade."
Online support is still superior to ANY other.
"some adjusting , but I love it"
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  The camera flexibility is her favorite feature!
Excellent graphics.  Not as versatile or user friendly as my wife's Asus  android 10&#34; tablet.  Nor does it hold a charge as well.  However for the sale price it is more than adequate.
love the new Fire it's so fast and the screen is so clear. This is my favorite ever
"I decided to treat myself and upgrade from the old model to this brand new one. Since my old one still worked really well I ended up giving it to my dad, and he really likes his. I really like how the actual kindle itself is colored, I think that's a nice touch & there's some great color options. I of course had to pick the magenta/pink one because of how pretty it looked. So far I'm really happy with my choice to upgrade. The biggest selling point for me was that this one has two cameras, one on the front & the other on the back. Now I don't have to awkwardly hold the tablet to try and take a picture of something. It also seems a lot faster than my old one, it might be because I have less apps or it really is faster. This one actually came with a wall charger which my old one did not have, I was going to use my old one so this is just an added bonus. I did notice that the USB cord it comes with is shorter than the old one, which is  a slight disappointment. Overall I would definitely recommend upgrading to this newer model, you'll be glad you did it!"
"This was a Birthday Gift and I love it.  Haven't mastered it all as of ye,t but learning."
Love my new Kindle HD!!!
I wish I could get my nook books to load on this tablet
Love it faster love taking pictures easier to read on.
Great small tablet for the price - would buy it again
THIS fire HD is as good as my larger one.
"I am disappointed in the storage space and the parental controls.  I bought this for my 11 year old son to replace a Nexus 7 (1st Gen).  It was between this and a Galaxy Tab 4 7&#34;.  I settled on the Kindle because the affordable price and Parental Controls.  If I could go back in time, I would have bought the other device.  I was incredibly disappointed in the actual storage space (5GB of total 8GB).  His Nexus had excess of 6 GB.  I also found the Parental Locks very difficult to set up and manage.  I had to go to several different screen to set them up fully.  One scenario that illustrates the frustration of the Parental Controls is as follows;  my son wanted to set a timer for doing a chore, he did not have access to the built-in clock app.  When he alerted me to that fact, I went to give him access to that app, only to find out that the built-in clock app did not show up as an app I could give him access to.  I had to download another clock app, just so I could give him access to a clock app.  I do not recommend this product."
Traded in my old one and I love it.
"I am a small business owner and when I called amazon in regard to my first kindly not powering on the rep. Did not try to resolve the problem her only suggestion for me was to buy a new Kindle, which dud not fit any of my accessories that I had previously purchased. To my dismay she also charged me for shipping fees and taxes. To add insult to injuries there was no charging equipment! !!!"
"I Love this 2014 Kindle Fire 7 HD. This is my fourth Fire and by far my favorite. I had the first generation 7 inch and 8.9 inch. I have given them away.  I also have the 2014  - 6&#34; which is nice for carrying in my purse, and for reading a book, but it was a bit small for use on the web or for apps. The 7&#34; display is perfect!"
Can't download alot of apps...tends to power off when it wants too...will not recommend this to anyone
"It is , as was the original Kindlefire , a handy device and easy to navigate.  The only negative is a minor one and that is all the unsolicited advertising as you swipe to reach your desired goal.  Otherwise I would recommend it, especially for travel as it is compact and not too weighty."
My 5 year old son got this for his birthday and loves it. I have put parental settings on it to limit how long he can play games.
"My issue is not so much the product thou I have bought 2 of these and only one had arrived and I'm finding that it doesn't keep a full charge long. I noticed that I fully charged it at 8:00 am and turned it of but by 2:00 pm the same it was down to 20% charged and I never used it. now this concerns me because I have 2 of the 6&#34; tablets which I'm having problems with the storage as well as the fire phone that I'm having a major issue to set-up the phone. Now I know there my be a feed back sheet for each of these issues but at this time I don't quite feel like doing that and the pressing problem I'm dealing with now has to do with the last fire HD 7 7' that I ordered and was supposed to be delivered to day which the tracking is showing delivered, well it was not and I'm tired of trying to talk to a Vender that appears not to be listening as I have called several time today only to be cut off twice so I'm going to kick it up a notch as I have reported several times that UPS were dropping all the orders addressed to my partner to the USPS and stating it was delivered  just to stop the clock and the orders were not delivered for another 3 or 4 days as the USPS has their own style of delivery which is not what I'm paying for and I demand to know what this is happening and my concerns have at been addressed and I'm still being charge. This must stop and it must stop now! How dare when I called to bring up the issue I'm hung up on? I want resolution not excuses. So in a nut shell the service and product are UNSAT.  Inform your partner UPS that address in my records that I place on the orders to  HEDGESVILLE, WV 25427-3003United States IS NOT THE POST OFFICE!"
I replaced my Amazon Fire that was the bigger size and was not disappointed in function.  Thought I'd miss the larger size but having the smaller 7&#34; size is convenient.  I love it.
very good
My second one.  Love it.  Gave my other one to my grandson
been excellent so far thinking of ordering another one
My kids love it.
I only play games on it and I love it.  I can take it any where and play and it fits in my purse.
LOVE them!!!!
I love my kindle. Only problem is I can't download the hoopla app on this one for some reason. I have it on my Kindle fire 8.9..
"I had a 1st generation, 3rd generation and now a 4th generation Kindle.  My first the charging connector went bad.  Could not get it fix.  So, I got a 3rd generation; still operating so I gave it to my hubby.  He got me the 4th generation Fire HD 7,7&#34;!  I was able to back up almost everything that was in my 3rd but not the one in my 1st.  Either way, this thing is fast and fabulous. I love it!"
"For the most part everything is excellent and I am well satisfied. I did not give 5 stars because amazon restricted downloads from all other apps except amazon. With that being stated, you have to spend money on your downloads, as opposed to getting it for free."
"I bought this tablet as my first foray into the world of tablets.<br />So happy with it. Surfing the net, you tube, movies, books, daily news and firefly are all extremely friendly and exactly what I need. Would highly recommend!"
MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT IT DPES NOT HAVE A NONGLARE SCREEN.  EVEN MY &#34;ANCIENT&#34; OVER-SIZED KINDLE HAD ONE.
Love it
"I can barely use it for what I intended. I wanted to take notes. Evernote doesn't work properly on here. The app selection sucks. I can't download third party android apps, even with the settings adjusted. I'm constantly being irritated by my apps shutting down. I can't read nook books. I can't read iTunes books. There exists a clearly superior tablet and it's not Amazon's. Personally, I don't think I'm ever buying amazon electronics again. It's not their forte. There are a few minor benefits (free app per day) but even Apple is trying to compete with that by doing a free app per week. Plus it's hard to remember to download a free app everyday. So don't let that be a selling point, unless you're going to ACTUALLY download an app everyday. Be honest with yourself. And I'm not just an Apple fan. Sony has a water proof tablet which is really nice and quiet large. And I think I want to get the Microsoft surface pro as a replacement for this.<br /><br />It isn't worth it. Buy from someone who focuses on electronics. Amazon's spreading itself too thin."
"I am really enjoying using the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; 16gb, it's alot of fun.  Easy to use, and very clear."
Best sound system of any of the 6 tablets I own.
"This is a great tool. Easy to navigate,great picture.nice camera.very portable."
"This is my third Kindle.  I wouldn't keep getting them if they didn't work very well.  By the way, #1 and #2 are still working great; having three allows me to keep them in different locations."
Love it! Does everything I need.
It is above and beyond of what I expected out of it
"I'm Thrilled and Amazed!  Purchased the tablet for about $20 less than the reader I was looking at.  Now I can read, access the internet and email accounts, and play games...all in HD!  I'm very happy with this unit!"
I really like it!
"I love almost everything about this device. A few things I do not like are the facts that I can't use the Play Store to download apps (Which I guess I can, but I have to go around a few things and I don't know if I want to yet), there is no SD card slot which I would really love, and the gallery is not very good as far as options go. The sorting of the photos is just awful, and they all just go into one big group instead of into albums. You can sort them by date uploaded or taken, but that does me no good.<br />Build quality seems to be very good, and unless it hit the right spot, I doubt dropping it onto anything less than concrete would damage it. The color is great, even though I have a case on it now which covers all the color except the front edge of the back case. Ease of use is pretty good, I have only had to look for this or that option or feature a few times, otherwise it is all exactly where I expect it to be. I LOVE the fact that the screen rotates upside down, as my phone will not and it drives me nuts sometimes. I've read quite a few books on my Fire already, and I have no problems looking at the screen for hours at a time without my eyes getting fatigued. The display is crisp and clear, and movies and games look fantastic. I really only use the tablet for Hearthstone as far as games go, but as long as you have a good network connection, Hearthstone works like a charm. The speakers impress me quite a bit. I have a bluetooth speaker that I was expecting to have to connect to it when I watched or listened to anything, but the built ins really are pretty good. Battery life is really great, and unless you are watching movies and playing games, which go without saying are massive battery drainers, you probably won't have to charge it every day. With very light use, mine has gone 4-5 days without charging, or 1 day of moderately heavy use reading and using the internet. In the future, I will definitely be looking into the HDX series of the Fire, and hopefullyby the time I am ready for an upgrade, they will add that VERY IMPORTANT SD CARD SLOT! ;)"
This is our with K Fire...love this one.
I love my new toy.
"I typically love our past kindles.  It works fine for everything except connecting to the Wi-Fi.  Since this Kindle is for my child, Wi-Fi is only wanted 25% of the time.  I'm hoping to have this cleared up.  We returned the first one we bought, but we are having the same problem with the replacement (it is new...not refurbished).  It could be a problem with our Wi-Fi, but our other devices (phones, ipad, laptop) are able to connect with little to no trouble."
"Bought this as a replacement for an older Kindle reader that was broken by a grandson. Couldn't be happier, 'though I didn't really think I needed  another tablet; however, the size and ease-of-use of this one makes it a great replacement. Light weight but powerful enough to be a great brother to my 2 Windows computers, 2 iPads, and 1 Android Moto G smartphone."
My 9 year old daughter loves it.
Never had an issue with this kindle and after a year is still performing solidly!
Simple to set up. Quick response. Very sharp display.
"Very easy to use and the touch pad is wonderful, not too sensitive like some are. The HD is beautiful. I have yet to hook it up to my TV to stream movies but hear from those that have the Fire that it is simple to do."
I am still learning to use my Fire HD 7&#34;7 but I do like it so far.
Awesome! Haven't put it down since I received it.  My free time in the evening has been sent reading!
I am loving the ease between apps.
Technology at its best
Not what I expected
"I don't think this is a very user friendlymachine but am getting used to it.  Not enough options on font size, not as comfortable to hold as the Nook (tried a friend's Nook).  Hard to understand how to navigate and no directions or tutorial included."
As advertised
"It's a pretty good tablet, better than I expected."
Ease of use right out of the box. Clarity of screen and downloads excellent. Apps and games easy to find and download
"Husband purchase and he is delighted.  Lighter than his original and of course, does many other services other than access his book selections!"
Love it
Amazing !!😀
It is  as averstized nice machine
This is my first tablet purchase and I am extremely happy with the quality of it.
"I absolutl love love love my new kindle. I had the first generation Kindle and gave it to my son and purchased a black Fire HD 3rd generation and gave it to my husband and he bought me the pink 4th generation! Love that it has a rear and face camera and video, wish that it had HDMI cord outlet instead of just being able to use it on the smart tv but its so worth it. Also loved that we got it on sale for 99.00"
Very  user friendly and I like it's size.
Everyone in my family has one! Perfect when you are traveling and dont want to take a bunch of books.
good I like it
Runs smoothly and it is easy to use and connect
I have not even got to use it much yet but I already know I love it.
"It was for my adult daughter as a birthday gift.  She loves it.  Great value.  It can do anything the bigger, more expensive tablets can do."
Love it; it is so easy to read at night and buying books is a snap.
User friendly and perfect fit for our family.  Love it!
Think it's pretty good
great
First tablet I've had  I really like it
😃
I'm extremely happy to have my kindle fire HD7. I love the screen and all the features. I purchased this mainly to read my books but it has so much more along with a lot of space.
This was a replacement for my first kindle fire because the charging connection became loose and kept falling out.  Now the replacement kindle won't hold a charge and has to be continuously plugged in to the charger. This is inconvenient for several reasons. Very frustrating.
I still dont know why people spend $400 on tablets when this does the same thing??
"Such a disappointment. For the price it is not worth it. 1. To clear the Carousel you have to do it all manually. 2. If you forget your password under Parental Control you have no other choice given to you but to reset the entire device back to Factory Setting. I have had this device for almost 3 years and have hundreds of books loaded, I cant afford to lose eveything just because I forgot my password. Also all the apps are absolutely terrible, clunky and antiquated."
Wife likes it.
"This thing is about worthless. It doesn't have hardly any apps available for it like on Android or iOS. The battery is terrible, and it is slow. I went to Wal-Mart and picked up an RCA tablet for $49 that does WAY more."
"Works fine, but the biggest let down is that I could not open attachments from my email."
I love it!!
Received just a week ago and in day one I had to do a system update. Then today my tablet would not turn on from sleeping mode.hope this just a glitch.
The special offers are really not intrusive. The kindle is lighter than my old one and works great. Had no problem logging in and going about business. The web surfing is better than on my old one. Love the ease of use and the enormous selection of books.
i order the 7 theysent me the 6 donot know how to return it so i guess i am stuck withit
Good stuff Amazon rocks
Should have spent less money
"I bought my first Kindle in January of 2012, but I'm not sure which version that would have been. It worked great for reading, some light browsing, and playing games every now and again. I even used it in college to help lessen the costs of textbooks since the digital versions were much cheaper. But it was always a little slow and a bit glitchy. These are NOT problems that I'm running into with this new version. It is very quick, and I like the new design overall. It reminds me more of a smart phone and is more user friendly. You can customize more of the screens this time around, but the same overall format of the separated tabs is still there. The display is beautiful and crisp... I never thought I'd have an HD display on a tablet! The fact that it comes in different colors is pretty cool, and it feels more sturdy overall. The earlier version has that glossy back to it, which is pretty, but seems like it would crack very easily. I'm really excited to use it as often as I can this summer!"
Very happy with it!!!!
A wonderful window to great content
Runs slower than my earlier Fire HD. Battery seems to be run down faster as well
love it
Wonderful
I love it.....it's like having an entire library at my finger tips....
"THE COMMERCIAL IS FALSE ADVERTISING,MY SON IS 3FEET 5INCHES TALL AND DROP HIS FIRE ON OUR HARDWOOD FLOORS AND THE TABLET SCREEN SHATTERED.WHEN WE CALLED AMAZON FOR A REPLACEMENT WE WAS TOLD THAT WE HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE @ $99 EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A WARRANTY TILL MAY 27TH 2016.WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!"
"The only downside of all its not google play and you dont have acces to really good apps that are in the google play, you can't installs the youtube app and google maps apps, but its not that great and if you install 3rd party apps days later yo will have problems, the other ting that i dont like it's the (CAROUSEL) I hate, and you cant not removed :S Ho and one more thing i don't like it does not have a SD card Slot For expand the memory. The only think i will goin to do with this tablet is to install linux ubuntu, i think it will be more usable.."
Luv it... meets my needs..grt...<br />ty😊
I recently bought my kindle and have absolutely loved it!
Grandson likes it very much.
exactly what i needed for home and work
Love the HD and the case I bought for it!  Neat little tablet.
Upgrades over prior kindle make it much easier to operate!
"I love my fire, I loved my last fire, I will love my next fire...."
It does all that I hoped it would be thank you. Very pleased with it. I really love the amazon up dates and notifications.
Does everything my I pad does but smaller.
I bought this kindle for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It offers enough apps that are suitable while providing parental control so that i can control her access to other functions.
kindle fire good.me like.
"My real rating is 3.5<br /><br />Dear Amazon,<br /><br />Bought this to watch stuff in the bedroom, the MLB at Bat app works great. Wish the Fire TV SticK's MLB at Bat worked as well. The Silk Browser is not a fun experience. Why the hard sell of free games when you are playing free games. The keyboad could be more user friendly, for other than watching videos, the device is quite limited. Web pages are soo small, that the browser function is almost useless. Other than emergency emails checks, browsing the web is not pleasurable.  The power switch is too small and should stick out a bit more. The cord on the power supply/charger is too short, a couple more feet would be great. Was going to return, but will use it for traveling, instead of my laptop.<br /><br />On a positive note. The battery life is better than expected. In 7 weeks of use it has not run out prematurely. I get 6 to 7 hours on a regular basis, and recharges quickly. When watching videos or ball games the picture quality is quite good. The original screen without a protector was very low glare, not harsh, and seemed scratch resistant. I added the Armour Suit screen protector and picture quality is now more harsh, and not as focused. Probably will remove whenever its time for a good cleaning. A nice surprise is that the speakers are good enough that headphones are truly a option.<br /><br />All in all a fair tablet. But internet browsing suffers due to the small screen."
"This product is advertised as 8GB but it only holds 5GB. This is clearly false advertising and I am disgusted companies such as Amazon will resort to tricking people out of their hard earned money for a few GB. I would return my device - because of this - but the time period for such actions has expired. The customer doesn't have access to the few remaining GB and the Amazon decides to eat up those GB with their own greedy purposes. Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with the FALSE ADVERTISING and would recommend NOBODY to buy this product, for fear that they will encounter the same problem I have. Amazon is a great company, but this just seems devilish to bamboozle people out of the GB that they payed for."
"It is wonderful we  upgrade every two years just because, to stay up to date. And also came in a different color but with the same data. Only situation I have with the tablet is you can't do the things that you used to do on the 2nd generation, like using the adapter to connect your tablet to the TV or any other device."
Wi-Fi disconnects because of high usage of memory. That should not happen. Otherwise great device and features.
Awesome sauce !!!
;)
"Very disappointed in Amazon. Bought a Fire HD7 on Saturday 6.13.15 to use it with a Google Chromecast. Downloaded Netflix app and it all worked as it should. Kindle auto updated shortly after and walla,  they no longer play nice. 3 other android devices I own work just fine with netflix and chromecast just not the Kindle. Contact Amazon support and they try to give me the run around (netflix's fault, google's fault etc.) until I box them in that all my other androids play well together with Chromecast.Then they say &#34;Oh yeah, I found it, it's a known issue and we're working on it. Until we decide to fix it you should use one of your other androids and your Kindle is SOL.&#34; Google the issue and find out it is due to an Amazon update, it is an issue Amazon has been aware of for over a year and they refuse to fix. General consensus on the web is they are trying to push users into using Amazon Fire stick & Amazon Prime video by not allowing their tablets to play with other devices. FOUL!!!! If they continue doing business this way I bet most customers will do what I am. Return the Kindle and buy a brand which plays nice (it's ethics 101 boys). Amazon, take your ball & go home. The rest of us will have a great time without you. Oh yeah, btw I'll be cancelling my Amazon Prime account shortly as well. I do business with companies who play fair and let each of their products stand or fall on their own merits not because you force me to. If you can't sell the better product then close."
Wish you where able to receive a certain amount of internet usage a month than pay for more if needed
"Really nice and sturdy, if it falls it protects it much like a cell phone cover, the screen never touches the ground. Light weight and the screen protector is a nice bonus, it doesn't get all greasy or smeared like the screen normally would."
"I love my fire, LOVE IT.  I only gave it 4 stars though because I wish it would hold a charge better.  I play games and read on it and have to switch halfway through a book to my laptop so I can charge it.  It is super easy to use, my 10 year old uses it quite a bit without any issues.  I take it everywhere."
How replace this device with another device before it is shipped
so far do goof
Easy-to-use love it!!
Im still reviewing....my five year old is happy with it.
"I bought this for my wife for mothers day from my daughter.  I had never even held one so when it showed up very quickly I got to set it up for her before mothers day.  The screen is beautiful.  The size is quaint.  The o.s. Feels all over the place.  And the ads.  They are everywhere.  The price was great, the reading ap is so nice with so much customization.  I would probably buy a galaxy next time but I could see some people liking it."
I started with a black & white Kindle reader. I downloaded a book and started reading it . When I was about 2/3 through the novel I received this Fire as a gift.. My wife had to go to a hospital and we took the Fire with us. The Fire let my wife read her web email while she was in the hospital which was very convenient. Back home I signed into my Amazon account and it immediately asked me if I wanted to continue reading my novel on the Fire. I clicked yes and finished the book. Very nice.<br />Later when the local weather was unstable I realized I could see the  radar from a local TV station's web radar so I opened Silk and sure enough it works very well. In fact I probably check the radar every day .<br />Every time I try a task it seems the Fire can do it.
We got this as a gift and are just getting to feel our way around the programming. We especially like being able to have multiple users with separate libraries. My husband's been enjoying using the video viewing aspect.
Very nice
I upgraded from an Amazon Fire HD 1st generation and was very happy with my decision. Love the goodreads integration and faster speed.
Once I got use to it being different from my first Kindle.  yes  love it
Great thanks again for everything and everyone
My only problem with it is the picture quality should be a little clearer
"Generally, a good tablet with a bright, scratch resistant screen.  Between the wife and kids, we have 3 now.  The kids end up using my Nexus almost as often as they do their own Fires.  The biggest complaints are (1) they freeze and have to be reset at least a couple times a week, (2) at least once a week, they will not turn on and have to be connected to the charger to respond even when mostly charged, (3) at least a few of the games they love from the Google Play store are not available through Amazon, (4) when they run low on space, the WiFi connection fails.  My wife, who uses it more often as a book reader and we browser, has far fewer issues.  Third party content compatibility seems to be its biggest nemesis."
Totally addicted.  Best $100 I've spent in a long time!
For an android tablet it hardly lets you do anything. Packed to the brim with DRM garbage. Even Apple products let you customize more then this piece of work. They force you to go through a proxy server meaning once and a while you will have to do a factory reset to get things working. There is no way to access the Play Store unless you want to root the system. If you mess up rooting it the entire thing is bricked and they charge $70 magical dollars to just reset it. It also heats like crazy even when doing the most simple things.If you want a netflix machine or a cheaper E-Reader then have go ahead an waste you money but if you are in the market for a good tablet good to somewhere else.
just trying to get use to it. It's not as easy ad the HD was
considering having my kindle grafted on as body part
My tablet is an extraordinary addition to my daily schedule.
"Just got it, seems ok, but heres the kicker:  IN NO WAY CAN YOU CHANGE THE WALL PAPER ON THIS THING. I paid extra for the \\""non-advertisements\\"" wall paper package, and lo and behold the thing gets here and you can't personalize it at all.  I called Amazon to express my displeasure with this and was on hold for too long. I mean, in ANY personal device there is a way to do this. It is the MOST SIMPLISTIC S*** that goes on a device and for some reason Amazon seems thinks its ok to not have this option included. Seriously considering sending it back immediately due to this inconvenience. NOT GOOD, AMAZON."
I am EXTREMELY disappointed with my purchase if the Kindle fire HD7.  I purchased 3 of these for my kids.  I have been trying for a week now to get it set up with movies and songs from our home MAC.  This product is NOT user friendly.  There is no setup guide that pops up when you plug it in.  I went online and downloaded the Android File Transfer app like i was supposed to and I'm unable to transfer them music and movie files from the app to the kindle.  I called customer service and was on the phone with them for an hour.  They were not helpful at all!  In the end they told me that MP3 and MP4 files aren't compatible with the Kindle Fire tablet.  This seems very odd to me!  I consider myself pretty savvy on the computer and haven't had any problems in the past but the set and navigation of these Kindle 7's are extremely difficult.  I'm very surprised by my experience with the kindle and with amazon's customer support.  I have been a HUGE fan of amazon for many years and shop on the site nearly everyday.  We use amazon prime and watch movies/shows through their site.  I assumed that the use of the kindles would be the same.  This was NOT the case.  I am now returning all 3 kindles and looking at IPAD mini's for the kids instead.
Lovin' it
I have alot more to learn about the device.How do I get an instruction manual?
Works just fine and fits perfectly!
Excellent product!
I've had several tablets in the past and this tablet is by far the easiest to operate from the moment I removed it from the package.
"both my kids have older 2013 kndle fire models.  my sons had charging issues from the beginng.  amazon sent a new charger that did not fix the problem,  they finally replaced the kindle with new.  my daughters kindle now two years old has had charging issues for a few months and eventually is dead and does nothing.  just got off phone with amazon and was told the warrenty period has passed and cant help.  she actually tried to sell me a new one right after she told me my 2 year old kindle was worthless.  i have officially lost faith in amazon and will not be purchasing through amazon any longer.  spend the extra money on an apple. its worth it."
loved the price of this item. I love the function of this device. Would definitely buy again in the future
"We are totally pleased with the product and the follow up service you provide, thank you so much..  Bryant dessem"
Still learning to use new Kindle. So far no gliches. Would like battery life to be longer.
Definitely love this version of Kindle
Works good
Bought this as a gift for my daughter's 8th birthday and she absolutely loves it...
"I bought this to replace my old kindle that cracked. I am not a fan of the on and off button's location. It is so tiny that it is hard to press. Also, the kindle gets hot fast and mine did not come with a power cord. :( It also seems to freeze on me every now and then. Not too impressed."
great product love it but does not last long
"This is my first tablet, and I couldn't be happier."
Wish I had never ordered it. The main reason was for the camera. Well from day one the battery would not hold a charge. So now I only use it to read if my old kindle is changing. Then today the &#34;buttons&#34; on the device quit working. So wish it worked like my first one. Don't know what I'll do if my original gives out.
Love this Kindle. Bought it for my grandson. Mostly for games. He can hardly put it down.
"This device is outstanding! I had an older version of this when they first came out, this one beats it hands-down! This is our 4th device to date, and they just keep getting better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Book-like size and reasonable weight- extremely portable.<br />- GREAT sound, especially with Amazon Prime movies!<br />- Fast processor, especially compared to previous versions.<br />- Great resolution.<br />- Text more readable than ever(indoor - see cons).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Tough to read in the sun - high gloss screen creates glare.<br /><br />Grab an anti-glare screen protector, and enjoy this impressive device!"
My son bought this for me for mothers day. I've been enjoying it ever since.
No complaints. Holds a charge a long time. Very handy and easy to use.
"The ads are annoying (supposedly you can pay Amazon extra money to get rid of them, basically it's the reason for the cheap price), and having Amazon's own app store instead of the real google play store borders on unacceptable for an android device. It looks like it's made well physically, and the OS is decent other than I'm not a fan of any company customizing android (it's ALWAYS better left alone). The dumbed-down interface is better than other companies attempts at that I've seen though.<br /><br />I haven't yet, but I should probably try install some of the apps that are NOT available in the Amazon app store (yes a lot of apps are missing). Supposedly it is possible to install directly from the APK file.<br /><br />It's annoying to get an email about an amazon purchase every time you install a FREE app, as it's basically like you are buying each app from Amazon for $0.00."
"I love my fire so far. It does most of the things that I need it for well. Watching movies is pleasant, and surfing the web matches most tablets. It isn't horribly fast when opening apps, but for the price I can't gripe. Graphics are marginal, but sound is great. I don't use the camera. I wish there was a home button on the front and hate the charging port being next to the power/feature button on the top. It makes it hard to use when charging and watching movies. Otherwise, its a great tablet. The 7&#34; size is perfect for carrying around, as it can tightly fit in a pocket yet is large enough to surf and type."
"works great, looks great!"
"In general, we are completely dissatisfied with the Kindle Fire HD 7.  We bought this to replace a Nexxus 7 2013 model which worked great until it completely stopped working.  The Kindle is not compatible with the Android system in the ways we use it the most.  We are unable to use it with Chromecast and does not upload Google Play services at all.  The games my daughter has downloaded all require a Wi-Fi connection to operate.  This defeats the purpose for us.  Most of the usage is for longer car rides and Wi-Fi is not available.  The configuration with Amazon shopping and the Amazon app store is sloppy compared to the standard Google interface.  I also cannot return or resell on Amazon as I bought it as part of a charitable auction.  On the positive side, it does seem built well and able to withstand some bumps.  It is also relatively inexpensive compared to others.  However, it isn't worth the money if it doesn't function the way you want to use it."
I love the clear display and all of the features it offers. The only thing I don't love is how hard it is to read in certain lights like at the beach.
What a great price for this powerful little tablet. The HD is amazing!!
Love it!
No ad version would have been better.
Freezes up about twice a week.  Closes out my internet page without permission.  Then I get a notice that tells me it can restore if I want.  Can't play my music while I am at work - my previous Kindle I could with no problems.  My other Kindle would show my what book I was reading on the home screen - this one does not.  I backed up a lot of my info from my other Kindle - maybe there is something I didn't do correctly.  But the freezing up and shutting down should not be affected by that.  The main reason for me purchasing this Kindle was for the expanded memory - but I miss my old Kindle.
I absolutely love this thing
No battery life
"I am on kindle unlimited but on the 7 inch kindle, I keep getting books that are not on kindle unlimited. I want to check my list of books before I go to read them. Is there anyway to do this?"
"I am so completely frustrated with this device. I have lost count of the times I have spoken with Kindle support, the number of factory resets I have done, the times I have deregistered, and unregistered my Fire.<br /><br />I have been sent two replacement devices since my original purchase. The same thing happens each time. My Fire worked wonderfully, initially. Then the update would automatically install. After that, the device would become almost useless. I have asked support if I could get a device without the update and was told that tech support could roll back the update. That has not happened yet.<br /><br />I purchased this for the increased storage, and the ability to use the collections feature. I have a large number of books. This device gets hot enough for me to be afraid to leave it on, but support keeps telling me they are reading a normal temperature. When I attempt to download a book, the first one downloads fine. The subsequent books don't show a progress bar, so you aren't aware if the book is downloading or not. The only way to tell is to check the carousel or tap on &#34;device&#34; and see if the book appears with the check in the lower right corner.<br /><br />It takes anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes for books to appear as downloaded most times. Going to the Cloud, and scrolling through my books will cause the entire device to freeze.<br /><br />Sometimes, the screen will start scrolling by itself. I haven't touched it or anything. I'm at my wits end. I have spent more time troubleshooting the device than I have using it.<br /><br />If you have an older Fire, keep it. At least until they can find out what is wrong with the update."
Why do some of my apps only work for a week or two? I have to reload several game apps every other week!
"This unit is actually for my wife. She loves it. However, the cover is terribly over priced for the plastic piece of crap that it is."
tyvm
Perfect fit and easy to hold.
LOVE this!!! I had a Kindle with a keyboard for years that finally gave out on me. I bought the Kindle Fire HD7 and had no idea how much I would love it!
"We purchased this in anticipation of a cross country road trip. I'm in the Navy, and we move every few years, but this will be the first cross country move with a child. We also purchased a case for it since toddlers tend to throw things around.. especially expensive ones. Having this will definitely help out with the ability to download and save sesame street videos. My son seems to enjoy it but after about 30 minutes or less he gets bored with it if there are other people around (which is probably a good thing). In the car, he has a longer attention span with the kindle, so I am hopeful for our move. I'll update after we move to see how effective the kindle was."
Love it!!!! This is my second one and I couldn't be happier with it.
Great delivery and product!
Nice useful tablet and reader.
"There is nothing I dotn like about this device!  I am disabled and much of my normal functioning is beginning to fail.  I love to read but had to give it up as I simply can no longer get books or hold them to read them.  I was trying to read them online on my laptop but I can no longer sit in one place or in a position long enough to read a book.  But I have begun to read once again thank to Kindle and Amazon prime.  I was gifted this HD7 as a surprise.  I do charity work as it is all I can do.  And someone who knows what I do and my situation secretly rewarded me.  she opened my world back up.  I listen to lots of music again.  I am really enjoying the challenging game apps on this device too.  I have read a couple of comparisons to the Ipad and how this device lacks in comparison but this device is not meant to put ipad out of business and it costs about 1/5 th the price.  Look at all it can do and with a super crisp and clear 7 inch screen.  WOW  I keep my medical appointments and notes for my medical providers right at my fingertips and super organized too.  I can surf the net and read the pages too.  I can hear this device so clearly and i leave it on all night playing music which helps me sleep.  It is a companion to me.  I am a shut in and rarely even see another human in person unless it is medically oriented and those can be 3 or 4 months in between.  I am once again connected to the world and much that it has to offer with this great device. It is by far the best electronic device I have ever had and I use to work in the technology field. ITs nto the fastest but, it is as fast as I need and as fast as you'll need to get it all done.  I even watch HD movies too.  Again, I cant say enough good about this device!!"
Enjoy it and I don't know what I did with out it!
It was a father's day gift from my wife and daughter. They made me open it as soon as it arrived. I AM SO GLAD THEY DID!!!!! I love everything about it.
Fire tablets just keep getting better at a decent price point.
I have had this fire about a week now. I'm pretty disgusted with it but already the typing has been slow. May be due to low battery. It also got stuck once on just a black screen. Other than that I really like it
Great little tablet for my daughter but needs more memory
"I had absolutely no problems with my FIre,  with the exception the battery died. Luckily it was less than 6 months old, so the dept store replaced it for me. I can't imagine a day without it ever again! The hardest part is keeping it out of the hands of my seven year old nephew,  who takes mine every chance he gets."
I am enjoying my new kindle
"My husband bought the 1st generation fire when they first came out. I thought I was in love then. I just recently got the fire hd 7 and I'm blown away. Not only does it have way more memory than my last one, the picture is absolutely amazing. They have really outdone themselves this time. Easy to use and durable. I had one problem with the first generation and it was just after the 1 year guarantee and they still took care of me. So far so beautiful on the hd version. I have always been an Amazon fan and their amazing customer service but anytime I have had a problem they have been helpful and always fixed my problem. I see where some people are mad about what they ended up getting. Did you get research this before you bought? To spend this amount of money you would think you would do some homework. If they had I'm sure they could have saved some time and money and gone elsewhere. But it would have been their loss. Keep up the great work putting out amazing products and I'm sure this won't be the last tablet I get from you!"
I love my kindle Fire HD 7! I've had a couple cheaper tablets but this is my favorite by far.
Still working on the technical aspects of this new machine. Hopefully it will serve me for what I have intentions of using it for. I need more instructions for downloading reading materials!
"We have 3. But too bad the devices freeze if we load movies onto it from our library. The device also doesn't perform well when a movie is loaded onto it. Some of the games cannot be played because of a video being on the device. I'm wondering if most of the 8gb is used for the device to be able to process content. In general, a good product."
awesomeness!
"Took a while to get used to it, but it is much better than the original kindle.  Easier to operate and much faster downloading information."
It is very nice for a smaller size tablet.
Only one problem with ir. The case I ordered with the Kindle didn't show up...When is it coming?
It's a very nice device.
Only ordered one book so far. Loved my old Kindle.  I am disappointed that &#34;Trigger&#34; is in a black screen with white letters. I can not read the story while sitting in by back yard in the sun. I was facing the sun so the Fire was in shadow but it was a mirror.<br />Can I change it to a white screen with black letters? Or is that specific to this one story?<br /><br />I do like that I can get email and look up different things on internet. Still learning about the Kindle Fire 7<br />Jean
"Love it. It came ready for me to use, I did not have to do anything. It is easy to figure out, Well the tutorial was simple and to the point. And now that I know how to use Firefly (it's like eyes and ears that identify objects and sounds and puts them in the correct files and shows you what programs you can use with them) , I can't wait to try it out. This is my first Kindle."
Bought this for my wife for her birthday. She's not really a &#34;gizmo&#34; (her term) person but she hasn't put it down since I gave it to her. Pretty much has replaced her antiquated netbook that I got her six years ago.
"This is my second fire,upgraded to he.  I love it"
Love the parental controls.
"Works smoothly, but child very quickly found out how to bypass parentals quickly and easily.  Trustedin the security, but was highly disappointed.  Had to return it for this reason."
"This would have been one star if it wasn't for the quality of the sound/speakers.  The screen of my first Fire HD cracked when my son dropped it and I bought this latest generation as a replacement.  I'm not sure if my first one was 1st or 2nd generation but it worked perfectly.  This newest generation is junk and I have nothing but problems with it.  I have the same games on it that were on my previous kindle and somehow this one, with the same amount of memory as my first, runs out of memory and I have to keep moving games back-and-forth between the device and the cloud.  It also crashes more times in a day than I can count.  This NEVER happened with my previous kindle Fire HD.  I guess I now know why Amazon keeps offering $40 off this version.  I think there will have to be some major software updates to get this working as well as my old kindle and I would NOT recommend this one for purchase."
"works fine.  Took some getting used to ... camera is VERY touchy and I've been getting more than one picture when I used it yesterday!  It takes beautiful, clear photos, though."
Very nice having color but would just as soon use my Kindle paperwhite.
"The Kindle HD 7 would be a nice tablet if Amazon installed a real Android system instead of the deliberately hobbled FireOS. FireOS is a version of Android that takes all the Google parts out and tries to redirect you to Amazon substitutes. Unfortunately, the Amazon versions are nowhere near as good. Use Google Apps? You're out of luck. Want something in the Play Store? Too bad. Want a webbrowser besides the hopelessly buggy Silk Browser? Good luck with that. You can sideload some apps if you are technically proficient, but for others, you are out of luck.  As for the children, Amazon's FreeTime is a terrible implementation of a good idea. The setup is designed for small children, so that you can limit screen time and keep them off the internet. While Amazon claims to have a &#34;Teen mode&#34;, this is the exact same FreeTime for six year olds, just with a different interface. You can't let your children use a web browser. You can't let your children use side loaded apps. (I really wanted my children to use MIT App Inventor, which isn't in the Amazon App Store.) Why? Because Amazon said so.  If you like Amazon and you want something well integrated into the Amazon world, then the Fire HD 7 is a nice tablet. If you want something for a preschooler, FreeTime works well. Otherwise, you'll be a lot happier with a real Android tablet.  Update: ***I LOVE the new Amazon Shop Tab. Now my 11 year old can know what birthday presents we bought her and what kind of condoms we use. Thanks, Amazon!***"
Can't go anywhere without it. Fits neatly in my purse.
"There were some technical difficulties with the first fire HD7 I go t ( it would not allow me to purchase music or videos). Amazon promptly replaced it with one that does.<br /><br />The sound and screen resolution are awesome on the fire HD 7 and it is fairly simple to use. This device takes fairly good pictures and holds its charge well.<br /><br /> It has really nice features when shopping on Amazon where you can filter and drag & drop a product for future comparison, review or purchase option.<br /><br />The book or kindle aspect of this tablet is also great. I am not a fan of clouds but this is well appreciated for storing my books.  This version also allows you to organize your books in collections. A book may be added to multiple  collections.<br /><br />What don't I like about it - reason for the 4 stars - I find the device to be very heavy and seems to heat up with extended use. This feels heavier than most paperbacks and certainly heavier than all my previous Android 7&#34; tablets, even though it is slimmer than some. This is  inconvenient when reading in &#34;my zones&#34; where use of the stand on my case may be impractical.  I have not figured out yet how to overcome the glare or reflection issues when reading in bright light outdoors situations (other that shading my device or adjusting the angle).<br /><br />Would I buy this device again?  Most definitely."
very nice product
I have the previous version and was waiting for it to go on sale.  I love that the power button is on the top versus on the back. The volume control is on the left side now to make room for the camera.  The screen seems smoother than the previous version.  It makes page turning a bit easier. For someone who reads as much as I do it's a great product for a great price.
"Best tablet ever, it's the only brand of tablet my family and I will ever use. And the Amazon customer support is outstanding!"
Exelent
Very easy to use. Nice screen image.
"so easy to use, long battery, durable, great size"
Great tablet!
YES I LOVE IT
"Bought to replace my kids Samsung tab that has battery issues, and was looking forward to being able to download Prime Video (I had planned on borrowing it for my frequent travel).  It does do a great job with managing Amazon items (books, videos, music, etc).  But...<br /><br />I am absolutely unhappy that I cannot change my wallpaper without having to download a 3rd party app, risking adware, or pay Amazon an additional fee to stop the advertisements every time I use the Kindle (a Kindle that I bought by the way..).  I'm not crazy about the look and feel of it, compared to typical Android tablets, but it is OK.  I'm still discovering the in's and out's of it, and may update my review at a later time.<br /><br />If you absolutely want the download feature for Prime video, then by all means buy this tab.  I will not purchase another one, and will stick to my non-Apple wanna-be Android tablets in the future."
I love my new kindle. I got one about 3 years ago and my new one far excideds my expectations. It's so much faster and easier to use.
super!!!!!!!!
"Like it very much,but shuts off after a few hours not like it says 8 hrs. Other wise it's good"
perfect
"just what I wanted, thanks so much. Received on time was a plus."
So many things to do with this pad. I love it.
have not used it much...need to spend time becoming familiar
"A fun new toy and work item, We are still getting to know each other!"
Great!
well worth the money
"So far it performs to my expectations, and has way more features than I will ever use in my lifetime.  I finally got my brain cells down to a manageable level, and now I don't have enough to master this technology.  I am sure that people now days, must have an electronic chromosome, which I lack.  I hope that someone gets a chuckle from my review."
For its size it is great.  Would like a flash drive port
Still learning how to use it.
"i can't get it to charge.  it was working fine and i was totally hooked,so needless to say i,m in a state of disappointment."
"I absolutely HATE HATE HATE this stupid piece of junk! I regret buying it. I wish I could set the darn thing on FIRE! I would have returned it if I weren't having health issues at that time that prohibited me from doing anything but getting through survival mode. Now I'm stuck with a useless device and out lots of money! This poorly designed device -- and Amazon's refusal to take it back -- makes me want to cancel my Amazon Prime membership and never come back just to spite them!<br /><br />-It's impossible to do anything on this device except Amazon-related applications. Not even the web browser is fully functional. I want to watch a simple video on the web browser, and I can't because I don't have Adobe Flash Player installed. Well, I can't get AFP working to save my life. It says it's installed, but it's not accessible or usable. The menu and layout of this thing is so confusing and non-sensical that I can find the AFP only half of the time. And again, it won't function with their web browser.<br /><br />-It is not intuitive ... unless you have the intuition of a psychotic rat who spends his days chasing a piece of cheese though a maze. Nothing is where you think it should be. It's not just me. Neither my husband or my daughter can figure it out.<br /><br />The only thing we've had success using on this device is FreeTime (the kid's app with some resemblance of parental controls -- but not very good controls, mind you). Oh, and guess what? FreeTime is NOT FREE. So, yay Amazon for creating a product that sucks, and requires further cost to continue to operate. Hats off to your business savvy.<br /><br />If you are looking for a handheld device that acts like a computer, get an Android. The Fire acts in no way like a computer/laptop.<br /><br />I will now return to fantasizing about running over this thing with my car, then lighting it on FIRE, and then throwing it in a pond. Yes, I'm being dramatic, but that's what 2 hours of frustration staring at this thing willdo to you!"
Love it. Actually it is more than I expected. I learn something new about it every day. Retired my Kindle because it was tired.
What I understand I like but it's all new to me.  It's my first tablet.  I still need a friend to explain how to download and use aps. I wish I could add more GB but there doesn't seem to be a way.
I just love it - it is even more than I expected!
"Great, my 2nd Fire."
"Way t0o little storage memory.  Amazon Kindle has what looks like a neat deal with the Freetime application/service to control how much time my kids have on the Kindle, and for each child to have their own login, and with access to all sorts of free games.  However, in a single day they filled up the tablet.  I read somewhere that this is like saying &#34;Here is an enormous Thankgiving feast for you, all you can eat, but only what you can fit onto this tiny plate.&#34;  How true.  This tablet also feels very sluggish compared my my iPhone 5.  Too bad about these two minuses because Freetime is the only good app/service that provide a multi-user experience on one device and good kid controls with that.  Nothing even close for iDevices. But that alone will not garner my praise for this device.  I'm very disappointed.  It is a good thing I won this as a door prize instead of paying for it.  I guess it may make a nice reader for some, but no good for a parent of children.  I think I'd rather just get each of my kids their own iPod, except I don't want to spend the money and they have too much screen time as it is."
"I am an avid reader and book hoarder. To cut down on the clutter of all my books I broke down and finally bought a tablet/kindle. I do not like it and wish I'd never bought it!  I can't read it outside, can't see the screen.  This in itself should have made me NOT buy.  Any movement with the tablet can move the screen and lose your place.  The battery life is pitiful.  Anyone who loves to read knows you may read for a while, stop and do something, come back to the book etc.  Battery life isn't as long as my reading capacity and it's frustrating. Another smaller point is I'm left handed and these devices are definitely right hand designed.  In all I don't think it's just this tablet and the problems make it too frustrating to enjoy.  Updating my review.  I dislike this tablet even more.  The rotating screen no longer works.  The battery life is even worse than I thought it would be.  I've had to have it reset by a tech.  And I ONLY USE IT TO READ!!!  I do not surf the internet, do Facebook, my personal e-mail, nothing but buy books from Amazon and try and read them.  This is so frustrating and one of the biggest disappointments of anything I've bought from Amazon.  Truly do not like."
Loved the size and the price!
"I'm very happy my kids convinced me this Kindle would be perfect for me. I love the way it works, how comfortable it is to hold and everything.g about it so far!! Haven't started up my computer much since it arrived. Thank you."
"It was delivered today, charged upon delivery, making it easier to become familiar with this sweet little tablet. Decided to spend the extra $20 for the 16 GB,  plus the extra cost for the up-grade GB was not prohibitive. As an avid iPad user, still love my iPad, I thought the Kindle would be a nice addition to be used strictly as an e-reader...I think I made a good choice with my funky pink Kindle HD 7...so far so good, color me happy."
Awesome!
I got it for my birthday! !!! It's easy to use and I love reading on it. I'm thinking about buying my grandson one.
"Luv it, no complaints"
This is my first time using or owning a kindle and I have found  it pretty user friendly. I bought one for my mom also and she seems to really enjoy it
It's OK. I don't see any difference between this model and the HD except more expensive. Not worth the price. Which I had waited and put that money toward the larger 8.9 tablet.
"At first my wife didn't want the kindle fire. But I bought it for her anyway, now she is so happy with it. She didn't think she would use it for anything other than reading, but now she watches tv shows in bed, checks email, and a lot more."
"Typing this review on my kindle fire. For the price, this tablet cannot be beat. It is a great product for consuming media, especially if you have an Amazon prime account. However, I wish there was a bit more in the app store. For instance, google products are missing. It would be nice to be able to put google maps on here. There are of course &#34;backdoor&#34; says of getting it on, but the functionality is not great."
"Extremely satisfied. I wanted a new tablet and the fire HD7 called my attention when the price was lowered to $99. I was willing to give it a try since it offered quad core and 7 inch screen with a custom Amazon Android OS (called Fire OS). I could not be more amazed. The tablet allows the installation of most popular android apps though Amazon's own app store. It not only has most of the android apps, but also allows the installation of other apps sources. I quickly figured out that I can install ES file manager app since it is on Amazon app store and navigate though the file system. I moved my phone apps to google drive and then shared on to the Fire HD7, as expected, they downloaded and installed without issues. I mostly needed this tablet to read internet, listen to internet radio, and watch movies, sling media.  As soon as I played the first movie, I was blown away by the speakers pristine audio and the display resolution. The only cons are the battery life and the lack of sd card slot. My main apps in use are: Pandora, iHeart radio, Sling Player, Tonido, MediaStreamer, Vidon Player and Xfinity. Again, audio is better than any other device I've owned."
Another Kindle Fire for our household and we have several versions. I purchased it to replace an original Fire that my 6 year old wore out and she loves it. It has all the great features of our Kindle Fires plus some new ones and is easy to navigate. One of the best features for us is this version has a microphone on the keyboard so we don't have to help her spell things to search for videos. The resolution is crystal clear and the cameras work great. That's it in a nutshell as you can review the technical aspects above. Everyone in my household has a Kindle Fire and we all love this version.
"This 7&#34;Kindle Fire is so much better the = symble is no problem to exit out of an app with the slide up selection foe getting out of an application Pocket Pond 2 for example the = simble is right where the selection to open the pond, I believe his should be the same for The Kindle fire HD 8.9 device it's almost impossible to exit with both open pond and exit app in the same location , the PP2 app has a very large symbol to open a pond  the slide up selection would be a great improvement for the 8.9 &#34; device  as expensive as the device is this should be fixed and updates sent to all owning a Kindle fire HD 8.9&#34;.  What I am saying is if the smaller screen device which is cheaper already had the slide up selection available it should be on all Kindle devices."
I love my new kindle.
"Bought this for our 5 year old daughter.  She loves it-watches shows, plays games and the screen is just the right size!  We are Ipad and droid users, so we are just getting use to the apps that are available for it-seems to be limited more so than our other devices (e.g., we are looking for Poptropica-not available for the Kindle right now that we can find).  But overall, great device and battery lasts long."
I love this kindle fire it has a nice display and it's a good size.for.what I need as well as a nice design.
It did not come with case or and screen protector or any of the other items I just ordered. Was it supposed to?
"Decent price when on sale, simply don't like the limited android operating system and restrictions from Google play. Would buy a non-restricted brand such as Samsung next time and not one that tries to control you for their sole benefit as the kindle does."
Good read  enjoyed
"Make sure you search the Internet for &#34;Kindle powers off by itself&#34; before you buy one. Mine will just shut off for no reason. I cannot power it on without the charger plugged in.  This will happen when there is 90% power. You will find a lot on the net with the same problem. None could be fixed. Mine was past warranty so I aS out of luck. Other had replacements and the same problem. I have no choice but to get anther one. I have about $400 of book, movies and apps. If I could redo I would not buy it."
"I have several Kindles from various generations and different sizes, so I have reference point in reviewing this particular model from a non-tech person's perspective. In summary, this is a very nice Kindle Fire to buy for your kid and for yourself if you are a casual user who needs simple video playbacks and do some light browsing of the internet.<br /><br />This Kindle has front and rear cameras plus microphone function allowing you to take videos and pictures. However the quality is basic with only 2 Mega pixels. The processor does feel medium speed for today's standards but not too slow with its quad-core 1.5 GHz. There is a Bluetooth function and the sound quality is also quite good. The screen is not as good as the HDX line but quite acceptable.<br /><br />The RAM included is only 1GB plus 8GB storage, so I wish it was more. However, considering all the features this has and is currently selling at under a hundred dollars, I think it is a fine purchase for light users and little kids. The overall look is more squarish than many of its competitors but I like it."
"Don't get me wrong--I love my Kindle. I bought my second fire hd7 in November. It quit last week. Amazon told me it would send me a NEW replacement. They LIED.They sent me a refurbished one. I called customer service (joke) and was told they would not send me a new Kindle if it was over 30 days old. So they don't think their devices are good for more than 30 days ????  Even though it is still under warranty, they will not replace your device with a new one. I can not believe a company as big as Amazon with a reputation for service would condone such poor customer relations. I will never buy an electronic device from this company again. They offered me a $20 gift card like that would fix everything.I told the rep that the whole point here is they LIED."
"Still learning all there is to my new Fire HD7, but it has been a fun experience. Just wish it had some written instructions with it for the older folks like me that are not used to all the new 'toys'."
"I gave this to my grandson last month for his birthday.<br />He really loves playing games and reading on the kindle.<br />The kindle battery starts going down as soon as you unplug it from the charger.<br />I mean right away, withing an hour without eve using it, the battery is down from 100 percent to about 80 percent.<br />Perhaps this is because they shipped the kindle to me in with server packages of powerade.<br />I will be contacting Amazon"
"This was my 3rd Kindle, bought it for my husband so he'll leave my Kindle alone."
Better than expected.
"Excellent , I used it more than my daughter, Thank you"
"The Kindle Fire 7&quot; HD is a great tablet, with a nice display that renders colors accurately, is sharp and clear, easy on your eyes, and, in my opinion, is far better than the grossly overpriced iPad. You get far more bang for the buck purchasing any Kindle Fire tablet, but especially so with this model. The one, small, weakness is its radio, which is a little on the weak side, and sometimes loses the WiFi connection, but will usually quickly rediscover it, and you're on your way again. Amazon has it right with the Kindle ecosystem, and their awesome selection of apps, books, videos, movies, music, and accessories. The icing on the cake is Amazon's cloud. Treat yourself, a loved one, friend, or acquaintance with a new Kindle Fire!"
"It's easy to navigate works well and fast.<br />missing out on the personalization department<br />but that's not the inportant part, so over all pretty good"
This little device is awesome! Setup was a breeze and the pictures are crystal clear. I've already talked 1 friend into purchasing one and hepled her get it set up! I definitely reccomend this product
The Kindle fire picture quality is excellent and the second is fantastic especially with the way it let you down load movie's . Would highly recommend.
Love it! Will be great tablet when I want something light to hold rather than my iPad. Could have saved a lot of $ had this been available when I purchased the iPad. Learning how to navigate now as I just received it yesterday.
I love it
I am very pleased with this item.
Love the tablet.
"I had an original Kindle Fire which stopped working properly after 2 years.  After several days on tech support with Kindle, my first frustrating experience with Amazon tech support, I finally decided to upgrade to an HD.  I received it 3 weeks ago after waiting a very long time it to arrive and I've had problems with it since day 1.  I just spent another couple of hours on tech support trying to have it fixed and it was just not working right.  They are replacing it for me but the waiting period for delivery is about 3 months.  Have to post how disappointed I am.  I've been an avid Amazon customer for many years. This is really the first bad experience I've had but a very frustrating one."
"Disappointing and nowhere near as good as my last, a Kindle Fire. I thought I was buying a tablet, but this is just a badly organized, shoddily made ( Vietnam? Republic of Elbona? Isle of Dogs?) piece of junk no where near the prce"
I liked the fire hd so well that I bought one for my wife.
"I've been using this kindle for maybe a month or two now and so far, not the biggest fan. I'm still deciding whether or not to keep it and my only reason to is because the kindle is so cheap. But you definitely get what you pay for.<br /><br />The kindle feels kind of boxy and large compared with an older model Samsung Tab (10-in) I had. It is really light however, but then feels weird because of how thick and boxy it is. I'd almost rather a heavier tablet if it's that big to feel like it's that size for a reason or why couldn't they slim it down if there's hardly anything in it?<br /><br />The apps are extremely limited. I had the impression you could get most apps as an android or apple, but you can't even change the browser. You're stuck with Silk and Bing as your search engine. Really? That right there is a HUGE turn off. So far anything else I've looked for common to my work iPhone and personal Android, haven't been able to find. Except Netflix, so I guess that's a plus? It was even difficult figuring out how to use Audiobooks on it, which is an Amazon company. While I'm not the brightest by any means, I do work in I.T. and have pretty intuitive feel for getting software, applications, and hardware to work. But it took me far too long to get some of my Audiobooks purchases to play.<br /><br />I don't like that all the apps are ribboned in the middle to swype through and organize themselves acording to last-opened. I'd rather a grid or something I can customize for which apps I want to use and where they go on the screen. For the first week, I couldn't even figure out how to browse the internet because I didn't recognize the Silk browser icon.<br /><br />Overall it's just really clunky, both physically and the interface; and I find myself grabbing my boyfriend's iPad over this and I really hate Apple products. So that tells me that this is worse."
"I bought the 6&#34; Fire in October and when I saw the 7&#34; went down to 99.00, I decided to upgrade and so glad that I did. That one inch more screen you get makes watching videos so much nicer than on the 6&#34;. I love my new (and bigger) Fire!"
Great item.  Thoroughly enjoying it.
"Fast delivery, great product. Great for kids and adults. We are using it as a family tablet and for road trips in the car to watch vidoes and read!"
Easy to set up and navigate. Seems to do everything an iPad does at a much better price.
"I am very dissappointed with the quality of the pictures, My original fire took amazing pictures and the quality when printed did not change this one is not even close"
"Not sure what the deal is. This is my 3rd Kindle and while the functionality is great - this thing takes FOREVER to charge. It can take 24 hours to get a full charge and if the battery goes low during use, it's not enough to just plug it in. It frequently dies while plugged in during use if the battery was low &#60;15% to start. The battery dies faster than previous models I've had - just a bummer overall. I guess you get what you pay for."
"I love reading books on it. Books are cheaper. Can play games do puzzles, check e-mail during commercials. Just a fine little gadget to have around. My grandson loves it also."
"I just received it and have not yet got to play around with very much yet, but it is much nicer than than my older KINDLE.  Finding items and doing from a written text in a book to a cross reference and then back is a lot easier."
It's just what I wanted.
ITS NICE I CANT WAIT 2 START USING IT THANX ALOT
"I am very pleased with my Fire HD7.  It performs all of the functions that I was hoping. It is fast and easy to use. I especially enjoy being able to take pictures with it and see them on my Fire TV as well as carry them on the tablet, or store them in the cloud. It is very handy for that function as well as many others."
"I am really enjoying this kindle as an upgrade to the one I had before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that though it seems to charge faster than my other kindle, I feel it loses its charge faster. There is no orange light to charge so I am hoping I will never have to jiggle it and wiggle it to charge right as I did the others I owned!"
I am loving the Fire HD7.  Everything is very clear and fast.
"wonderful, fast and easy"
I really am enjoying my kindle fire. You can do so much with it.
Love it. Does everything and more!!
I am so very happy with my Fire. It does everything I wanted to do.
"It is easy to set up has a good picture, very clear, has everything you need, play games, read books, watch movies, I couldn't ask for anything any better, it lights up so you can see it in the dark, I am very please with my purchase."
GREAT
Works great.
Awesome
Works just as advertised. I love it. Gave my old one to my brother. He loves it
"I love this Fire tablet. The upgrades from my previous one are really awesome. However, it locks up on me often. I've tried resetting it several times and I still have issues."
love it!
Love it! Easy to use!
love it
"The tablet is super but it seems as though its primary purpose is to get you to log into Amazon.com and buy something! I don't mind using Amazon among other sites to shop but I really hate that it is in your face all the time. As far as the tablet is concerned I have been pleased with it. It has a fantastic screen, for its size,  and the sound is surprisingly good, again for its size."
"I love my kindle, but within time there are battery issues that does not allow you to use it properly. Lost my interest in amazon products. This problem started after the 1 year guarantee; and their solution was to offer me a discount of $1.50 dollar in upgrading my device. Maybe, spending a little bit more in another high end tablet is wise."
Very happy with the product
This was my mothers day gift from my daughter in Michigan.  I absolutely love it!
I love my new Kindle but do not like the cover I ordered for it. It does not support the Kindle to stand and to turn
I upgraded to this model from the original Kindle Fire and I absolutely LOVE this Fire HD.  It has all the same features as the original with alot of improvements added to it besides going HD.
I love this Kindle.  Going to save my pennies to buy the larger one.  Picture quality and sound is great.  I have no complaints for the price---excellent bargain!
Love it!  It does everything I wanted and more!
I love my new Kindle. It has things on it that I have yet to explore but I love the was it operates and all  the things it has to offer.
Although I am still learning to use my  Fire HD 7 I love it !!
Purchased as a gift for someone.
"OK,..as so many others have stated. Skype falls short . It just plain down sucks!  One major reason I purchased this was so that my son could Skype..along with the down loadable reader. Skype was installed and it did not open once. It would just crash. What s piece of  @#**! So item was returned and an Ipad was purchased in return. enough said."
Battery life is much shorter than previous Kindles
It's a toy!  Battery drains even when turned off.  Good for shopping on Amazon.
I wish it had a place to upload a bigger sd card
Just happened to check the deal of the day and wow. Had to get me one and I don't regret it. Still getting use to operating it.  Now I don't use my cell phone so much and logging into a computer takes too long so this is just right. Just wish it indicated a site was safe or not.
I just opened it and I found out that I need to log into amazon to get the instructions.<br />it is not intuitive.  It is a New operating system to learn.
I have the Kindle Fire and it has the Mayday feature I returned this product and bought the same one I bought in 2013
Really good tablet for kids really durable
This product was much better than I had expected. I also own an IPAD (and a macbook and iPod) so I am kind of apple obsessed. I was really pleasantly pleased with the quality of this product especially for the price. At under one hundred dollar it IS a steal. The quality is clear and good. It has BOTH front and rear cameras which my son and i use a lot because we love to be silly and take cute pictures. And he is obsessed with watching Netflix on it. It is really lightweight which I also like but not so light that it is overly fragile. I am totally comfortable with my son using it. Perhaps my favorite thing about it is that it comes in so many colors unlike the IPAD. I got the pink because well thats my favorite color and then maybe my husband won't &#34;steal it&#34; (wishful thinking lol) The size is also really good for viewing books and is pretty much big enough to do anything you would want to do on it. I would highly recommend this product over the IPAD. You can save so much money without compromising anything.
"I have had a 16 gb kindle fire hd (2nd generation) for about two years and I LOVE it but the battery was getting drained too quick and it was getting really slow at response times. So, I ordered the new 4th generation kindle fire hd but 8 gb. I have never used up all my 16gb on the other kindle so I thought I would be fine. WRONG! I started getting apps and after about 8 I went to look at the storage. It said I had less than 1gb remaining! I did the math and my total storage on the kindle is only about 5gb! My sd card in my camera has hold more data than 5 gb. I am so not impressed with this kindle. Also, battery life is almost as bad as my 2 yr old kindle. I fully charged the thing and after 3 hours it was at 20% It takes longer to charge this thing than it does to use up the battery. Other things I disliked was that the screen leaves smear marks easier and it glares more. I thought that Amazon would make improvements to the kindle, not make it worse. Also, the sound quality is not as good as the second generation and the forward facing camera is not installed properly. You have to hold the the kindle way over to the left to even get a selfie. If I never had another kindle I would most likely be impressed because it is better than those $99 RCA tablets. But actually owning a good quality kindle the past few years has caused me to expect at least equal quality."
Love the unit.  Hate the fact that I paid $50 more just the week before.
I love it!
"I purchased this for granddaughter's birthday.  She loves it.  I bought another of the same in black for myself.  I love it.  She likes to play games, listen to music and read.  I like to play games and listen to books.  Kindle makes it very easy and enjoyable to do any of those things."
"Awesome tablet. I was worried that it would lag or slow down after a while, but nope, it has stayed working fast and reliable for quite a bit now. I let my dad use it for facebook and other apps and it is easy to learn how to navigate with this tablet. It also has a pretty fast boot up speed and fast internet connection."
Wife uses it all the time great purchase
Like it!
Works great I love it!
as described
I am still learning how to use it
"Tried an early gen Kindle and an iPad, the 7&#34; Kindle Fire provides the best reading experience yet."
I bought this to replace an older kindle I have had for quite some time. I have to admit the HD 7 is effing awesome! It does absolutely everything my iPad does and more and at a fraction of the cost ($99). Coupled with my Prime membership it is definitely an iPad mini killer.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
"It's missing the Google Play store - The Amazon App store barely any decent apps that I want (So much so, that I need to side load almost everything)<br />It meets the advertised battery life if you turn down the volume and have the brightness at minimum. Not so ideal.<br />It lacks basic customisation features such as selecting lock screen image, and wallpaper images.<br /><br />While I thought 8 GB was enough when I got it, but I wish you could use SD cards or similar with it to show off photos, etc.<br />Oh well.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good tablet, but it has crippling flaws."
"Love it even more than the original Kindle Fire.  Display is spectacular, battery life is much improved.  Still learning all the new features."
"this was a mothers day gift and I just love it because I don't just read books on it I can check my E-mail, facebook and go on the internet shopping."
"Defective design. I've had to have it replaced twice in a row now through the warranty for malfunctioning, after hours of tech support that achieved nothing but browbeating. No, my warranty isn't expired.   My second defective one was offered to be replaced with yet another one today, and I turned it down. How long will it be before this one croaks too? The one it's replacing never worked right. I can't trust these devices.  For such a hobbled device, slave to the limitations of what it is, but no access to purchase  any of the Amazon video content, book memberships, or Prime benefits because my account is Canadian, you can bet that I am not going to purchase another Kindle again."
"It has met all of my expectations.  Initially, I was going to purchase an IPAD Air but my son told me to shop around and I am thrilled with the product as well as the $200.00 in savings."
Love it
"Same as Fire TV stick. It is not working with any movie, music or application as long as you are outside USA. only books are accessible."
It's my first kindle and I love it. It's so easy to use and everything is right at your fingertips. Plus everything you have on the device is automatically backed up to the cloud. I highly recommend this if you want something easy and fun.
"Alright, I just got done with a long chat room conversation with some amazon &#34;help&#34;. I say &#34;help&#34; because it took 5 people to answer my question. My question was, &#34;Can I update apps in the freetime profile that are not on the parental profile&#34;. Short and simple, the answer is, No.<br /><br />We got the kindle for our son so that he could have a smart device but we would be able to monitor it and restrict his usage of it. I really like the timing profile and being able set time limits for how long and when he can play during the weekdays/weekends.<br /><br />But as time has worn on, we ran into issues. First, my son came to me one day saying that he wanted new apps. I obliged only to find that the kindle was out of memory. I was confused because he only had like 15 apps or so on his profile. As a matter of clarification, he is the only one that uses the kindle. After looking into it further, I noticed, THERE WERE TWO COPIES OF EVERY APP ON THE KINDLE! In order to create a freetime profile, you have to have a parental profile. You can only browse the appstore on the parental profile. When you find an app to download to add to the freetime profile, you click download and it downloads. What it also does is it uploads itself to the &#34;amazon cloud&#34;. This is where all your app purchases are kept in case you ever need to download them again easily. But here is the funny part. In order to add the new app to the freetime profile you have to download it from the amazon cloud. Therefore, the app that was just downloaded into the parental profile was for nothing. It has no purpose except to take up space.... At least this is what I thought until today.<br /><br />Prior to today, in order to clear out space so that my son could have more apps on his fire I deleted all the apps from the parental profile. This enabled us to get more then the 15 or so apps that he currently had. Granted, his kindle is only 8 gigs, but the only other option in memory is16 gigs which really isn't much more. Anyways, so today, I get a call from my wife telling me that one of his apps wasn't working and it was telling them that it had to be updated before it worked. They couldn't figure it out so they had to wait until I got home to figure it out.<br /><br />First thing I did was go to the freetime profile and check to see if there was any update apps option: None.<br /><br />Second thing, go to parental profile and check to see if I could update freetime profile apps from there: Nope.<br /><br />Third, contacted amazon chat help to try and figure out why I can't update the app that is in the freetime profile. It took about a half hour to get a straight answer. Only in the parental profile are the apps automatically updated. In order to update the apps in the freetime profile, you have to have the app already in the parental profile (which will automatically update itself). Then with that updated version you go into the freetime settings and remove, then readd the app that needs to be updated. If you have 5 apps that need to be updated, you have to unselect them all, then reselect them all to readd them to the freetime profile. After doing this, you have to go back into the freetime profile and redownload all the apps from the cloud. Along with this, any in app downloads need to be redownloaded as well. Some apps these days have over 500 megs of in app downloads after the initial app download.<br /><br />So when it all comes down to it, the kindle doesn't have enough space, the freetime at first glance looks great, but it has a ton of flaws, and the double app thing really bothers me. When it comes down to it, unless they do some serious software changes, my confidence in using their app is shattered. Time to look into other devices."
So far so good
Love it
Don't waste your time. It's a good product but your locked into Amazon apps and amazon's obnoxious marketing strategy. Amazon wish list: I wish I could use a You tube app and not have to search with the horrible Amazon Silk browsers for You tube so I can watch kittens hanging by one claw from a curtain.  And Amazon prime video lets you watch for pay what you can see on Hulu for free.
Was shipped on time and without any problems.
"I used to think the generic products were just as good, but when I bought this at a discount I realized I was wrong. No hangups or crashing for no reason. Love the Kindle and won't be buying those 'generic' ones again."
Love the tablet. Use this now instead of net book.
"As a devoted Apple user, I also love this Kindle. It was affordable and is easy to use. Good amount of storage for the price. Have used it mainly for reading e-books and streaming Netflix. I bought another one for my husband. They also go on sale from time-to-time. Bought mine for $99.00. Cannot beat that price for such a great product. Recommended!"
"I have a Gen 2 that I love and still use, but I bought this one because the price was right and I wanted another Kindle Fire HD regardless. I love it! It will take me awhile to download all of my music and apps so that it mirrors my Kindle Fire HD Generation 2 but I knew that from the get go. Amazon makes sure that everything I own is in the Cloud and I can download it on my newest device at my leisure. I now own 5 Amazon devices (Fire TV, Fire TV stick, Kindle Fire HD, Amazon Echo, and the 4th Gen Fire HD 7) and they all work together to make my Prime account worth the subscription. Thank you Amazon for your innovation!"
"Love my new kindle fire. Even better than my old one. I tried a tablet ,but it was too slow. Returned it, went back to Kindles. So glad I did."
This purchase was gift. I have this Kindle and thought it would be a great gift for someone who is housebound.  She enjoys it immensely.
Bought this kindle HD 7.7&#34;  for my daughter's tenth birthday. She loves it and uses it all day long. She likes it much better than her previous 7&#34; Visual Land tablet. I did buy the RooCase protective cover as well. It is wonderful! she navigates through it easily and has downloaded several free games and books without assistance from me. It comes pre programmed with the buyers email address so be aware of that and take the appropriate steps to monitor and protect your youngsters from Internet dangers. It is a great summer device to keep her busy and engaged.  I highly recommend it.
"I really love this...it is heavier than my old kindle, but the screen is much clearer. I still have along way to go in learning how to do everything on it, but I know I will enjoy the journey."
Doesn't stay charged and when i shut netflix down and turns itself back on.
"Everything about this was just as we expected. My only issue is with Amazon, and leaving your packages outside of your house, with a box clearly labeled as an Amazon item, which I'm sure a lot of people know probably has something expensive and fun inside. our kids currently had kindle fires, & I like how the HD comes with more current apps, and abilities."
I do everything on my tablet!
My children purchased this for Mother's Day. A week later it would not start up so I called Amazon and they sent me a new one.  Love my kindle! It makes my life so portable!!
Perfect for my three yr old and myself!!
I love it! It is so easy to use and navigate.
Great product...couldn't be happier
Love love love it
"Perfect. Fell from the top of my bunk bed and was bashed around as it fell and not even a scratch.<br />Easy to use and is very fast, better than my iPod."
Really like the smaller size.
I love it and wish I'd have gotten one long ago.
"like the size and clarity of the Fire HD 7. Also the stand is great to use while I am sitting down. Just ordered one for Hubby, for Father's Day"
"Great item, bought them for gifts and were well appreciated."
does everything we thought it would do. arrived in perfect condition. good vendor.
"I have an iPhone but this is my main device for home use. Great sound,  good screen, good hold design and fantastic software."
Perfect!
I like the tablet. It is easy to use. The price was right.<br /><br />My one disappointment has to do with the (in)ability to download movies and play them back later. My home internet service has a data limitation which prevents me from streaming movies at home using my Prime account. When I read about and ordered the HD 7 I thought I would be able to download a movie at another location and use the Fire to play it back at home on my TV. That seems to be impossible or else difficult to accomplish.
"Better than iPad, AirMac, all similar Apple products at a fraction of the price.  My iPad needed servicing almost a dozen times in 4 years.  The Fire hasn't given me the slightest problem in the year I have had it.  Even if the Apple counterpart never broke and was free, I would prefer the Fire 7.  Best product of this type in existence."
Received it as a gift.....LOVE it!
"Heavy, uses battery quickly. But overall, enjoying it."
It does what is billed to do at half the price (and then some); no interruptions like a smartphone; portable with Skype.
perfect for my needs
I won this and I just love it.. I was to cheap to purchase one on my own so I am grateful I won one
Very good
Exceeded my expectations
"Not really what I expected.  I thought that it would be an improvement over the last generation.  However, I reverted by to my old Kindle.  It works better and the battery last much loner.  I only get through about half  book before having to recharge.  Once you download a couple of games you are depleting you MB.  For the money a big disappointment."
This is my third kindle upgrade.  Love the camera and ease in posting on social media.
I am pleased with it and recommended it to my daughter who was quoted a price of $119.00 and I paid $139.00..not quite fair..and she is ordering today..I feel I should get some rebate..thank you
"I love the portability and ease of use -- as well as the gorgeous quality -- of my new 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.  I'm able to keep up with email, follow facebook, stay organized, manage my reading, and have fun with creative and colorful games -- all with one handy device."
"Very disappointed in the deceptive advertising. Bought as a gift. But the 8GB is not really for your use. You only get 4.5 GB. What's the point then?<br />Gift recipient was happy for gift but finds the 4.5 GB not really usable. So this will probably be returned.<br />This is a replacement for my previous kindle fire which has a defective charge port so can no longer be charged. Amazon was less than helpful with that item. I don't expect to get something for nothing, but am disappointed with their customer service.  I paid a lot more for my first kindle fire and it is unusable 3 years later."
"Great price and easy to use.  Nice that it loads up my apps, books, movies and music without much effort."
Love the simplicity and speed!! Great gift for this 61 yr old girl! Definitely reading more now!
"It takes the worst pictures, cant even make out what the picture is. Worst pictures off all in the whole world!!!! No wallpaper , every time you turn it on your looking at something you dont know anything about, Id rather have my own picture there, and if I choose to check out books its my choice and time."
We got it for our daughter and she loves it
Purchased as a gift for my 12 year old granddaughter. She loves it!
"I needed to replace my original Kindle Fire because the charging portal became nearly unusable. I had hoped that Amazon would have changed the style of that portal, as it seemed to me to be rather vulnerable to misuse. That not being the case, I will try to handle it as gently as possible and hope for the best."
This is my 3rd kindle. Love the color but I still prefer the previous style. The functionality is superb and picture crystal clear
"I love my kindle. I switched a while back from Barnes and noble nook and have been ecstatic with the switch. My only qualm about it is the camera. I'm glad this version has both forward and rear facing option however I almost never get a good quality pic with this thing. I'm not sure it's really a necessary product feature, why not ditch the camera and charge a little less for the product. Most folks have cell phone cameras anyway right"
Complacated
Replaced original Kindle fire had no issues with getting my old apps to transfer over.
Love it!!!
Image on the screen is crystal clear - just beautiful.  Still learning about all that I can do with it.  Haven't started reading on the Fire yet since my Kindle e-reader is still in great shape.
I love it my day at work goes so much faster listening to my books
I absolutely love my Kindle Fire HD. I upgraded because I needed more space for books and apps and was able to double it for just a few dollars more than I paid for the original version.
best bang for buck out there
great investment
"Really, really like this! My first Kindle was a paperwhite, and I really like it, still, cause you can read in bright sun BUT, you can watch Netflix @ nite, in bed with the Fire HD 7; how lazy is that??!!"
"bought for my daughter as a b day gift. she / we are so happy with this. I had bought similar sized tablet for almost same money at christmas from a different company, and it broke in 3 months. just out of warranty. we have had this one from Amazon for almost 2 months, and it is great, no lagging, nada!!! recommend to any one, easy to use, just didnt like the one click buy option that is the default, as my 8 year old knows no better...but you can disable that feature, although I had to call amazon on the phone to figure that part out. over all, yes, it is a buy."
love it
I enjoy the versatility of the Kindle fire but the battery life is a lot shorter than my regular Kindle.
wish it was still $99. works well and quick.
I didn't buy it
Gift for my husband.  He loves having his own tablet that the kids aren't using.
I am really enjoying my Kindle Fire.  I love to read and can read in the dark because the screen lights up.  i am enjoying everything about it. I put music and games on it and enjoy reading my local paper on it!  Glad I purchased it when I did!
Like it very much. Works very well. I was disappointed to see it go on sale less than a week after I ordered this one.
Wonderful! Easy to use.
"BEWARE! I just made a purchase at a store, using my loyalty card, then an hour later I get an ad on my new Kindle for the exact same product I had just purchased. I'm not a paranoid conspiracy theorist and this may be coincidence, but I doubt it. This seems to be nothing more than an invasion of my privacy. I accept and expect Amazon to track my purchases made through Amazon, but NOT the ones made through a convenient store or any other non Amazon online transaction. If this is their business model, I'll not use Amazon anymore, just as I don't use FaceBook, who's business model is to learn as much of your personal information as they can and then sell it.  The touchscreen isn't very sensitive and when typing there is a long delay between typing a symbol  and the symbol appearing on the screen. Were I to redo the purchase I would definitely have gone with one that has cellular capabilities and not just wifi, particularly since I live on Hawaii Island and wifi is not nearly as available as in a place such as Seattle or the Bay Area. Battery life is short and I have had troubles with the A/C charger. On the plus side, the picture is great and the sound is good. The price is definitely a plus."
"Love,love,love it!!!  Very happy with with all the features! Is everything that I was looking for in a tablet."
My wife loves the Kindle.
"This is a very good value tablet. It is sometimes on sale for $99, and that is a steal for this tablet. It's great for watching movies, reading books, internet browsing, and playing games. It's lightweight and responsive and has intuitive controls. Setup was very easy.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this tablet is that WiFi seems to drain the battery unreasonably fast. This was also a problem on the previous generation. I sometimes just switch it to airplane mode just so the battery will last longer. That's a bit annoying.<br /><br />Even so, I highly recommend this tablet."
Perfect
"I don't usually write reviews for these kind of products, but since this was a pretty important one I suppose I'll give it a shot. First of all, the most important thing for me was that it do the things I will use it for and do them well. I mostly use it as an e-Reader, and in my opinion Kindle is the best brand for that on the market. The print is just the right size, and the backlighting is excellent in any environment. I also haven't noticed any glare. As for the apps, I don't use many but the ones I have installed work very well and don't take up too much space. In terms of figuring out how to use the device, there isn't much of a learning curve because there are onscreen instructions that walk you through setting it up. I also like the non-invasive notification system. Wi-Fi works great; haven't had any problems with that. The only things that I could possibly find fault with are the storage size and battery life. One thing I anticipate using this the device a lot for is watching movies on Amazon Prime. I prefer HD, but the storage capacity (after taking system files and installed apps, etc. into account) is only enough for one HD movie, maybe two or three SD. It sucks, but this means I'll probably just opt to stream the titles I rent/buy when watching them on my Kindle Fire. As far as battery life is concerned, it's not bad by any means, but it doesn't last nearly as long as advertised. I suppose this is normal, but maybe they should put an estimate for people who use things like this more than infrequently. Still, when just using the e-reading function it lasts quite a long time. If I had to guess, I probably got 4-5 hours out of it before having to charge it. Bottom line: I am satisfied with my purchase. However, since I don't make purchases like this that often, if given the opportunity to get another one I would most likely go with the HDX. For those who aren't looking for something too heavy duty as far as a tablet goes but still with a wide range of functionality, you could do far worse than the Kindle Fire HD7.tionality, you could do far worse than the Kindle Fire HD7."
Just ok. Got it as a retirement gift and was very displeased that there were adds on the lock screen... like... seriously?
"We had the first generation of the Fire HD 7-inch tablet. This one is so much better... faster... built better. My daughter has dropped it a few times and it takes a beating without any issues. I use it mostly to surf the web, read articles through Flipboard and list to music (through bluetooth speakers)."
"User friendly, easy to read, good sound quality, and compact. A perfect companion for entertainment and staying informed on news events."
only draw back is i wish it was a little lighter. Wrist hurts after reading for a while.
It doesn't have Instagram or Snapchat and some games that you can get on an android or apple store u can't get in the amazon store
The Kindle has lived up to my expectations... am enjoying it
"Purchased this for my wife.  She loves it, however, I don't get to touch it."
I love this Fire HD. I bought it as a gift and am now considering purchasing another one in the near future.
"great tablet, amazing display compared to my old fire tablet, double the memory too!!"
"A great little tablet, easier to carry around than my iPad & gives me the opportunity to play my Amazon music collection, converse with the Amazon Fire Stick & communicate with the Amazon Echo. While it won’t anytime soon, replace an iPad, it’s a great adjunct & helps me to integrate with other Amazon products that I own."
I bought this for my young grandson and he loves having his very own tablet.
Very nice. Quick delivery
Awesome!!!! Love it!!!!!😊
"I cannot believe how wonderful this device is. Coming from someone who SWORE they would NEVER( hmmm...never say never) utilize this format. I am an avid reader fro both pleasure and my job. I always said I need the &#34;feel&#34; of a book and this would never work for me. My daughter, an English teacher purchased this for Mothers Day and said,&#34;Just try it.&#34; Well, needless to say , I love it. The feature whereby you can get instant vocabulary or concept feedback is awesome!! I find myself reading even more!!! No need to pile cumbersome books,. or donate the BIG pile of books I started but did not like. With a tap I can get and delete books IN ALL subject areas with a tap!"
It was a first for my grandson. He loved it
"Great product, does everything"
"I like it!! The only thing I dislike about the Kindle Fire HD 7 is that you can't change your background and you have to pay even more money to get rid of the ads on the lock screen!!! You want us to pay more for something we already bought?! I think that's horrible. I almost returned it until a friend loaned me some money to get rid of the ads. Not a good quality, Amazon."
Love!
I really like playing Words With Friends on it--much larger than on the phone.  I'm glad I've got a son in IT because I didn't know how to set it up.  I just wish it came with a little book for those of us who don't even know how to find the help.
I am satisfied so far with my Kindle Fire HD
"I love my Kindle Fire! I think I am addicted to the games, puzzles, books, Facebook, and e-mail!  When my last one &#34;kicked the bucket&#34;, I could barely wait until the new one arrived. And, I love the bright magenta color!"
"Still working on my defaults, but I like everything about it so far..."
I love it
"I finally received my kindle, I think this purchase took too long to be delivered as compared with the other items I purchased, nevertheless, I am satisfied"
Simply does  the job . Great value lots of accessories for the price.
"Smooth and easy. Great navigation, love it!"
NICE SIZE..........STILL LEARNING NEW THINGS ABOUT IT DAILY
+++Thank you !!!  --  Good Product !!! +++
Enjoy my kindle. This hd7 is awesome. Haven't had it very long but I have have 3 and have been extremely satisfied. And reinventing amazon for information problems they have been excellent
"really has performed beyond what I expected. The HD is excellent and have found it very responsive to what I wanted it to do. Being an older user I was not familiar with how to get to the various operations that I wanted, so I bought a &#34;instruction guide&#34; to help me find things."
I love my Fire HD 7.  Had I purchased the tablet earlier I never would have spent money to replace my Mac laptop. The size is perfect for travel. Wi-Fi connection is fast and easy. The HD DISPLAY PROVIDES a sharp clear picture. What an amazing product for such a great price.
My son loves it ! His first device !
I bought this Kindle Fire HDX for my sister.<br />She loves it.
I love this device...I had an older version and the improvements are great...
Best thing to have on a trip or work
"I love this thing but am still learning how to use it.  A bit disappointed with the battery life however.  Even when the WiFi is turned off it uses a lot of battery just reading a book for a few hours.  Other then that, its great.  Also bought my mother one and she loves it just as much."
I just bought a new Kindle Fire HD 7 in.  I lost previous Kindle and was so happy to see this one on sale for much less than the one I lost. I don't leave home without it.  It is so fast and covers everything I need on a tablet.
No problem
Love it
A great tablet option for the price
Love it.
"I was hesitant about buying a Kindle as I hated my Nook, however this is the best purchase I made all year I love"
"I do like the Kindle Fire. The like the apps I downloaded BUT the biggest feature I miss from my previous Kindle was the ability to create folders for my books (mystery, romance, horror) books being the main reason I have a Kindle. The extras are just that. Also seeing all of my books all on the Home Screen is just annoying."
"My husband love this!  He takes it along when he travels.  He can watch movies, work, check his email etc...."
"Already had an older Kindle fire and this new HD version is much improved. It has faster WiFi, sharper view, and much, much improved audio. It also has front and rear camera. The only negative is that it is worse about dropping the wireless connection. It will say tab not responding and requires you to reconnect. Not too big of a deal, but that is what kept me from rating it 5 star."
Awesome everything I hoped it would be and more!
I am pleased with my Fire HD7.  I am still learning how to use it's many functions.
Wonderful
Awesome!
Got this for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it...
"We love it!!! She has Bering doing great at reading so we got her this for reading and she's been reading even more!! Great size, great quality And beautiful picture"
"It is a whole lot like my old kindle, don't care much for the adds and the lock system"
Easy to read. Like the kindle!
Amazing ! Love it worth every penny!
Very cool to use it.
"I need personal docs and programs, which I can use for continual updated commentary and product improvement so that the product life, warranty extension criteria and function improvement ideas will be socially and publicly processed with discounts across the board for all and a small incentive discount given for exceptional content."
Love this kindle! I purchased this to replace my old one and I love it even more!
So far so good.
I like it very much a lot I do not understand yet.
"Works well. I hope there will be more textbooks available later. Mind you there is quite a selection as is, however, they're still lacking in some areas."
Love it so far.
"I still have the original Kindle Fire and, although of course the charge doesn't as long as it used to, it still works just fine. It's been bounced down a fight of 12 stairs TWICE and still works flawlessly! And I still get a good few hours from a charge. I have friends who absolutely love the Fire HD and have no problems with it. I'm considering updating to the HD7 just to get the new battery life, but I'm in no hurry!"
"Great value for the hardware you are receiving, but the limits imposed by Amazon really handicap the device. The Amazon app store is truly second rate, which is vastly puzzling to me. There's really no reason for it not to be on par with Google Play Store, especially if the Fire OS prohibits the user from using the Play Store. Instead of keeping up, Amazon allows tumble weeds to blow through its market, content to be last place.<br />As an example, today a game I play pushed a required update. Amazon has not yet publish it however. It's available on my android and Apple devices, but the game is now unplayable on Kindle."
Ilove this kindle.  It exceeded all my expectations.  It was easy to set up and easier to use.  The battery lasts a long long time.  All in all I am very happy to have this product.
I was a little weary trying to decided if I wanted to purchase this because I'm an Apple girl.  I have an older iPad and a Kindle Paperwhite and didn't see the need for another device.  My iPad was getting slower and began cutting off so I took the plunge.  I'm glad I didn't.  It's the perfect size and has enough storage for my needs.  It's great for travel and being able to read the books that are on my Paperwhite is an added bonus.
Awesome product.  Perfect for bedtime ebooks.
My son has the 2012 version of the kindle fire HD7 this seems to be a great improvement from that one. Perfect little tablet for the kiddos.
"Bought 4 of these for my kids for Christmas.  16 months in, they will be happy to give me a discount on a new kindle since these stopped charging.  All 4 have messed up within weeks of each other.  Of course, it must be something that we are doing wrong...not that the product is bad.  I would say, buy a better product...these are not worth it."
I love it!
"A great, inexpensive tablet.  We bought this for our daughter without knowing that it has an awesome way to control what content she has access to, and she has no access to the internet.  LOVE this feature.  Highly recommend this tablet."
It is everything I wanted.
"So far I'm not real impressed.  The battery life is not so great, and the operating system is not real user friendly."
love it. its wonderful .would and will buy another.
Great product.
"It is not as easy to figure out as mine, complicated trying to down load stuff"
Excellent quality.  Well worth the $$.
"This would be awesome…but there is no battery life at all to the device. We have owned so many different tablets….galaxy, apple iPad mini…this thing is a shame. I use it mostly to read pdf power points for my school lectures. I turn it on airplane mode and the battery is dead in less than an hour. Never had a problem like this and have tried many different things on the device and settings to resolve this issue with no luck. It sits in my cupboard mostly. I don't want to charge it and drag it around for less than an hour I'd rather use my cell phone or laptop to surf and look things up. Won't buy another one in the future."
Good kindle for the price.
More than met my expectations!  Great device!
"So locked down and unusable that it makes me want to boycott Amazon. You have to pay an extra fee to remove ads, and YOU STILL HAVE ADS! Additionally, the fact that the device must have credit card associated, and with no apparent way of disabling 1-click ordering on the main account, you can very easily accidentally buy a $20 book, and even if you click cancel right away, it may take several hours to get refunded. This whole thing is absurdly deplorable."
They are pretty good tablets but the inability to install apps you have previously purchased is fatal.
Works great
Would be 5 but the front camera has scrappy quality and half the stuff i had on my last phone I can't get on here because Amazon didn't have the google market
"Update: after 6 months of use and 3 replacement units I'm never buying another amazon tablet again. Updates are forced and you can not opt out of them. Each time there is a major update it causes my tablet to not work correctly anymore, to the point where it cant turn on. after 4 replacements I am finally calling it quits. never again will I buy a amazon tablet. Save yourself the time and money and buy a android tablet, you will thank me later."
love  this product .sorry I didn't get it sooner love everything about it
Easy to use there is so much to do and read. Would love to use attach my printer to it ?
I thought it was the kindle fire HD. I don't like the fact that my fire hd keeps shutting off by itself and it has battery life and it act like it don't want to come on when I push the power button.
So easy-to-use.
This is my 3rd Kindle.  Couldn't ask for a better products.
Forcing me to enter a pin every time I start up and the ads are a big downer.  Of I had known about that I would have bought something else instead
"Nice, very nice."
I'm not into gadgets and such but I do<br />Like the convience of owning laptops<br />Smart phones and tablets. I really like my Kindle Fire HD7. I have to admit (shamefully) that this is my THIRD Kindle<br />Within a year. You see I am very clumsy and<br />I bump and trip and bang into things constantly I also drop stuff ! Sooo with<br />all that said you can understand why this is my THIRD Kindle. Let me say that the Kindle customer service is excellent they do all they can to accommodate you and<br />I really appreciate their help. The only complaint that I have is that the Kindle can be easily damaged (I am a expert about this because this is my THIRD Kindle) but this time I also purchased a<br />Very good case for it and I'm going to purchase the protection plan because<br />This is my THIRD Kindle. I love my<br />THIRD Kindle!
"I bought the magenta color; however, it's more like a &#34;hot pink&#34; color."
even better than my last one. (which I left on an airplane)
Best device ever
Well pleased
My son has the first generation Fire HD and loves it. Thought it was time for mommy to join him. I love the ability to read but also let my younger child play games or read herself with the free time app. Love kindles!!
"This worked beautifully at my sister's house in another state, but I can't get it connected to my home wi-fi"
"Love my Kindle! I know some people complain about missing the smell and feel of a real book, but you can't beat going on vacation with 5+ books tucked in your purse. I can read on the beach or in bed at night with the lights off.  I love that I can adjust the size of the font and read without my glasses also. I honestly couldn't live without my Kindle!"
Love it !
"Battery life poor,& a lot of generic apps"
"I love this Kindle.  It's small, light, easy to use, and fits easily in my purse.  I have about 4 other generations of Kindle so I consider myself somewhat of a Kindle expert.  It's my favorite item, it goes with me everywhere.  Great value, too."
"Love, love, love my Fire! Sleek and light, beautifully vivid screen and great response time! I still haven't explored all I can do on it!"
"If you just need this as an ereader, it's great.  But if you want to use it like a mini computer, it freezes a lot."
I'm disappointed because it doesn't do the one thing I wanted most.  I wanted to be able to mirror the tablet on my TV screen.  It was advertised to do that but it doesn't do it.  I didn't return it because I have all my personal information on it.  I use it to read and as a tablet but each time I use it I'm reminded of how disappointed I am.
Works great
"Love it, this is my fourth Kindle.  The white is really nice."
"I'm probably being overly critical here because this device is really low priced. Despite how terrible I find it to actually use, I can see that for many people that price point would make it possible to even get a tablet. If you have need of a tablet and all you can afford is $100, this is probably a good choice for you.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this thing basically sits on my shelf occasionally serving as a Spotify player. It's too irritating to use for most any other purpose. Visually, the interface is jarring. I often can't easily find the information/widget I'm looking for. Then there's other times when two widgets with the same functionality are on the screen at the same time, taking up extra space and incurring a weird sort of cognitive disruption from the redundancy. The scanner has poor sensitivity and often misregisters where my finger has touched. Many seemingly basic apps are laggy, leading me to think the processor is underpowered. The batter life plain sucks. If fully charged I leave it sit for two days, it's dead when I go to use it. I can let my laptop sit sleeping for a week and it's still got charge when I pick it up.<br /><br />Overall it's just a pain to use. The whole appeal of the tablet touch interface is that you don't really notice it. You just get absorbed into the process of using it. This is the complete opposite. There's friction nearly every step of the way. The layout, the clunky graphics, the laggy, unresponsive screen, and the lack of Google Play store access means you're stuck with a limited selection of mostly crappy apps.<br /><br />If you can afford anything better, go for it."
Love it
"I like it. I need to use it more, but when I do use it I like it."
Needs better app store organization
I love the fire being small to carry around the house and the screen size is not too big! I use it to check my email and web search! The battery seems to last so far! I will update this review as I use it more!!
Like it but disappointed that it does not turn on when you open the cover like my other Kindle Fire.
"Its great, very nice tablet."
I hope I can learn how to do all the things this thing can do.
Bought for a 6 year old. It's easy to navigate. Free time subscription is worth it. Screen size good.
Awesome.
LOVE IT ! SCREEN NICE AND BRIGHT!
I love it sooooo much!~
Dum Amazon that left the tablet on ground? Out side! If it was stolen then what???
very pleased with this purchase it is by far better than my old Nook device however i had to download a free keyboard in order to finger type correctly and on occasion i do get booted out of whatever i may be in but overall it is very fast as well as sleek and it is a bit lighter than my old device which i greatly appreciate i am going to have quite a ball this summer and oh one more thing i failed to add as a prime Amazon costumer u also get free music!
Great to search Internet but I mostly use it to read
"Totally love this thing.  First tablet thingy I have bought.  Purchased one for me and for my 16yr old daughter (she loves hers)..Only bad thing is that it has too much glare on the viewing screen.  Although, everything is crystal clear.  Me still getting use to it, but have no major complaints.  Will eventually figure out how to get screen display to TV.  NO REGRESTs as I bought these two beow $80.00 each.  Wonderful deal for a kindle."
Good tablet but no directions with it.
I wish I could connect 3 g or 4 g when I don't have a wifi connection
"When I turned it on, all displays were in Chinese.  Since I don't read Chinese, I had to call for assistance to guide me to the correct tab in the Settings to change the language.  Other than that, it's been great!  One note:  this is my second Kindle Fire --- the first one was in a protective case but fell to the floor from a counter top and the screen shattered.  I hope this one is not as &#34;tender&#34;."
Had a kindle for years but love my new kindle fire!!
"Absolutely love it!  Will never buy another kind of tablet, and Amazon services like Prime and Kindle Unlimited are terrific values."
"I am still learning the ins and outs of the device, but so far there are no surprises. I have read the reviews and expected the ads and yes, they are annoying. My only real complaint concerns the screen. After a few days the screen felt tacky and gritty; I never use screen protectors since I can never manage not to get air bubbles. No phone screen, other tablet, or even my B&N Nook has ever had this issue. Had to use TV screen cleaner and it worked, but was not expecting to need this type of maintenance. I now understand why a cleaning kit was 'recommended'. Otherwise, it was worth the price."
Love it!
"I love my new Fire HD 7.  The picture is definitely HD quality.  Improved sound from my first generation Fire tablet.  It is user friendly and extremely fast in downloading apps, books, etc.  Thank you again Amazon for developing a beautiful product like this!"
"Was not user friendly. But, I have watched a movie on it and the picture was great.  My music ended up all over the place, that was annoying!"
"this tablet excides my expectations, couldn't be happier"
i like it
"I like the Fire HD 7 very much.  This is my second Kindle, I purchased another Kindle because I liked my first one so much. They are easy to navigate around to the different web sites.  Anyone who purchases one will like it also."
they are breakable .dropped onfloor 12 inches to ground screen cracked.commercial lies!!!!!!!!!
thought the Amazon Prime was for a year not just a free 1 month trial.
Works great what else do you expect from a kindle.
Great deal and good quality
Love it!!! Thinking of getting them for my kids too!
"works very well, much better than the original fire, hope they fixed the charging ports."
This is a great little device.  I bought it for my 7 year old son and he uses it everyday for the time we allot.  The screen is good and it is easy to use.
"This was a Mother's Day gift for my wife, and she now uses it regularly.  Excellent tablet."
perfect easy set up
It is very  reliable and does many things that larger products can do. It is small so easy to take with you. It was a gift and I am pleased to have it. Rona Subotnik
Love it
Haven't used it much but very satisfied with it when I have used it!
Grandson loves the Fire!  I have not had much opportunity to use it as he spends a lot of time on it.  The little bit of time I havw spent I do like all of the features.
"I am so pleased with this tablet.  It is far superior to the Next book I previously had.  I love the amount of memory available, the screen clarity, the speed.  I have nothing bad to say!"
"This is my SIXTH KINDLE, - two were given to me, and I re-gave them to a family member - and I bought FOUR. The two FIRES HD 7&#34; were an especially good deal even with the $20 added for the 16 GB version. These Kindles last and last (unless you leave them on your bed and kneel on the screen, as a family member did - TWICE!! I think she learned the lesson that you leave nothing where you can sit/kneel on them and break them.)<br />If you mostly read or listen to audiobooks, the Kindle HD 7&#34; is perfect. I have not tried videos because I have no time for viewing; I am happy if I can eke out time for reading or listening to a book while I do other undemanding tasks. I have not even tried other cool things you can do with this Kindle, but some day I shall!<br />I also like the Amazon support. I can rely on this company to be interested in making their customers satisfied with their product and service."
I love my Kindle! My sisters went together on it and gave it as a b-day gift.  I couldn't be more surprised or pleased.  I am looking forward to taking it to Ireland on my anniversary trip next month and not having to lug a bunch of books!
"For the price, this was awesome. I have an ipad and android phone and it's comparable to their functionality but limited to amazon apps only which is kinda disappointing that you can't get into the google play store unless you root your device, but it's still a nice addition that gives me use of my ipad when I need it and the kid won't let it go. Also the 1 click app purchase is a scary thing, luckily you can setup child profiles and disable in-app purchases to help eliminate that. The screen size is good for most apps, some however cut off slightly which is a little annoying. The speakers are a lot louder than the ipad mini or phone i have so that's good usually I guess. Some apps I use as a web developer are not available or cost money i.e. dropbox, I'm guessing that's because developers get fed up with having to create and manage new ones beyond ios and google, I had this same issue on the Nook before they enabled the Play store, so I don't use it as a production tool much except to verify certain pages look right in the Kindle's default browser. No buttons is a little strange too, well except the power and volume, so at this time the only way I know how to switch back to my main profile is to press the power button. And the only other oddity I noticed is that, even with automatic updates for apps enabled the apps still need to be manually updated through the appstore rather than just updating automatically... I did get a notification that an app was updated so that was cool but why not just update automatically, maybe it's another setting or something else has to be enabled...? Otherwise it's been real nice, I like the free app of the day deal, better than apple's free app of the week and better variety of picks too. Some apps seem to even be updated faster than the same ones on the ipad. I haven't used the camera much yet but it seems ok, I can imagine that just like the ipad camera I'll never use it unless I someday feel like doing facetime which I have yet to find a reason to use that. And finally I might use it to watch movies or tv shows if I ever find myself stuck in an airport someday but I don't see that happening anytime soon. My son uses it constantly to watch youtube videos though so it's definitely good for that, or I might even hook it up to my stereo, and of course the main purpose of the kindle originally, reading books.find a reason to use that.

Love it
"I wanted to love this product, but.... It seems to work well, but the configuration option of 7&#34; and only 8 GB of memory is limited.  Removable memory should be supported, or at least configure to allow for 7&#34; and 16 GB.  Not a huge fan of the Amazon flavor of Android's software, but it's not awful."
"Absolutely love this, my grandson was so excited."
This was a gift for my 12 year old son. It's really sturdy and user friendly. I like that it's easy to navigate and has a great screen size. I'm very happy with this purchase.
Works very nicely.  Great deal and good quality.  Like that is has the book speaking feature so you can hear the book while doing things in the kitchen.
just what I was wanting
"Overall is a great product, especially for reading and watching media. It has also a great quality speaker. The body is robust and it feels really durable.  The battery is good too. My only regret is not having bought the one with 16 gb of storage. The rest works great."
"I love my Kindle Fire HD 7. I bought it on sale a few months ago to replace my old Kindle Touch.<br /><br />I was worried that the 7&#34; screen would be too uncomfortable or small for browsing the web and watching videos, but it actually feels like the perfect size. It's not too small and not too big (fits in all my bags). I also love the response speed. When I touch something, it responds immediately, which is much different from my old Kindle Touch. I really love that the Kindle Fire functions not only as an e-reader, but a tablet as well. It's nice to sit on the couch and surf the web, watch videos, check my email, etc without a big laptop. There are quite a few apps and games available for the Kindle as well. The only negative thing I can think of is that the camera on it (and there are two: one front-facing and one on the back) isn't great quality. The photos are a bit grainy.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is the Docs tab. There's a plug-in that you can install for Chrome or Firefox that lets you send articles on the web to your Kindle either via Wifi or Whispernet. It's incredibly useful and like a whole new way to bookmark things. I've used it to save and read (on my Kindle) articles on a Russian science journal, PostNauka, as well as Wikipedia and Wiktionary You can even save parts of web pages and paragraphs to send. It's really great.<br /><br />All in all, I'm a very satisfied customer. I have no complaints because the Kindle HD7 meets all my needs. It's a fabulous e-reader and tablet."
"This kindle is amazing, to use an overused word. It transfers content completely and easily.  It remembers added words, often used words, names and passwords more quickly than any other kindle I have owned. I LOVE the two cameras and the ability to easily film motion as well. I even like the special adds, which often lead me to new books to read, or authors I like. Hope you enjoy the new kindle fire 7 when you get your's. By the way, spring for the 16 GB , it is worth it."
Love it.
It has turned out to be a good Kindle substitute. The new narrating voice is well done for being computerized.
"Great Tablet at half the cost! Buy it, you won't be disappointed"
I am enjoying it right now!!
"This thing takes too long to charge and if you are using it while trying to charge it, forget it."
Purchased for my husband. He loves it!<br />He is a newbie to the tablets and is navigating it very well! He has downloaded his favorite apps.<br /> Overall we are very happy with this purchase.
"Really great. A lot faster than the other one. I like the camera, just trying to figure out how to download the pictures to print."
They are what I expected
"Very pleased with my purchase. Bought it at the PX at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Does everything I want so far."
Great price
Unable to set up my email.  Tried an all email app but that was strange to use.  Found out the email is and older version (4.4) and had me wondering what else on the tablet wasn't updated or had older versions so I've decided to exchange it.  Hope the next one has the updates.  My sister has one with the updated email (5.5) and absolutely loves it.  She gives it 5 stars.
Just what I wanted.  Very happy with this purchase!
It's awesome. Feature I like the most is downloading Prime movies to it and being able to watch about half of them without an internet or wifi connection.
Great love it
Very easy to use.
Gift haven't heard how they like it yet.
the problem is that Prime free movies will not work when traveling in the eastern Europe
"Still learning about the item, but really love this item.  Great product and fantastic price. Always happy with my Amazon"
I got this for entertainment it's good for movies but I can't get all the music that I want I'm some websites that I'm used to getting it from
I had an  ereader before and I loved it.  I tried the Fire 7 but it was just too  much for me.  I want  a reader I can just read books on.<br />Do you make these anymore?  Thank you.  Carole Miller
"I am so glad that I purchased this Kindle Fire!  It is everything I hoped for and much more.  I can now take good pictures and share them on Facebook.  I have downloaded some great games which I enjoy immensely.  I can also watch Netflix and You Tube if I want to.  I know that I have not tapped into all of the things that this tablet is capable of, that may take me a while, however, I am having a great time with my Kindle Fire.  I highly recommend this tablet, for the money I spent on it, I get so much in quality and jus plain enjoyment!  Thank you Amazon, you never fail to please me!"
"Love it, tried another brand and can't live without my Kindle"
Love this !!!
I love kindles . That is all.
"Everything I expected it to be. Arrived on time, no problems."
"Very user friendly.  Enjoy the ease of access to apps and support when I have questions!  The movies, music and books available are incredible!  I love it!!!"
"Have not had internet access until today, so I have not been able to rate the fire. So far so good. I'm now learning how to use it. Will give a more involved rating in the following weeks. It's easy to use, and strands up to hard use. I gave one to a friend, who is not tech savvy, and she has found it easy to use, and not difficult to understand. She would like the font size to get larger, as she has trouble reading small print."
"I love my Fire. It is the perfect size for holding while reading. I can get a lot of books free and at low cost so I never run out of reading material. I have really enjoyed reading my free subscription to the Washington Post. The Fire has good speed to check my emails,to shop and just to browse the internet. There is a lot of apps and games for the fire."
Love my new Fire 7&#34; HD with a front and back facing camera! It's my third Kindle and it's my new favorite at a great price and in many colors!
Nice
it's to early to tell but i'm optomistic.
"Awesome! I've had my Kindle for about a month and a 1/2. My magazines, books, and movies, and tv shows are conveniently at my finger tips."
"This is my 5th Kindle Fire HD (7th Kindle overall counting my Kindle 2nd Generation and Kindle Paperwhite) and I love it.  The reason I've had to buy 5?  My family kept taking them over!  Love the convenience - no more taking bags of  books on vacation, no need to take the laptops along - everything we need is contained on in our Kindles.  Love the convenience of having it all, camera, internet, books and games at my fingertips."
Great and has a camera now too! !
These are the best. Love it
"Love, love it!!  I had the 2nd generation Kindle.  There was nothing wrong with it, just wanted to upgrade.  And so glad I did!  I really like the slim style.  Fits really nice in my hand.  Easier to hold while reading & I read a lot!  Not sorry!!  Light weight which makes it easy to carry in purse or carry on."
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!
This Kindle is great....it is the perfect size to take everywhere you go.
"I recently purchased a kindle fire for my wife and I think it's the hostile, unfriendly user interface to learn. Upon firing it up you have to know something of interface to even install it because there is no document worth anything to give you a clue. I began my computer career in 1965 and been involved with it ever since. I have own personal computers since the beginning of those including a Commodore 64. I worked for Digital Equipment from 1969 to 1980. My last company started in the early days of the web to use DB to register classes, ecommerce etc. I think I have an understanding of user interfaces.<br /><br />While once learned it may be great but is not intuitive and the help, the big ?, which comes up with 'we are here to help' but no obvious link to that help.<br /><br />For one we wanted a tutorial. So far we haven't found on the device. I wanted to connect to a printer and went to settings. Sorry that was a dead end. Turns out you have to try to print before you can connect to a wireless printer.<br /><br />I have never tried a IPOD  so maybe it's as bad but if you have a hard time with a PC you haven't seen nothing yet.<br /><br />It's to bad because the Kindle was so great and the voice recognition is absolutely great."
Could not get  lexia core or clash of clans but the kids love it.
"great for books and ok for a tablet, but the interface is a bit clunky."
I love my new kindle fire..
Great Product.
Great product and ease of use.  I was hesitant to purchase but so happy I did. I use it more than another product I won. My husband uses that to play games and I sue the FIRE for more practical purposes! I like the linking future and can read my kindle books on the go. The camera feature front and back is always an added benefit!
Works great have 2 working at home
i bought this as a gift for my mom.  It was a little tricky touching the screen for the password.  My Ipad is not as sensitive.  It was very frustrating for her and me!
5 Stars
Love it
Some difficulty setting up. However the reader has met expectations.
My daughter love it!
Terrible camera. Can't get reading view on everything it should to be helpful.
Love this kindle.
worked good in Europe. Not too painful a earning curve. How do you get pictures out of it?
Not very happy with the Kindle.  Keeps freezing and it won't work at all. Doesn't hold a charge. Very disappointed.
Bought this for my child but now wish it was mine.  The size is perfect and easily manageable.  The camera and screen resolution is wonderful and the system is very easy to navigate. Very happy with this purchase.
Great unit
Love it! Easy to use. Lightweight
Enjoying my kindle fire 7&#34;hd so much!
Very happy with it so far.
I love it!
Very easy to use!  The quality of pics etc very sharp~
First time tablet purchaser so I wasn't sure what to expect. I've always had an iPhone now I have the 6plus it's the only thing I have used to compare it to. Disappointed with the speed and it freezes sometimes but all in all serves its purpose
I love my new fire. It's so easy to use. I have down loaded a couple of  books and really enjoyed reading them. There are so many uses. It's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it.
Very easy to work for an older person...
It's getting a little easier to navigate but still have a ways to go to find the section of books I would like to read.
my 6 and 7 year old love them easy to use and my husband and I get to apply parental control to what and where its needed excellent buy and got a very good price.
Basic tablet.  Seems sturdy but it's plasticy and very light.  Cannot be easily rooted to install custom ROMs.
very nice
"My son loves his kindle, but I'm having trouble finding a controller for it.  Moga and Mad Catz say that Amazon tweeked the Android compatibility to the point where they will not work. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
the device is o.k i got it to read on it and watch tv on the airplane but it is not working for watching...
I have difficulty in bringing up the HOME and return icons.  Sometimes trying a dozen or more times.  Very annoying.
as expected but a little slow...
This is the best kindle made yet! It has everything you need in one little device.
"While this is a much much better machine than the original Kindle Fire that came before some two years ago I am greatly offended by the fact that each time  I turn this Fire on, the &#34;Screen Saver&#34; is an ad from Amazon for some inane game or service I don't want to see. This is my machine; I own it. Amazon is NOT entitled invade my  tablet to send these solicitations unless the service agreement allows for such activity. If the service agreement does allow for these annoyances, Amazon ought to drop the this kind of behavior."
my boyfriend loves it.
Over heats and never works right. Love last version.  Awful awful awful
I love it.
Love it! Lighter and cooler color!
"It's a Kindle so it should be good, right. Well not so good when it is finicky about connecting and frequent screen blackouts. Sent first one back, got new one immediately, same crap."
So far I haven't found anything I don't like about it.  I'm very satisfied.
I love it
"Love the front facing camera. Fantastic pictures. I am getting used to the new placement of on off buttons, as well as volume buttons. Why the need to move them around? I love the fact that it's light as a feather. I choose the magenta for this one. It's very cheery. My granddaughter likes it too. My grandson plays with the black one, but really want camp. This old dog is learning new tricks. Good job"
3rd Kindle. Enough said. This one was for my hubby. He absolutely loved the surprise. He was always using mine so it only made sense to get him one. We love the upgraded features since the original.
Great deal.  Does what I want it to do.  Downloaded Overdrive so I can check out epub books from the library as well as kindle.  Excellent value.
I really love my Fire HD. I like the increase in the screen size. It also seems brighter and easier to use.
too bulky- made the kindle look smaller-
Received it before we went on vacation and did not take it with us.  We will work on it as soon as we can and will write a great review I am sure
I like it. Good price on sale. love the reading view on the browser.
love it
"I love it, I had the original Kindle Fire for many years and that still works great, the new Kindle Fire is wonderful also. I love it."
Love the product
It was all I expect. Thank you
"Finally got myself a Fire, and so glad I did.  Love my Kindle."
No review
My daughter loves it. It's a great tablet but it should have a better camera and the setup shouldn't need a amazon account.
I just love my kindle
Everything I expected. Great price. Would highly recommend to others.
"I am wondering why it took me so long to buy.  This device is great for all the fun and adventure you would want.  Easy to use and You never get tired of all the apps.  It you are looking for amusement and information with all the features of fun, games, music, contact, and a window to the world this is the machine you will want to purchase.  The price is right and it is worth every cent."
Love the new one. Got 2 and they both work. New one is better.
It did not fit
"Love my new HD fire,now I have a kindle fire and HD fire and love them both!"
"I am just getting used to it now. Delivery was as stated fast.  I am very pleased with the quality of the Fire HD 7.  The screen is clear, the downloading of apps is fast, and music is downloaded in only seconds.  I am so pleased and would recommend this to anyone. Look forward to enjoying this for a long time."
Love itttt
Both are great. Have no complaints.
Battery recharge has no visible cue when fully charged as older models did<br />Also airplane mode for WiFi connection is awkward and ridiculous.
I bought this to use my square acct. But it is not compatable. I am finding that it is very limited in what this device can do. This purchase was a waste  of money for me.
needs google play
"gift for wife, she loves it"
Was worth the money. Great for reading on and it does more than just reading. Have it running our cable TV app and can watch TV on it easily. Glad I got the 16GB and 7&#34; screen. Just the right size of viewing area for what I'm using it for.
I love it it
Great reader with the bonus of being a tablet also.
"Looks nice, but I can barely used it. I haven't found an easy way to access Google. I, somehow, turned on some parental filters. I have no children, no need for this, and don't know how I got to this screen, or why it says I turned on this feature. I could find no way to undo or cancel it. Nor could I find how to exit this screen except by turning off my Fire, waiting awhile, and turning it back on again. I still don't know how to get to this screen. I had difficulty in getting it to recognize me and open up it's features when I first turned it on. I stumbled my way in. I don't know why it accepted me the next time I turned it on when it didn't the first time. No paper instructions so I couldn't get any help about how to do this, or use other features, until I got in to read instructions on screen. A paper &#34;how to&#34; and &#34;what you need to do first&#34; included in the box would have been more helpful. Apparently you assume everyone knows how to use current electronic devices. Some of us old folks don't. I've never had a smart phone, or tablet, or anything else that would have clued me in. This Kindle is my first. It now usually takes me to my local library screen even when I don't want to got there. That just comes up. Accessing electronic media at the library is one of the reasons I bought this. I think, with further help from a librarian, I'll be able to do this. I downloaded some books that told they had downloaded. They're not on my Kindle. The only book that is is a dictionary that I didn't download so I'm guessing you folks did it. Thanks. Nice to have. I think the books I downloaded are in cloud limbo and will show when I figure out how to set up my email IP link. I discovered you've assigned me a new email address. I didn't know I needed a different one. But I'm glad I discovered where where to find it--after a couple of tries. I don't know which one, my normal email address that I get me email at, or they new one that maybe I'll get email at. (I don't know since I haven't been able to connect.) Or if I need to connect both. I haven't found information on what I need to do. Where is it? So currently I don't think I can buy anything because I don't trust that I'll get it on my Kindle Fire. I'm not unintelligent, but, I am electronic device challenged. I also can't make the screen change between vertical or horizontal orientation, when I want to, all of the time--or keep it from flipping back by itself. I see apps I don't use, but, I assume many others do, or you wouldn't have included them. I don't think I've tried to download any except an app that will let me order from Amazon.com.  I couldn't tell if I needed to download an Amazon app, if it came included, or if I was successful when I tried to download it. Nothing said it's now downloaded and I don't see it listed with other apps. Should I, or is it part of the architecture that I'm assumed to know about? I want to read books on my Kindle but so far cannot. I have some trouble getting to, or back to (if I've slipped out), a screen I want displayed. Some places it's easy to go back or forward. Some place this seems to not be doable. I'm assuming that this device is designed to allow a user to back out to a previous screen. It is not always easy to see how. It's also difficult, sometimes, to get from one screen to another. It was, for example, difficult to do so when setting up my link to my local library--for the reference librarian at the library doing it for me.I knew this was beyond my capabilities. I also discovered that the battery wears down at a prodigious rate when it is turned off. I assume this is due to some housekeeping function. I now leave it attached to an outside power source when not in use. I find the symbols of where to take it (what function) somewhat opaque. I'm learning them so eventually I don't expect this to be a problem. Navigating between I expect to continue to be a problem. Sometimes the Kindle goes where it wants to take me, not where I want to take it. This is more of a list than you expected. I'll stop now. I rated it 2 instead of 1 because I assume my ignorance is a large part of my problem. I frequently don't find the &#34;help&#34; pages very helpful. I don't know how to interpret the words often. I know it's clear in the mind of the writer, but I can't always tell what was meant or how to implement the instructions. If you've got customer service reps who can walk me through how to use my Kindle I'd appreciate it. Addendum: Looking at the manual again after posting I figured some more of it. Not enough yet but some more of it. I'm sure most of you will have less trouble than I am."
"After 3 kindles in just over 2 years I am done! Charge never lasts, even plugged to power source it lasts only 1.5 hours. I have tried all suggested fixes. The idea of kindle is great, but not worth the $ for only a few months of use. I will never buy another. I am now purchasing an iPad. They cost more, but they seem to last."
My little guy loves it...
This is better than the next generation Kindle Fire except that it doesn't have an SD card slot.
I love my kind love my new and old Kindle.
I really like it. Trying to figure it all out...like being able to have wifibon when I am not at home.
Love it!
"This was given as a gift for my daughter who was diagnosed with a very serious rare disease. It has allowed her to stay in contact with her friends, read books when she can't watch tv, and play games to distract her from her discomforts and frustrations. One of the best gifts she has ever received."
"I love it, would like to know where to buy the amazon card to purchase books.  best buy no longer handles them.<br />Thanks,<br />Mrs. Hugh Nelson"
"I love the Fire HD 7.  It was easy to start up.  I am having good results with downloading books, apps and I am hoping to explore other programs in the future.  I am happy to recommend this product and feel that the price was affordable."
"Great, enjoying my New Toy!!"
The Tablet I have ever purchased it does all the things I will ever need.
it's just what I expected.
"Easy to use,lightweight. I bought this one for my husband because I like mine so much"
"I love it.  I am in my seventies , and having a ball with my new tablet."
"Great tablet, with decent battery life and function. It's a great buy for what I need it for and for what I paid for it. I wish the standby battery life is a bit better. It works very well other than the ad that comes on everytime I wake up the tablet and I'm too cheap to pay to get rid of it."
Works great so far.
Love it!  Great device for a fraction of the cost of an iPad.  Charges quickly.
"I bought this Fire HD 7 only because Kindle finally came out with two cameras.  I had the Kindle Fire 7 I bought a couple of years go but only used it to read.  So this new Fire I've been using email, face book and much more then the last Kindle.  But there's on thing I don't like about this one.  Now that the snow is gone and the weather is warm enough to side outside and read,  It's very annoying to try and read with all that glare and reflection on the glass.  So if you Kindle people read this,  please  change that glass to a non glare glass.  I do like this Fire HD 7  and I'm learning how to set up more things on it so I'm enjoying it more."
Very nice so far no complaints
"So far, I really like it. Still learning how to use it.I especially like the speakers. Terrific sound. The picture is good too. A great upgrade from my older Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Mike Boyd"
"Love, love, love my Kindle. This is at least the 9th I've bought for family and friends! We are all avid readers and can't get enough!!! One of my favorite possessions!"
Really enjoy my Kindle Fire!  It loads much faster than my laptop and the color is great.  Taking pictures is a breeze.  Well worth the money!
"While not nearly as easy to use as the ipad, considering the Fire is a third of the price, it really is pretty simple once you figure out how to use it. Totally worth the price and great for kids since they can each have their own profile and the parent has to approve all the apps. Be warned: customer support for the device is terrible. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a good tablet!"
Love it! The new web browser works great. If your an Amazon fan all your content and shopping is right at your finger tips. Very sweet deal and I'm a computer engineer so I know.
I so love my Kindle. The technology on this tablet is the greatest!!!! Love the color and would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a tablet.
I love my Fire and even named it -- Ember!! I am still learning about all of its features. It's great
"I got this tablet about a month ago for my niece as her first tablet I think it is perfect. Good storage space. The reason why I gave it 4 stars only is the quality on pictures, after seeing a few taken with both cameras (front and rear) I was not impressed, the quality on them was not as I expected, good overall, just not great."
I love it!
"Great for the price, my kidz love it."
having  trouble  with the right game coming up  how I delete something on the contacts ?
"Love it! Easy to tote around, fast, easy to navigate. Very happy with it."
Best Mother's Day gift ever!
Not real happy to find out I can't use my Chromecast with it. Seems to take very grainy pics. The HDR option is slow and useless on pets or anything moving. Will probably be returning it.
Love the Fire.
Awesome
"Received this for my birthday after using a Kindle Touch for 3 years. Wow, what a difference. It lights up, has color and the clearest picture. It's easy to shop for books, movies,play games on.I have over 100 books on the Kindle touch and they are all available on the Kindle Fire through the cloud. I still use my old Kindle When  out and about a lot because the battery charge seems to last forever. Battery charge life on the new one seems quite short- my only negative."
It's a kindle--what more is there to say?
"I'm one of those older people who's hooked on the idea of physical books, so I resisted the idea of an e-reader for a long time, but now that I have one, it's hard to imagine living without it. The sheer convenience of being able to switch between books alone almost makes it worth buying, but it's also fairly easy to use (the user interface does take some getting used to, and isn't super intuitive), and very readable. It is a little heavier than most books, but manageable."
Great price for kindle fire.
very satisfied
"Great device, runs really smooth."
"This isn't  my first kindle. My first one was the paperwhite. I wanted a tablet so stuck with Amazon. While I do love it. There's a few things I don't.<br /><br /> The apps. I thought I'd have more entertainment apps. For TV channels. Instead there's only a few. Which means I'm still stuck watching them on my slow laptop. Which was my reason for wanting a tablet.<br /><br />When I'm watching HBO Go or Netflix. The volume doesn't stay the same. It'll randomly go low where I need the headphones to then going high & making me jump outta my bed/chair. Also, when I'm on those apps. When I finish a show/movie. It takes me forever to get back to homescreen. Which is prob my own stupidly. But, still lol<br /><br />To charge. OMG. I'll plug it in to charge. It literally takes FOREVER to charge. It was on 10% the other night. It took 5hrs to charge. It killed me. I was so mad. My paperwhite doesn't take that long. And, neither did my nook color when I had it.<br /><br />Other then that I'm glad I spent my money on it."
"First it did not have 8GB more like 5GB, where is other 3GB?  Love having the Kindle, the last one I had the Kindle Fire was great, this one has issues, I am getting use to them.  Prefer the other Home Page, liked where my books were, don't like the scrolling on the home page,  I did not set up for a child profiles for my Account and I can't cancel it... IT IS REQUIRED??????  why?????  .I tap and many times nothing happens...."
I love my Fire HD!
I''m enjoying it very much
"The Kindle tablet, with appropriate apps., has my mobile life simpler and efficient. This is a reliable tablet with better battery life than my associates tablets. Amazon support beyond compare."
I don't like all the ads
Awesome to catch up on my prime movies/tv shows. I was looking at buying a new laptop or tablet and this is a cheaper option and much easier to carry if you're constantly on the go.
It's amazing I love the colors.
great
I really cant rate the product because Im still trying to figure out how it works due to the fact it came with no type of instructions so honestly I have no idea what im doing or how to set it up
"This was a gift and she is delighted with it.  The portability, clarity and ease of use made it a hit.  She watches movies regularly on it."
Love my Fire.  Thanks
This is my fourth Kindle. I am guilty of loving them to death. I wish Amazon would strengthen the USB port. That is usually the first part that fails me.
"I love it!  So easy to use, great display, nice sound.  I love the portability.  Processor is very fast.  No trouble at all streaming from the internet.  Very glad I purchased this."
so much fun to watch tv and play games on a big screen
"My Mom was so excited when she opened this for mother's day!! She cannot stop talking about it.  She had the 1st generation Kindle without color or apps.  She is loving life with color and new functions like downloading movies etc.  She also has been to her local public library, where they are helping her tap into their network to download books and movies through their online portal.  She is over the moon about it. If you are thinking this would be a good gift, I believe it is a spectacular gift! She is an avid reader, so anyone you know that is a book worm would more than love this gift."
"My biggest impression of my Fire HD is disappointment. I was looking for a convenient tool, more portable than a laptop, but more functionality than my smart phone. When I saw that it used Android apps, that was the deciding factor. It wasn't until I got that I found Google Play (for downloading Android apps) and Google Drive (where most of my content is stored) did not work on it. The Kindle store has apps, but not as many and not the ones I was used to."
Not as good as my galexy tab is not as user friendly
great little tablet.  No problems so far
"I really like the Fire HD 7, 7&#34;. I have an older generation Kindle HD, which I have also enjoyed. The Fire HD 7 has several improvements that I appreciate. But I miss the &#34;go to&#34; function. That's the reason I didn't give this newer generation a five-star rating. Without the &#34;go to&#34; button I have to set bookmarks for the books I use in my collection.<br />Bring back the &#34;go to&#34; button, please!"
love it
Great Product! Very durable.
If I could I would return it. It is very restricted and unnecessarily hard to use with very limited apps.
"I got this tablet for my two grandchildren, ages 6 and 7. The had tables before but they kept breaking them. This is a sturdy tablet and I got them children's covers so they super protected. I like that I can load books and games from my house to their tablets. They are very happy with the Amazon Fire tablets, which makes me happy."
As advertised.
did fine
I like the compact feature. I can take it with me wherever I go.it fits into my pocketbook.
Great product Great quality
Does anybody have an opinion if it's worth paying the extra $15 to have the ads removed off the home screen?
I am completely happy with this kindle fire hd 7! Would recommend to anyone looking for a tablet/ reader!!
"The fire is perfect for quickly surfing the web and reading email. amazon prime membership allow access games,music,videos,newsstand and audio books.The apps available are limited.The i pad is only better with it's app selection  but cost 2.5 times more."
"Not entirely sure if this is the most recent version, but it works well for my 5-year-old. She accidentally broke the screen on my Fire HD 8.9 I bought about 3 years ago. Found out replacing that screen involves replacing the LCD as well, which was roughly $160. So I called Amazon and they gave me a great deal on this as a replacement. The only questionable issue I have is it does not seem to charge at all with a my high-tech stock multi-volt Samsung Galaxy 6 USB charger. I had to plug in the USB charger this unit came with. Then it charged to 100%. Odd as the Samsung charger works with everything else including the older HD 8.9..."
I bought Fire HD 7 for my son and he absolutely love it
This does everything I like AND more. :)
Love it
My Fire HD 7 is absolutely wonderful!!!!?
love it. easy to use so far.
"Despite the fact that I had so much trouble with my first Kindle 7 and it died after only 16 months, I ordered a replacement. I have used th is one for 9 months and can honestly say that I have no problems with it and I love it. It meets all of its stated specs. I admit that I have not yet pushed it to its limit as many others have but so far everything I want to do works beautifully. I can stream tv programs, view videos (it has an absolutely brilliant screen for this), obtain and read books and magazines from all sources, send and receive email, shop and research online, print, listen to music, view photos and play a few games. I haven't had any trouble with the USB port as I did with the first one either.  So, my only conclusion is that I originally had a &#34;lemon&#34; and it was a lemon from the start.  I strongly suggest that if you do purchase any Kindle and it doesn't work properly right away, contact Amazon and start a discussion about a replacement long before your warranty runs out.  From my experience, the Kindle either works right away or it fails right away.  When you have the working Kindle, it is a joy.  There are not an enormous number of negative comments but there are commonalities across all of them. Here are the problems that I experienced which have also been expressed by those others. I have had my Kindle 7 for 16 months and am disgusted with it: 1.  Battery charge display shows 100% one minute and 0% the next so you can never rely on the display. 2.  The charger slot is so loose that none of the chargers will stay plugged in unless it's completely still---in other words, you can't use it while it is charging. I am on my 3rd charger. At first they are snug; then they aren't. 3.  It arbitrarily powers down no matter the level of the battery charge. 4. That wouldn't be totally horrendous if you could easily boot it up again. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I've used the tricks noted by others (depress the &#34;on&#34; button for a minute,etc.). Sometimes nothing works. As now: I am on my 3rd day of not being able to get it up and running so I guess it is finally dead. 5. The screen locks up in the middle of anything you're doing. 6.  My laptop and Kindle sit next to each other. The laptop connects to the Internet and streams movies with no problems; the Kindle won't.  I have to be in the same room with the router for it to access the Internet so that I can watch movies.  These problems started within the first year I had the device but I didn't bother returning it because my niece has one with the same problems. She said that in her investigation with amazon, amazon's solution was to return it to them to rebuild but they wouldn't guarantee it. Other users had submitted comments that they had done that to no success.  So, I didn't bother.  The Kindle 7 is a piece of garbage. Yes, it is much cheaper than the full tablets so it's tempting but it will be a crap shoot as to whether you get one that works as those in the hands of the favorable commenters  or one that is like mine. Caveat emptor."
Excellent device for the value does everything and iPad will do no complaints good job Kindle
Excellent quality video. This is an amazing little tablet with a lot more to it than it would first appear. Menus are clear and helpful as well. It's a keeper.
"I have barely begun to use it at this point because I don't have wifi at my home - I know shock!  However, it has been a lot of fun to play with when I do get to use it.  I am just beginning to get all of the internet pages set up on it that I want to use.  I also love that I can read across devices now."
It's exactly what I was looking for.
"I am enjoying the bright colors and the back light.  It is so much more advanced than the old, old one I've had for 3+years.  Still working on moving around on it but it's great."
Have just been using for a short time and still learning. Very easy set up and easy to learn the basics. I mostly will be using it for reading books and it is great for that. Only con at this time is the battery life. Seems to go down very quickly.
Love it!
cool
i do love it.  I was going to take my laptop along on a weekend getaway but decided to try out this Kindle.  It did all I needed to do while away from home.  I was able to just stick it my purse and go.  no bulky laptop to lug along.  It was a great buy.
"great hardware, VERY LIMITED !!!! Only default apps, not able to rooted yet, DO NOT recommend. Older models you will be able to root, not this one."
I enjoy using my fire he 7 so far
So versatile!
"I had the first kindle when it came out.  It was good, but this version is great.  It does everything that you can ever want.<br /><br />Want google apps?  Well, you can side-load those.  You will not have play services, but you can still use chrome browser to get to google play video streaming via YouTube in  desktop mode."
Delighted with the Fired HD7!
"I absolutely LOVE it. 1) I spent 2 days  on Prime music. 2)The Dolby speakers are better sounding than on my computer. 3)Watching the MLB channel on the Kindle is just as good as watching on TV. 4) I didn't have a camera on my 1st Kindle and now having a front and back camera on my Kindle HD, Apple owners have nothing on me!. 5)Being able to put unlimited pictures into the Cloud is a super bonus and I will be transferring all my pix to the Cloud!!! 6) Last but most importantly, I am able to download even MORE books!!!!!!!!!<br />The best decision I ever made was to become an Amazon customer (way back when) because the benefits just keep getting better and better and the products are the BEST!!!!!!"
Gift for my husband. He loves it'
"So far I think it is great.  You get what you pay for, and more.  Very satisfied."
Everybody who reads needs one.
"The ease of use is remarkable. Screen quality unreal. I gave my new laptop to my son and got this!!!  Win,win!"
"Love it, best gift ever. It is easy to use, and the display screen is the best I've seen on a tablet...of any brand."
just what I wanted
I'm still learning how to use it but so far I love it.
"I have not used all the functions to date.  However, I do have one complaint.  When browsing the internet for some reason I cannot open everything within specific web sites.  I can go to my PC and there is no problem.  Perhaps there is a memory problem to help explain the limitations for browsing on this device."
great kindle love the size can hold in hand very easy.
Great
I love it. Large type when using as E book.
A little clunky and all readers need to be able to be read in daylight. Ok for the price.
My daughter loves it:)
Works as advertised. Great color and picture. Good sound and very fast.
Tremendous device for the money.
"Parental control, especially for kids over 8 absolutely terrible- no ability to set time limits... Still, it is a good device otherwise."
My son loves it. I have an early version and it is used an average of 4 hours a day.  Pictures are vivid and the charge is longlasting
Great
"My Daughter loves her kindle.  It is great for movies, music and much more."
"Works great, nice picture and good sound.  Wish it had a Google Play store option or option to download Google apps."
"It is a tablet.  It is hard to modify the screens and delete things you do not use/do not want.  The Email app is terrible and I will not be using it.  This device is excellent for reading books, news, watching movies and searching the web.  These functions are great and work well. Shopping for books and other things is easy on the Fire.<br /><br />If all you want to do is read a book or access the news the fire is as good as anything out there.  This device is not for work."
I guess I didn't understand you had to have an internet connection. But when I do its pretty good item. Speed is OK for what I need.
"I got the 8gb which was obviously a HUGE mistake. We only have 4 games downloaded and have no storage left. No pictures, books, or anything."
I like the Kindle Fire 7 but I was disappointed in the quality of the photos I took.  Otherwise I am happy with it.
I need a manual but I'll figure it out. I do like it.
"Great little tablet, especially for the price. Can't beat it.  I bought for my son's 5th birthday. It does pretty much everything my 11 year old's iPad does, but cost me 75% less than the iPad did.  Parents should choose this over the iPad every time."
Needed a direction booklet ...a how to do booklet
"Fast great tablet.  It moves around the internet great, and the apps get the work done I need."
Loving my new kindle.
Love it!!
I love it!
It's a great piece of fun. You can do anything with it.
I was not satisfied because I have not yet received the accessories that were supposed to be included 👎👎
I am really enjoying this tablet. Seems to work great. I am used to Android tablets but this one seems very easy to use. It seems very responsive. I have prime and like using it to read my kindle owners lending library! The sound is louder than my Nexus 7 was. I have only had it a week - but like it so far!
It awesome
"really not happy with this purchase at all; will be returning it.  First reading books on it is far from comfortable, it is not easy to hold in your hand, weighs too much and tires out my hand and wrist quickly.  I do not like the way anything is set up on the device and actually find doing stuff on my android phone much better, much easier and better choices.  I don't see any real use for this device because you cannot do anything with it if you're not connected to a Wi-Fi service and therefore is less useful than my cell phone for retrieving maps or other info. while not at home or on another Wi-Fi service.  And then if I'm just using it at home or at a hotel I have my laptop for that which is WAY better than this Fire thing is to use.  Not worth the money unless you actually plan to be stuck on a plane or anyway for long periods of time and want it to watch movies on, otherwise stick with the laptops and phones!"
"My kindle fire, of which I have 3 and my husband has 1. Is more awesome than I could have ever imagined. My husband bought my first one for my birthday. I didn't touch it for about a year. My husband finally threatened to get rid of it if I didn't start using it. I had my daughter in law show me the basics. I must admit, I was intimidated about using it. After learning the bear minimum. I started exploring. It was so easy to figure out how to use it for my needs. From that moment on I never put it down. I use it for everything. I take it everywhere. I use it for work, using my email and looking up information on Google. I use it to look up interesting facts about people places and miscellaneous things. I listen to music on it I watch movies on it. I play games and purchase from it. I received a competitors Ipad for a gift. Boy am i glad my first one was the kindle fire. I wouldn't have realized how truely wonderful it was if I wouldn't have received  the other one. I would have just thought they were all great. Not so.  Everything about it is so much more functional than the other one. In my humble opinion you gays made a winner."
"It was a gift, never seen so many casino games down loaded by one person, LOL!!!"
"This is a wonderful device.  I purchased one (the second one that I have owned) for myself  and one for my sister.  We both love them!!  Excellent, handy device for the price.  Would highly recommend these."
Very easy to use and lots of apps for it.
"Easy to use, good battery, and all around good quality"
Perfect little handy gadget!!!! Takes great pics too!!! EZ to use
Great Product
"Ordered it Saturday afternoon and received it on Monday, Memorial Day. This was my third Kindle. Same great quality but with a lot of new update. Well  worth the money."
My husband loves his.
Decent tablet. Limited apps. Great if ur more into Amazon app store. Not compatible with many android apps.
"Amazon's Fire HD 7 not only is an marvelous and wonderous apparatus which includes a amazing plethora of sophsticated electronic communications, entertainment and E-book components ingeniously compressed into one small, light-weight, handsome, easy-to-use device, but also an incredible value.  It is with the utmost enthusiasm that I highly recommend the Amazon Fire HD 7.  The remarkable Amazon Fire HD 7 brings a smile to one's lips, and a spring to one's step!"
"Purchased this for my wife's birthday. She loves it. Whether is for reading or game playing, her Kindle goes with her everywhere she goes."
"I am not that into this device. It looks nice and built-in apps such as Shopping (of course!), Books, Prime, etc., work really well, but most everything else is no more than mediocre. Particularly dismal is the app store. That alone can sometimes make the damn thing feel useless. For the price, however, and to be fair, it works fine. I'll take it for now. And that should be its slogan: &#34;Fire HD 7... I'll take it for now.&#34;"
This is my second Fire HD 7 inch pad.  It has some improvements over my first one.  It has a front and rear camera which will enable me to Skype.  It had good resolution and is easy to use.
I absolutely love it!!!
I am very disappointed. Mostly a blank screen. I didn't check anything re child protection but it said I did and couldn't get it off the screen. I don't do Facebook or Netflix so it is not very useful. I received it as a gift from my son and I am having him return it to you. My smart phone works just fine
Love it .....
loving my tablet
Great product!
I find the HD 7 to be very  useful specifically when going for medical appointments. It fits easily in my handbag and holds all of my favorite apps.
"IMO it is the best value tablet you can buy.  I purchased the original Kindle Fire years back and it didn't disappoint, but the new and improved Fire HD 7 is elite.  I know they have tablets with keyboards and all other sorts of gadgets, but you pay like you are buying a laptop.  The Fire HD 7 is VERY reasonably priced and does it all.  I surf the web, play tons of games, and read on mine and I couldn't be happier.  I'll continue to buy from Amazon in the future."
Love it
"All is good it just will not turn on at times needs to be rebooted, This should be addressed"
Excellent
Love my kindle Fire!!
love it
"Replace my first kindle fire, which was the color first version.  Like some of the new features like color options for highlighting, and font choices.<br />One thing which I miss is I used to be able to highlight two consecutive sentences and leave the space in between them not highlighted, to remind me I was highlighting two separate ideas.  The new Fire will not do that.  Any adjacent sentences which are highlighted separately have the space between them highlighted also."
The only negative thing that I can say about Fire HD is that I hate the on/off slot. I wish the item was a button. There are times where it is difficult to find the tab to turned the device on/off.
Love it.it's great for watching tv.also love the camera.
Really like my Fire. I travel a lot and bought it to download all those free Amazon Prime shows and movies and has paid for itself already now having to buy shows on iTunes so much.
"So far I really enjoy my Kindle fire. I have problems with the search feature. And apparently I have too slow a connection to view movies. This was not the case with the first several movies I watched, so I will investigate that further. Other than that, I enjoy it very much. What I got fot the price I paid is absolutel amazing!"
It completely met all my expectations. I am enjoying it.
"Poor battery life, even with screen at lowest readable setting and keeping internet off unless needed, only 4 to 5 hours of life in battery. Liked 1st generation better."
Great better than expected.
I L O V E this tablet.  It is GREAT!  I'm soooooooooo glad I purchased it.
"just one problem  me  Iwill be 82 this summer abd having trouble understanting itand directions,  it was a mothers gift from all my children as I am having problesm with eyesight.  donot want to hurt their feeloings  as they thought it would help me read books and muy bible.  can I return it  thank you for your help.  joan uppendahl"
Love  everything  about  it....
I was charged for the music I wanted.  I was on a trial 30 day prime customer.  It was very unforgiven  I accidently added a hip-hop station.  I couldn't  remove it from my device.  I returned it within 3 days.  I still have to pay for the music. I'm not happy at all.  I bought a new tablet and I'm happy.
It's everything we hoped it would be...
Live it! Only disadvantage is that it doesn't have a &#34;home&#34; button
sweet
"How in the world does the kindle tablet get so many good reviews?!  We have had probably 4-5 (lost track) kindle tablets replaced due to technical problems. I never wrote a bad review because amazon always took care of the problem under warranty. The last one I had to pay to replace because it broke after the warranty expired. $220 and 1 year AND 1 MONTH later, here I am AGAIN having to pay to replace it. Of course I've finally learned my lesson and am NOT going to replace it. Hello Apple!<br /><br />I am a huge Amazon shopper and normally love it. The fact is that they do not offer any kind of repair service and only 1 year warranty. Never had problem 1 with my Paperwhite. This tablet is just a waste of money."
Just not as easy to use as my Galaxy. It's not bad but not my favorite.
I use my kindle everday and I love it
No instructions came with the Fire HD7.  I cannot find anyone who has one who can show me how to make it work.
I am still trying to figure out how to delete books from my Kindle.
"Love my fire 7 Kindle.  Being of the elderly generation, I love to read  The performance in this Kindle is amazing.  I have, as yet, discovered all it can do.  Looking forward to learning more."
Updated withthis new fire and love it
Excellent to use for books and movies.
It's Great
"I loved my Kindle Fire 6&#34; but this new Fire HD 7 is awesome, did not include any special offers except for the price of $139, has so much more than my original Kindle has, I am giving my Kindle 6&#34; to my 4 year old grand daughter for her story books and games."
I have the original Kindle Fire.  The battery has always been a little touchy charging.  I would have to move the cord around to get it to charge.  Now it won't charge at all and Amazon tells me that they can't do anything because my warranty is over.  I should have read the other reviews and sent it back right away.  This is a manufacturing issue and Amazon won't stand behind their product.  Customer service is not helpful.  I'll not replace this one with a Kindle and plan to cancel my Prime membership because of the poor customer service.
"Kid proof, love it! Very pleased with this product and my other kindle fire we own."
A little heavy to hold; get the standing leather case
"Do you know that commercial with the lady who leaves the Kindle on the car and it falls off?  And the Kindle is not broken?  Well, I dropped my Kindle while carrying it in the garage, and the casing started separating and the screen ended up cracked (not sure if this happened during the fall or during the repair to the casing).  The crack is in a corner outside the viewing area, so it's still usable.  I do like this smaller, lighter version for travel as it fits into a very small purse that I use for commuting.  At least I don't have to worry about this Kindle being stolen because it's cracked and we picked it up at a discount.  I have 3 Kindles, and this is the first one to suffer damage, but I have always kept the others in a case.  The immediately prior version seems a sturdier version than this one, but it's also larger so isn't as easy to squeeze into a small purse.  I wish more &#34;skins&#34; were available for this model because I don't want a bulky case as that defeats the purpose of having small Kindle for commuting."
"I enjoy the wide variety of content, but it would be nice not to have an add pop up EVERY time I turn it on.  I also wish there were ways to group the books in folders or by content.  The device has wonderful applications, but it's sometimes hard to figure out how to do what I want."
I love it other then it freezes up some timesfor no reason n restarts not sure how its any different then my old kindel
"Great tablet. My whole family uses it. Doesn't freeze or glitch out. I use it to pay bills on. Surf the web. Watch Netflix, and so much more. I just wish there was a flash for the camera."
I lost my other one and had to order it because I use it daily.
Great product for the price!
I love my Kindle Fire. It is easy to use and read.
The HD is the best i have everseen on a screen.
Love it although I think the kids free time app is a little pricey for what you get.
Be warned: you will be buying a commercial flashing tablet. I bought these for my kids because I liked the parental controls but my kids are exposed to bared women video game advertising as soon as the turn it on! What's your problem Amazon connecting the dots?
"I bought this on sale for my husband and all I can tell you is that he loves it. He listens to classical music when he is working, he watches shows on Netflix, he checks his e-mail, etc. Plus it is small and easy for him to carry around or put in his pocket so he can hear music as he works. We (my daughter and I) laugh because he enjoys it so much. Best bit of money I've spent on him in years!"
My husband loves his birthday gift.
I can't figure out why more people don't own one of these.  It's so easy to use.  Set up in less than 5 minutes.  Love the Amazon Kindle Family!
So far I have enjoyed all aspects of the HD 7.  I have not read on it outside yet but hope it can be managed.  Have not found a cover for it yet.  Any suggestions?
Great tablet first one I have bought
Best tablet on the market
"Its my first tablet and it is awesome.  Its super user friendly, has tons of space and there is an app that allows me to interact with Microsoft excel.  Lets be honest though... I just use it to Skype with my parents and surf the net so its just what I need."
Really good price and  perfect for carrying around. Will shop again. Thanks.
Great quality
"and the inly reason i gave them one star because i can't give them a zero.this product and amazon are crap. The product died on me without having it be my fault, When I contacted amazon they wouldn't give me a replacement when their product was at fault, And gave me the complete run around. I will never recommend this product or this company a second chance. they are idiots and have their head up their asses, and I have multiple friends and family have the same problem and was not give &#34;fair&#34; customer service."
"I've been a Kindle user since the first reader. This is my  second Fire.  The Fire is a good tablet.  It is every bit as good as the units my daughters use by other manufacturers.  However,  I have a couple issues:  I'd like to see a more stable screen that doesn't flip between landscape and portrait at the slightest motion, and the charge connections are weak.  I had to return the first Fire because the connection became so loose it wouldn't charge at all, and now the new Fire is already starting to act up.  Other than those issues I think the Fire HD is a bargain and does everything a tablet should do."
its heavy should come with a handle.
"I just love this tablet...I read books, magazines and newspapers. Check Facebook and emails and I love watching Netflix!"
Don't know why changed on/off button and volume button. Liked old way better. Thanks.
It meet more then my expectations
It's very convenient and I love toting it around. Not too big. Durable but I plan on getting a case for it. Lot of use out of it just wish they had better games.
My niece absolutely loves her Kindle!
Being new to this part of the electronic world the &#34;device&#34; is everything we expected.  My wife and I both now have one.
"It is for young people who are computer savvy. I wasn't able to make use of many of its functions and there was no printed handy manual. 7&#34; is too small for my need and the screen is LCD which puts stress on the eye. What I would have liked is another, yet functional, DX with &#34;white paper&#34; screen. But Amazon has abandoned the DX model. There is an HDX for Kindles Fire, but this has the same problems. I decided to let go of e-books and stick with old fashioned print books. They are pleasure to use, easy to go through the different sections, and have page numbers and indexes. I am waiting for a smart company who can duplicate this kind of reading experience. When this happens, I'll retain to e-books."
It fits perfect. I love it.
It will never replace my real computer but it's lots of fun to play with!  I'm only working with one game right now. but plan on branching out later. As it was a gift to me I have no complaints whatsoever.
Nice tablet for the money. My 5 year old loves it!
"The Fire HD is a significant bump up from the old Kindle Fire, and it seems to work very well.  Definitely worth the price."
I really like the fire because it is easy to see and makes reading very enjoyable.
No complaints.  Does what I expected it to.
Love my Kindle.
"great kindle fire! I'm enjoying using it--very user-friendly. some things are different than my older 8.9HD fire, but it's basically the same. I'm happy!"
Is perfect case
I love it
"Awful...<br /><br />Keep losing wi-fi connection...<br /><br />It's not my router either, as my iPhone works with wireless, flawlessly.<br /><br />Disappointed, as the sound quality is good.<br /><br />Will be returning this device."
I liked the speed of it. I would give more stars if I bought the 16g. Nice that some of the fire tv apps can play on it.
Love it!
How can I go right to the home page when I turn it on instead of having to log in that 4 digit shopping code? That really bugs me.
I totally love my fire tablet it lets me expand my horizons it's now my constant companion.. Best decision ever.
Still getting used to it.  Learning. Am a slow learner. That's.'s for asking.
Bought this as a gift for my mom she loves it
"I wish I could have given it even less than 1 star.  I am very unhappy with this purchase and think I will return it.  I like to read with the page in the vertical format (i.e. portrait) but in this kindle the text keeps slipping over to landscape or horizontal format even when I hold it absolutely still.  And it keeps rapidly falling into landscape at a dizzying pace, over and over again.  There is some defect or bug in this design because a little circle keeps spinning around in the middle of the screen while this is happening, and the text is constantly flashing by in landscape format.  DO NOT GET THIS KINDLE.  I had an older Kindle Fire which I absolutely LOVED (it was one of the very early Fire models), but sadly left it behind in a hotel room in Brazil and had to get another one to replace it.  This Fire HD7 is an absolute NIGHTMARE to try and read from.  Save your money and stay away from it!"
Love it was a gift and ordering case for it but a lot faster and best gift I have ever got love mine
"It was a fantastic purchase!! I love the carousel, and the camera is easy to use. I have a quick access to messaging my friends.<br /><br />The only thing that I'm very upset with is that you cannot access the Google play store. There are many apps I could not use without the play store that I use to absolutely love using on my Nook tablet.<br /><br />That is my only regret on getting this. You cannot get all the fantastic apps you had on Google play. I so much hope that the Kindle Fire company ever so kindly will let us gain access to Google play once more.. I miss it oh, so much."
Get table for the price.
I bought this for my husband and myself and when we first got it we could not get on to use it.  Then my daughter was able to set it up for us finally<br /> so we were able to use it and loved it.  Then all of a sudden it went off and we can't get back on again. We have tried everything and it will not work.  I am extremely disappointed and am ready to send it back.
It was waste of my money. The case was backwards with the connections inputs opposite from where they should be. The shield appeared to be used because the gluing side was very dirty. I threw th away
"works great, lots if power,  wish it had an expandable sd card ability"
I really like it
Flat on my back with a blown disc.  The Kindle was a the perfect thing to relieve my boredom and stay connected.
"We bought one each for my 9 & 7 kids.  For the price, it seemed the best touchpad choice and it hasn't disappointed.  They have been able to play games, listen to music, and watch shows on them.  My daughter dropped hers and the casing popped open but since I had also purchased the warranty package we received a new one within two days, hassle free."
"Product works well and the kids love it. However, it seems to get hot and battery loses its charge faster than the previous model. It takes some getting used to the controls."
"Pretty solid e reader here. Decent selection of other apps and is just the right size to not be overly cumbersome. The interface is a bit odd and some of the menus aren't as intuitive as you would expect. Other than that good value for your dollar. I'd say that one of its best features is it's battery life. One charge a day will last you all day whether you are reading, gaming or video chatting."
Not sure why Amazon thought they needed to change the model. Really don't like the plastic back.
I love it!
Love my Fire HD!!
It is birthday present for my wife and she loves it
"I love it, easy to use"
I like it! For the price is a great option and worth having Amazon Prime with this device.
It is amazing maybe a better charge port and battery
Love it!!
"It has performed very well, exceeding my expectations"
"Got this item  for my daughter, she absolutely loves it. Best gift I have ever given, thanks to amazon!!#"
Great. Thanks+++++++
I love the new Kindle Fire.  We had the original Kindle which we liked but the new one seems to be clearer and faster.  My favorite new feature is I have a subscription to Audible and the Kindle HD 7 will play those books and has a timer so you can have someone read to you as you fall asleep!
Nice reader
"I love my kindle!! Pretty easy to use. Love being able to read books on this. I can read books on any website I want, or get them off of amazon."
Works good but poor battery life.
love the Fire HD bought another  only and 8&#34; this time. Gave the 7&#34; to grandkids.
Battery runs out faster than expected
Great product. Hit our expectations on every level
"Great little macine. Love the software  that came with it. It charges  up really fast, too. Couldn't have done  better."
fast shipping.  this is my third Kindle because my son has broken the other two.  I purchased the protection warranty just in case....I'm hoping it won't be needed.
"Love my HD Fire. Easy to handle, no problems learning how to use it. Easy to download all my books and games."
"I sent for a manual that hasn't come as yet.  I'm having trouble transferring all my books from my old Kindle to the Kindle<br />Fire.  Not all of the books transferred.  There are other thing this Kindle will do but, I can't figure out how to do them so I just go back to my old Kindle and read the books I have left to read."
Love my new Fire!
It's the perfect size. I love the display and ease of use.
Amazing!!!!!! I love him!
"Great product at an affordable price. I own a Paperwhite also, just for reading e-books of course. I wasn't intended to read on this tablet, but there would be no problem to do so. It's fast, has a wonderful clear display, I can use most of the apps I often use in my phone but in a bigger screeen.<br />I got advantage of a discounted price from Amazon, and I was noticed of it by ads in the other Kindle.<br />The battery lasts about 2-3 days in a regular use, the app store is wide, it has a lot of free well-known applications.<br />The only disadvantage, if I could say, is its weigh. But it's just a detail, not so important. On the other hand, that makes this tablet to be seen as a solid well-constructed unit.<br />I sincerely recommend it for general purposes like email, Skype, social networks, movie streaming, browsing, etc."
Great kindle!
Above and beyond.  Bought for myself but it looks like I'll be giving this one to one of my grandsons.  He hasn't been able to put it down.  He has been able to play games that he couldn't with his older Kindle.
I am very Happy with my kindle fire 7. It runs smoothly and has long battery life.
Awesome! My son loves it!
"Compared to my smartphone, the kindle fire hd is less functional. My smartphone does everything the kindle for does, only better. Plus a smartphone doesn't require an extra connection to the internet by way of WiFi. In my opinion the requirement of WiFi holds back the kindle fire. I will admit that the larger screen is a plus over a smartphone, but not enough to justify the purchase and additional cost."
"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, because he was always borrowing my Fire.  He loves it!"
So far it is wonderful.  This is my 4th kindle and I am hoping this one lasts longer.
Very happy with my new Fire HD.
It is an excellent pad - I love it.
Great tablet..... better price...
I love it!
Excellent thank u
Love it!
Love the kindle fire 4th generation! I couldn't have asked for a better product for $99.00.
"I simply love this kindle. I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for her to do school work on as well as apps and games. The interface is so user friendly and I love the parental controls, it makes me feel very safe about what content my child sees. It also has &#34;free time&#34; app built right in so there is absolutely NO arguing about when she can be on and for how long...I can set the limits for her. Having an autistic child, this makes all the difference in the world. I highly recommend this product."
Love my new. Fire HD 7. The speakers are all they promised with great sound/as is the clarity of movies. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
"I absolutely love it. The volume is louder than my iPhone so I can play Pandora while in the Kitchen cooking or I can watch Netflix while cooking. The selection of books is great, especially if you are a prime member because you can borrow books just like a library without having to buy them. Plus, looking st social media such as Facebook and Twitter is easier. I am a little disappointed that Instagram did not have an app for Kindle users. I also love looking at my CNN app and USA Today app on the Kindle. It is great to use to search the web. I didn't always like using my iPhone to do internet searching because some sites exclude certain things since you are using your phone, but on the Kindle, it pulls up the full website. That way, I do not have to boot up my unwieldy laptop. I also love checking my email on it because it is so much better than on  my iPhone. Plus, if the email has attachments such as documents and picture, you can save those things onto your Kindle. I am a coach and have a ton of documents saved onto my Kindle that way I can easily access them without having to scroll through my email history to find that particular email, plus I can print form this to my printer through wi-fi. You can also type up your own papers on this because it has a very similar version of Microsoft Word. I got this for my mom on Mother's Day, but we share it. Therefore, you can have two separate accounts and each account can have its own password. That way we each have our own privacy. It is just like a computer where you can have two different accounts. Anyway, this was a steal because I only got it for like $120 for 16 GB and it was the newest Fire HD 7. The packaging was great. It arrived on time. It is also easy to set-up because they take you through it step by step. I can't believe I got this for such a great price, considering the great quality and all that it does."
This tablet has exceeded my expectations. I am very happy with it.
"Video and pictures dont rock. Sometimes locks up and has to be restarted. But, the ebook features and movies rock!"
"I'm still learning about all of it's apps, but am enjoying what I know."
Very pleased with my kindle purchase.  It arrived ahead  of estimated delivery.  I can do everything  on it as I can my laptop.
Just what I wanted.  Lost my first one and wanted to replace it.  Perfect
Love this gadget! Does all my iPad did at a fraction of the cost!
"Honestly, unless you're looking for a device that's buddy buddy with amazon's kindle books, music, and video this thing kinda sucks for an android tablet. From a hardware perspective it's okay, but amazon's app store leaves little choice and most of the apps are useless and even out-dated. Amazon's keyboard stinks, it's slow and constantly collapses in the middle of typing, often forcing me to re-open the app. The silk browser is just as midbendingly awful. It too is slow, only let's you open 8 tabs, doesn't function with plugins etc, and of course, amazon's app store doesn't even have firefox or chrome. The notifications suck, the only way you know you have a notification is by going and rolling down the top bar. The only way i even got by using this thing was when it was rooted, but now that is impossible because amazon's ADB is incompatible with windows 8, and a forced update undid my root.<br /><br />I'll give it 2 stars for being a kindle, it does that just fine, but so does the paper white. This thing just makes a horrible tablet, which i assume is amazon's intention (competing with google's android tablets and apples ipads)."
Does more than expected - absolutely love it!
Love it!  Great improvement over the original Kindle Fire that I had.
Purchased as a gift and it was a huge Mothers Day hit. Only wish i had gotten it for myself instead of the 6&#34; i ordered a month earlier for the same price.
Great electronic!  I am still learning but I like it very much.
Love this product.  Great reader and I'm having fun discovering it's other uses as well.
"I am loving my new kindle fire!!!! I am so happy it has a front and back camera, the last one I had would only take selfies and I don't do selfies. I like taking pictures and now my kindle fire is an extra camera. I am loving everything about this product and finding new things about it more and more."
"1) the 4th gen you cant stream to your hdtv without a $25 adapter. 2) there is no micro hdmi plug on the hd 7 7&#34; 3) hooks to my wireless printer nicely 4) VPN could work better. 5) it is faster than my KINDLE 7 6) google app side loading may or may not work. 7) Mobimail works on it but will not sync your Outlook, gmail folders and sub folders in any kind of alphabetical order and when you have as many folders and sub folders not being in order kinda sux. 8) office suite pro 8 is just great!  So all in all im happy I suppose ... oh and nice definition."
"I liked my old Kindle Reader better because it was easier to archive books that I had already read.  The Kindle Fire shows all the books in my library, and I haven't gotten a clear answer on how to keep them from appearing in the &#34;books&#34; section of my device.  The battery life is also shorter even though I have it on airplane mode and have the wi-fi turned off when I am just reading books that I have downloaded."
This is an awesome product. My 6 year old loves it.
"I liked the old Kindle batter, easier to use and I don't need all the rest"
loving it!
"This is an good tablet for the price. Some apps are glitchy but I owe that to the android operating system. The display is great, processor is kind of slow when downloading in HD and steaming, compared to iPad tablets, but again - this is way cheaper. The sound is excellent and the battery life is also great. I really don't like that the tablet is set up to market to you CONSTANTLY. There may be a way to turn off the constant advertisements and  &#34;suggestions&#34; that I don't know of, and I totally get what they're trying to do, it just gets annoying. Maybe for the money this is the trade off? Anyway, I like the device."
"So far, it has been just what I wanted."
it is all good
Very good.would recommend to anyone.
"I love my Fire HD, it is perfect for travelling!!. It hold magazines & books for me to read while I am flying. It holds pictures for me to show to friends in a nice sized screen. I can also play my silly games while waiting for my next flight. This is absolutely perfect for travelling!"
The screen is so readable just like my Kindle that I read books on. This is my second tablet and much better than my Android. The response is so fast and download is amazing.  This really lives up to the Kindle tradition that I've loved for many years.
"Nice tablet for reading , adequate for wifi net surfing<br /><br />Runs a bit hot with continuous use.<br /><br />Battery life and recharge time adequate<br /><br />Good buy at $99"
Very good and fast delivery !
"I like it, other than the ads, which I am not going to pay to have removed.  Also cannot get some of my favorite games (Candy Crush Soda).  But it is fun and easy to use and a great price!"
"Absolutely love it....wish directions were a little clearer, but think once I keep reading the user's guide it will get easier, or I will contact the Help Desk.  It is so much better than a laptop....LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT."
"Best choice I made when looking for a tablet. Does what I needed it for and a lot more, got my moneys worth."
Great kindle.meets all my needs and wants.
"I was so excited when I first got this. I had a few problems at first with it but it wasn't a super big deal. The only real problem I have with it is how the prices for books are still pretty high. I bought this hoping to get a bigger discount on books and wasn't really happy with the prices. Overall a good product, but maybe bring down the prices a bit?"
"I haven't had any problems with, great picture and sound. The battery is also very impressive"
done
Love my new Kindle! I am impressed with how it reads in full sunlight and the ease of use.
"Works flawlessly. Bright, sharp picture, good sound, no disappointments here."
Yes it did  it's great think you
Great!
Awesome
I got this for my 16 year old daughter as an upgrade from her current Kindle.  She loved it.  The camera is a great addition so is the color.
i love it  but still have a lot to learn about how to navigate it  any help would be appreciated
"This is not my first time to the kindle rodeo!  I got my first kindle for a christmas present when they first came out.  It is so easy to use for the types of activities i use a tablet for.  But alas, after years of heavy use, that one died. Then, i needed to buy my sister a tablet, and this is what i got her.  Setting it up for her made me see how more streamlined the process is now. The images of video are amazing, perfect size also to hold if you have hand pain issues. When I had her's in my hand, I knew right away that i needed a new kindle too, so thankfully mothers day was just around the corner, and ta da!!!!  I now have my own new one too.  I love it.  I know you will love it too.  And especially if it is for the more computer newbie, (yes, they still exist) or you are going to let kids play with it, because it is so straightforward in getting into things. (unlike the nightmare HP Windows version tablet i had bought first for both my sister and i just a few months ago.  I think i threw mine threw the window i hated it so much. My sister who is computer illiterate couldn't figure it out at all. But now??? SOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy to have a KINDLE FIRE AGAIN!) oh, and so is she!"
I am very pleased with my Fire HD and have absolutely no complaints with it.
In general this is a good little tablet. I am disappointed that it isn't compatible with some &#34;android&#34; apps and I also should have gotten the &#34;no ads&#34; version. However the screen is very clear and the sound is great.
It was more than I expected it to be.<br />I<br />Need learn how to do all it will do
I really like my Fire HD it is more than I thought it would be movies show real good on it.
It has a great size display. I especially like the parent controls that it provides.
Easy to use. It looks nice
"This replaced my Paperwhite, which I loved and lost. Fire HD 7 was a great price. I'm pretty happy with it."
Love it...it's my second kindle and wish I could have bought more memory.
"I bought a kindle fire HD 7&#34; at Best Buy. I also bought an IPod Touch (no frills) for about the same cost. I was curious as to which was the better product. After 7.. yes 7.. failed fire hd tablets I have given up! It was always a problem with the charging port. I am not the only one to run into this problem. My daughter, grandmother, a couple of co-workers,and friends have all run into this DESIGN FLAW.I at least had the foresight to purchase the extended warranty otherwise a $200 purchase would have cost $1400. Now my kindle fire lives in a box in the top of the closet. You get what you pay for was never more apt. BTW...the IPod Touch? STILL WORKS!"
"I have been a Kindle girl since the day they released the original. My first Fire was an original Fire and I went with it from there. I chose to order this particular Kindle in the citron because I knew there are just too many black Kindles floating around my house (we're an Amazon family and there's about 5 Kindles in my home belonging to various family members).<br /><br />I love that with this newest version I would be able to sync to both my Nokia Lumia 1020 and my Dell Inspiron laptop making working a breeze. I work from home and run my own design company so being able to have everything right there is fantastic. I also love the front facing camera which makes Skyping with friends, family or my clients easier than ever.<br /><br />I have not one negative thing to say about Amazon or their Kindle products. I absolutely love the bright green that greets me each morning and the smooth user interface that makes my life so much easier than ever."
"Much better quality, however , camera where and how to find and use it..no instruction on how to use new features.  Way more comercials.  While playing games for any length of time it still freezes."
"After the first couple of months of owning the Kindle Fire HD (previous generation) I noticed that the device would shut down even though the battery was over 30%. I ignored this since it would happen infrequently, only once every month or two, so I was not sure what was going on. This issue is now persistent but I am a little over the one year warranty and according to customer service there is nothing that can be done. They also tried to sell me another Kindle but I don't see the point of buying a product that is going to be faulty in less than a year.<br /><br />I really enjoy the Kindle/Amazon experience but am disappointed by the reliability of this device. I didn't expect the product to malfunction so quickly. I regret to move away from Amazon but it seems the smarter option considering the life span of these devices."
This is a beautiful product and I have had zero problems so far. I just wish the covers weren't all sized specifically for one kindle over the others.  They can get pricey too $
my daughter loves it
"it says the battery will last 10 hours or something like that, i turned off wi-fi, dimmed the display, uninstalled running apps, i did everything to help the battery, i only use it to read books and the battery last maybe 3 to 4 hours, so yeah the battery maybe could last 8 to 10 hours like amazon says, but only if you turn it off and don't use it at all for those hours."
Love this tablet. the reason I got the 8 gig is because I don't really play a lot of games I just need it so I can Skype family. but for those who do get a kindle with higher gigs
"I don't know where to begin with this product review --- I love everything about the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; -- this is an amazing piece of technology.  I purchased it to read my huge library of books on, but it also has a phone and all sorts of other features I've just started to become accustomed to.  Highly recommend this product.  If you love to read books, or stream movies, this is the device for you.  The only thing is doesn't do is give me a back massage.  Or, maybe there's a button for that -- I just haven't found it yet.  NOTE:  There is a help button that really does help!"
Love it
I can't use the ABC t.v. app or hulu. I bought this to watch my favorite tv shows and to watch movies. not real happy:(
"Love it so far, bummer I had to pay to get rid of advertising on my kindle"
Very pleased with the new fire HD 7&#34;
"Bought this on sale, so it was quite the bargain. I use the Fire HD for its video features; Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, and TiVo. Very crisp, clear display. (My one complaint is that the screen is very reflective; the glare is bad in a brightly lit room. I wouldn't try to use it outside.)<br />I don't use this as an e-reader; I have a Kindle PaperWhite for that.<br />Speakers are good enough that I rarely bother with an external Bluetooth speaker. Appreciate that I can download Amazon videos for offline viewing. Wish I could do the same using the TiVo app (it's streaming only).<br />So, I'll continue to use my iPhone/iPad to download TiVo shows for offline viewing. But the Fire is a good little extra screen. Glad I splurged!"
Bought it for my Grandson he love it.
Beautiful book I just love it thank yo very much.
No have Google play fu chuqhskfhsjkkkkk laggggggggg<br /><br /> buy the nvidia shield
I love this thing...It has easily became my favorite tablet.
Perfect size for my bag. 8&#34; too big and 6&#34; too small. Functions as well as iPad and hundreds less.
Good doing business with
fabulous it is very easy to use and just fun
Excellent Service and Product!
"As a long time iPad user I was pleased to find just how well Amazon supported the Kindle fire HD with their own version of the cloud.  I used to use my iPad to revive images taken with my cameras, but the generic brand chip reader/USB connector was made incompatible when Apple decided to force you to use their proprietary connector.  With the Kindle fire I can connect either a camera, or just it's memory card and down load imagery for revive or manipulation and store them to the cloud... all pretty cool.<br /><br />Oh, it also makes a great book reader😂."
Great portable for travel
My fire goes everywhere  it all that I need.  Very bright movies are great. I may have some question I will get back soon. Thank you again.
I've had my kindle for almost 3 years.  Unfortunately it was included in the problems Amazon had with the power jack.  Sometimes it charges and sometimes it doesn't.  It being one of the originals it cost almost $300.  I want a new one but am still considering it because of the past problems.  I didn't purchase a warranty because I figured at the price they were they would be reliable.  Big mistake.
Let me start by saying we love this kindle but I am disappointed in the false advertisement saying this kindle is extremely durable because after 4 days of my son having it he dropped it from about 2 feet up and the screen cracked.
Great Sturdy product my kids love it!!
My husband uses it every day!!
Our second Kindle Fire... love their user friendly format...and their customer service is outstanding if you have questions or problems using your Fire. Best customer service and technical help I've ever had to use.
"I am currently on my 3rd Fire HD 7 in the last 6 months. The one I originally purchased in Nov'14 suddenly died in May'15. So I called Amazon customer service, and they sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, it is their policy to only send refurbished units under the 1yr warranty. When I received the 2nd Fire I noticed the battery was draining at an unusually fast rate even though I hadn't even opened any apps or anything. I was just trying to set it up, and I was losing about 1% every 2min. So I contacted customer service again, and they told me to reset it, and call back if I had another other problems. Well the following morning, my son played on the tablet for 1hr, and in that time the battery went from 100% to 74%. I called customer service again, and they once again sent me another refurbished Fire HD 7. Not only does this tablet lose charge of a rate of about 20% an hour, but a few of the apps in FreeTime stopped opening. The screen would blink, and then either go back to the home screen, or open a completely different app. I called customer service yet again, and they advised me to do a factory reset, which seemed to solve the app issue (at least for now), but did nothing at all about the ridiculous battery drainage issue. The main reason, I wanted to keep this tablet was because my son loves the FreeTime feature, and so do I. But I've had enough of them sending these crappy refurbished units with terrible battery life. I guess I will just get my son an Ipad mini instead. I have an ipad myself, and have never had any of these issues. I will NEVER purchase another kindle or fire...nothing but a hassle."
"The Kindle was exactly what I expected. I was told that it would be delivered as soon as it was available, with a delivery projection of three weeks later. It was delivered in about a week. Needless to say, I was quite impressed."
"It works fine and I like it, but I don't understand why people walk around with their noses buried in a phone or tablet all day. It's just not that exciting. Maybe it's my aversion to social media. It seems to be worth the $94 that I paid for it."
"The jury is still out on &#34;battery life&#34;...it seems to run down too quickly. Other than that, it is a great value!"
"It works exactly the way I want it to, for games, videos and reading."
Awesomeness
"Given as gift, very much liked, sad though, because my Fire HD has sound and a MIDI port and better sound - did not realize that this was taken away with addition of the new series or I might have hesitated to buy this."
Absolutely a great tablet!
I wish i was able to download google play apps
"Bright, clear display, has been reliable and familiar to anyone who owns another Android device or even an iOS device. Seems to handle doing a couple things at a time just fine. I like to listen to music or Police Scanner (yep, there are apps for that) from online seeders while using the web or dealing with email. Works as fast, realistically, as the connection will permit. VERY rarely freezes, which is good news. As a main computer, I would not trust it since there is no memory card slot to save your work just in case. But since you can back it up to the cloud, if you're mindful to do so, it's fine as the &#34;walkaround&#34; that does more more easily than a phone does but without the size and weight even of a web-book. The virtual keyboard is configurable so that if you touch-type, as I do, you'll do fine on it. It also has enough rez and size to not push what you're typing or replying to off-screen, as phones can do.<br /><br />The sound from its speakers is more than okay, for what it is. Clearly, it's much better from the headphone jack.<br /><br />There are apps at the Google store that it would be nice if they were available for the Fire, like Foodler, which I do use otherwise. It's not terrible on a phone, but it's not great and the web-version on the Fire, using Opera (the smart browser for small resource portables), is still a bit spread out for the screen. I'm sure there are many such instances of apps you're used to having on your other Android devices that you cannot get on the Fire.<br /><br />Also, if you have a Kindle, which I do, be aware that the only content that will auto-backup from Kindle to the cloud is that which you've bought from or originated from Amazon. This means, as you may surmise, that it won't also appear on your Fire if it's already on your Kindle or PC. You'll have to do that the old-fashioned way... with wires.<br /><br />The Amazon tablets and ereaders are all good at automatically updating if you set them to do so. In the event of any operational flakiness, simply doing a full power-cycle seems to solve the problem, if the device doesn't self-cycle to do the same, a nice trick that PC-OS based devices should learn to do.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of screen protectors. They tend to make the images look worse and can dull the display's sensitivity to your touch, neither of which is great, and they scratch and scuff very easily, sort of self-defeating. The screen here is extremely tough Gorilla Glass. It's very difficult to damage, and if you're worried about that, it's more likely to happen when NOT in use, anyway. Buy a case with a flip-over cover, as I did.<br /><br />The back is more grippy than an iPad is, which is good news. Oh, sure the iPad's metal pan construction is very cool and status-symbol-y, but that only matters if your boss tells you that's what you must have or if you're a snob. The Fire weighs less (than the mini), multitasks, costs less and doesn't soak you for apps, even when you do choose to pay, like Apple and their developers do.<br /><br />Besides, you can do all the Office stuff on Android with free app modules that you can do overpaying for an Apple or MS suite.<br /><br />Oh, and FLASH. Yep, things play properly on the Fire. The camera is okay. Nothing special, my phone's (Moto X) blows it out of the water in every way, but that's really not what the Fire is about. It's bright enough for everything but direct sunlight, the clarity and contrast are good for reading websites, you can alter the display to favor reading a book, and, in short, it works, doing what it should do at a price that makes people happy!<br /><br />It goes on sale pretty often, you can pay over a few months if you have a Prime memberships and if they're doing a promo including some Prime months, they get added to your account. Arrives ready for your acct or unaffiliated, your choice, in nice, simple sensible packaging.<br /><br />Android is becoming the default OS for many devices, including some recently released desktops. For most people, it's PLENTY of OS, it's simple, fast and doesn't tax hardware like WinOS or MacOS do.<br /><br />You can put parental limits on it and that is good for peace of mind with kids. Battery life is pretty good, enough to handle the airport portions of a trip, and it charges on any micro-usb power source.<br /><br />It's worth buying. You'll actually take it with you to use when you have a moment here and there, and if you're a kid or it's for your kid(s), it will MORE than do the job, and better than a phone does. They can text on their phones and do webby stuff and music on the Fire. Win all around."
I reaally like my new tablet I got the it for the cameraas and  I love them I can put  picturess on facebook of grandkids  now.
"Haven't had it long but works great and I love the HD display. I have had a Kindle Fire for years and went ahead and bought this one so I don't have to be without one ever! and I gave my old, still-working Kindle to my daughter. Love it and think it works great."
I have enjoyed reading on the Kindle.  It is easier and less cumbersome.  I only wish there were more books available from my public library!
I love it!
Amazing!!!
"I love my Kindle Fire.  I received a Kindle Fire as a gift 3 years ago, but it would not charge any longer, so I had to purchase a new one.  This one was deal of the day, so I was able to get it for a great price.  It took me a little bit to get used to the new style and I don't really like the adds when I first wake up my Kindle, but I can live that that, because I absolutely love the Kindle.  It is so convenient to use anywhere whether I am traveling for work or just waiting in the parking lot for my kids after practice.  I can put it into my purse and away I go.  I love to read and this is the most economical way to get my reading fix!"
Good price & product quick delivery- now if my husband would learn how to use it!
It was great!  Exactly what I wanted.
"Love the lightweight, sharp HD and text-to-speech feature."
"no instructions come with it have very hard time to do any this with it , ask Daughter and most kids know all about electronics , and she is 34 old but does not know any thing about the kindle and nor do I . Trying to get into the new world and work with these new Electronics instead of watching the world go by, Please advise on help"
Excellent
I plugged in the device at 10 a.m and now the time is 5 p.m but the percentage charged is still 60%
gift to grandchild
"Too hard to use, no instructions, how do you close programs or do they automatically close"
lots of fun to own-- my first tablet!!!!
Loved it until I tried to read outside and can't due to glare.
I love my new Kindle Fire.  I had an older Kindle which I loved for reading but my new one has wonderful features which I am learning to enjoy.  I especially enjoy the backlit screen so that I do not always have to find a light.
"I've purchased several tablets in the past and returned them because they didn't meet my expectations. The Kindle Fire is so responsive and very intuitive making it so easy to use, so basically no learning curve required. I appreciate Amazon's total customer focus and it shows in little things like making the original set-up easy because they use my information to auto complete most of the set-up. I also like that I can read my books on either the Fire or my Kindle reader. Highly recommend!!"
I can not get Firefox or Google chrome to down load on this. If any one knows how to make this happen please let me know. I like the android tablets a lot better.
fits great
So far so good
"So far vary happy, very good for the money!"
I'm really happy with the product.  The only negative is that I have to charge it everyday.
Brilliant!! The best gift for a techno savvy person.
"I got it for my 85 year old mom. Its light, its easy to use, its easy for her to see. It was a great purchase"
"Love it, love it, love it!"
"I greatly enjoy my Kindle 7 HD.  I especially like the idea of checking my email or surfing the web on a small handheld device.<br />The one thing I will say that I do not care for is the fact that most free games that I have downloaded required you to purchase extra time/lives/gold etc.  I downloaded free games, not free for the first twenty minutes games, or so I thought."
I bought this for my wife for her birthday so she can read ebooks and play solitaire and read her email while watching TV.  She likes it very much.  I should have gotten one for her a long time ago.
P.S.Amazon..these kindles are supposed to keep their charge for several hours...eight or ten..right?..mine was over 100percent five mins ago..it's already down to 95I'm just saying....
"Whatever you do, spend the extra bread to get the ad free version.  I get so many pop-up ads that the page I am trying to view is completely obscured.  (Bad form Amazon.)"
Great tablet.I bought it for my kids and they are enjoying it.
Works as expected
"Happy with my Fire HD 7. It's light, compact. Fast and easy to use."
I love my Kindle.
It seems more like a tablet
love it
Removable storage would be a great addition to the Fire but the newer model is much peppier than the original for sure!
Its my third one.  We love them.
great product !!!
It's an upgrade from the last kindle I have. Like the cameras front and back capabilities. It's faster and has better reception. Best of all I like the cover I brought for it. Light and easy to handle.
"Amazon needs to do something immediately about the sick, twisted &#34;RECOMMENDATIONS&#34; they are forcing their Kindle customers to view on their shopping screens. Amazon makes it UNAVOIDABLE to have to see vulgar, vile, lewd, graphic, CRIMINAL, CRUDE book covers and book titles that only child predators, pedophiles, and people who enjoy incest would want to look at or read. I have contacted Amazon several times about this issue and spent hours on the phone with their reps and received no help to remove inappropriate and unwanted content on my family's Kindle, and still have been told that there is nothing I can do about it. These are the current titles Amazon is recommending on my Paperwhite this weekend with graphic pictures of half-nude young girls in pigtails on the cover to go along with the following nasty titles:<br />- Stretching the Brat (young girl with pigtails on cover)<br />- Double Jail Bait Teamed (young girl with pigtails and school uniform on cover)<br />- Training Lil' Elise<br />- Moving a Little Heart (girl with pigtails and teddy bear on the cover)<br />- Spanked and Diapered<br />- Curves for Stepbrother (I don't even want to describe this cover to you)<br />- Angel's Enema<br />- Cream for Stepbrother (really?!)<br />- Nursing Nymphos<br />- The Marshall's Little Girl<br />and so many others, but that was just this weekend!<br /><br />And I assure you, I HAVE NEVER, nor has anyone in my household browsed or purchased books on these heinous subjects. I have young children, AND my Kindle is password protected.<br /><br />WHAT IS GOING ON WITH AMAZON THAT CUSTOMERS SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS?! If this kind of stuff was found on the average person's computer, they could probably be prosecuted for child pornography. THAT'S how bad it is. Yet, Amazon has no qualms about subjecting it's customers with families to this perversion without the option to block it. It's absolutely ridiculous!<br /><br />I've purchased about 5 Kindles or more over theyears for my family, and as gifts, and so many other items from Amazon. I am becoming SO disappointed and disgusted in Amazon due to this experience. It is obviously NOT a family-friendly company. I'm now sorry I bought my child a Kindle Fire because she now can't even browse books to purchase because I have to worry about her seeing sick perversions on their shopping page. There is no setting to block this; only to block recommendations on the home screen. What sense does this make? Their reps claim that is has to do with browsing and purchase history, but that CANNOT be accurate, because we DO NOT and HAVE NOT browsed or purchased anything of this seriously demented nature or anything even close. Their systems dept. needs to seriously find their problems and issues and deal with them, because this feels like harassment.<br /><br />I also wonder why Amazon would sell or push ANY material involving underage sex, incest and all other criminally-crude content. That alone has me shocked and sickened, let-alone forcing us to have to view these titles and graphic book covers just to visit the store to make a purchase of a normal book!<br /><br />This needs to be addressed. I've been contacting them about this for weeks now, but have been ignored. Their rep reviewed my prior book purchases, which are mostly sci-fi, suspense and thrillers and couldn't figure out why I was getting these recommendations. So her bright solution to this matter, was to tell me to &#34;browse a bunch of kids titles&#34; to get this to change. Instead of getting rid of these vile things or offering a way to block them for their customers.<br /><br />It's funny, Amazon can block something they won't allow in a review, or allow someone to &#34;report abuse&#34; in a review, and block it, but I can't do the same with their recommendations that are repulsive and border on criminal. I find the content they're forcing on me abusive, and they are a telling me that it's too bad; I have to deal with it.Like it or not. I guess it's more important for them to make money by promoting this trash at their customers' expense."
great size and fills the need that I intended it for
"My daughter dropped this on her first day using it and the screen cracked. She's only three feet off the ground.  I called to request another and they made me buy the warranty. Advertising this on commercials saying it could fall off a car roof and be ok, is false advertisement. Just be aware it really isn't as durable as they say."
"I love my new Fire. HD.  I am not a techie and can get movies, games, books, shop online and get my emails easily.  The only thing I don't like is with the games they lure you in and keep asking for money to keep going.  You should not post them as free when they are not."
Can't compete with my 4th generation iPad. Is as I expected it to be. Only reason I've bought it is for hearthstone app and its Amazon coins gimmick. Not much app in store that interest me. Although the hearthstone app have a warning that running it would slow it down but I see no slow down. Love it for the light weight and volume power.<br /><br />Sure am glad that it only cost me 99 bucks for a pretty sexy &#34;tablet&#34;. I would recommend on buying this though to any Amazon prime members to take advantage of prime offers especially on books!
This tab is very good. I like to watch movies read books etc.
As a person who only had the original kindle for the last 4 years and had it attached to my hip I'm loving my new kindle fire. I use my kindle probably 2 to 3 hours every day. My only complaint is my battery doesn't last as long as my kindle keyboard. Other than that I'm just waiting to get wifi at the house so I can really go to town with it!!!!
Awesome. Great value
Excellent
Very happy with the product.  I'm using it everyday.
used daily holding up well
"love it, perfect"
Decent. Crap for storage space.
"Great, great, great.  I was fortunate to purchase this kindle for $99 for 16gb."
Great tablet.  Our teenage grand child loves to read and after a lot of discussion she finally decided she would try it.  Now she loves it for reading.
The best
I LOVE my Kindle!  The camera and video recorder are simple to use.  It does need lots of light to get nice shots.  I find it simple to use and easy to read from.  Definitely worth every penny.
This fire hd 7 not available with 16 GB upgrade at time of offer.
I love it!
Perfect!
Really love Kindle products -- I keep buying them -- to upgrade -- to always have a fully charged Kindle.  This one is great too and very well priced.
Made all my friends buy one and those that didn't are waiting for another sale
It's ok
"Love it. Great light,sound,screen. The whole package I would recommend it to anyone."
Great tablet
"Other than the fact that it seems to lose it's charge a whole lot faster than my former Kindle Fire, I really like my Fire HD!"
tiny but powerful and fast. We are using it more and  more for Skype and other interactive work. Very inexpensive and a great value. Don't love the MANY ads that it likes to put up at every opportunity.
"What ever happened to good old fashioned instructions on how to use something? I hate to have to muddle through using a phone and computer to figure out what I am doing. I had thought it might be easier to read than the Kindle. It isn't. The screen is actually smaller. And, it weighs a ton."
"Excellent quality, exceptional buy! Reading books, playing games, checking email all on the same device is cool!"
Fantastic value<br />This tablet met all my expectations.It is everything stated in the offering.It is also the perfect size for travel.
I am happy with my Kindle Fire.
"This is my first tablet of any kind... and I love it!!  Have had about a month and found several books I've enjoyed immensely in the $.99 to $2.99 range.  I enjoy the free game apps too.  Since I also don' own a laptop, I've always wanted something handy and convenient to look up something on the internet that just happens to come to mind without having to go into the office and turn on the desktop!!  Lovin' It!!"
Perfect for my little reader.
I love my new Kindle! Got here super fast and is all I expected!!
Nice
So far so good!
have been way to busy to really use it. but when life calms down I know I will love it.
"I am very happy with my new fire. I have had a Kindle e-reader for years, and I'm sure I will stay with Kindle in the future."
"I find that I'm truely enjoying my Kindle HD 7. It's a great device to read on of course. I love having all of my favorite books at my finger tips. I also signed up for Amazon Prime. I a lot of the TV shows they have on there. Kindle HD 7 and Amazon Prime is a great combination. If you get a Kindle HD 7 table sign up for Amazon Prime. It's so worth it. 2 day free shipping, many TV shows and Movies to stream."
Luv it
"Ordered and received this at the end of February, now, the end of May and it won't even turn on. This was my third Kindle product and was excited for this one, but it is completely unresponsive...waste of money for a couple of months worth of use."
I love my Kindle!! I've had the first generation until recently and I'm just as happy with my Fire as I was with my original.
Thanks.
Kids love it! Better pic then the trio. Got another for one of my employees so he can read building plans.
"Bought for my husband's birthday and he loves it! He's disabled, so he doesn't get out much. He uses it every single day throughout the day."
I had rather have windows instead !!!
"Great tablet you guys got here. I was actually disappointed though, right out of the box I saw 2 dead pixels on the right side of the screen, very very small and not far from each other and took a picture. I had already been waiting for a tablet for quite some time so I very exited about getting this right before opening it. I still love it, and have invested some time and money into it, so i screwed myself for not mentioning this to customer service the moment I found the pixels."
"Just purchased this item. The Fire works great! It seems fairly easy to use. Is a great size for taking in your purse. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is really lacking in instructions and the directions on the device are brief and incomplete. It would have been good to have at least comprehensive information in a folder on the device. Sometimes things ARE NOT intuitive for some people who do better reading instructions. It has a totally different layout than other tablets. That being said, after about a day of fiddling with it, I figured out most things. Would I buy it again? Definitely! The Fire works great!  I LOVE this Fire! After getting the hang of the format, I have found this super easy to use and ultra convenient to carry. I was quite torn as to what tablet to get and read the reviews prior to ordering. I have had absolutely NO ISSUES with the Fire. I couldn't be more pleased."
Love this tablet !!
great  i love it
"Love my kindle fire,"
"I love my Fire HD. Great for reading, videos, and apps; easy to use."
Enjoying
"I got it for Mother's Day and I can't put it down, I read books on it, listen to music, play games, take pictures and video tape, and I'm still learning new things about my Fire. I LOVE it, and I highly recommend this product. It's worth every penny."
This is my second Kindle Fire and they just keep getting better and better.
Awesome tablet for the sale price!!!!
This work ok but not on my wifi. Only was able to connect to public wifi systems even though the server was the same. I ordered a replacement but it showed a delivery date of 7-23-2015.Two months! I canceled. I really wanted this but feel the wait is to long.
I like it.
love it
Would be nice if the screen were actually 8 inches.
having usual problem getting started but like everything so far
Happy with my Fire HD 7
Very good tablet
"Even though my first Kindle Fire is still working fine, I upgraded to the Fire HD 7 for the improved browsing experience and the cameras. I still use my old KF as my bedroom alarm clock and let the grandkids play games on it. This new Fire HD 7 works great for Facebook, Yahoo email and calendar, browsing, and streaming movies. Having front and rear-facing cameras is a big plus. The sound is really decent, in my opinion, especially if the Fire HD 7 is propped up against a solid surface such as a book on a cookbook rack/holder because the speakers are on the side but face the rear. I'm too cheap to buy a protective cover which allows the Fire HD 7 to be propped up. I expected to use the Fire HD 7 more as a tablet than a reader, and so far it is meeting my needs very nicely."
is a lot better than the previous one I like the camera
I used Fire HD 7 to replace my Kindle and to have a travel device that will allow me to access e-mail.  Very easy to use and plenty of screen space.
"Initially, thought it was a great price and product given the reviews, but too many advertisements and strings attached. It's not an independent tablet as I thought. Everything is tied to Amazon. It's also slow. Tracks everything."
Hubby can use it! Non tech husband can sit in his recliner and play games.
I really like this Kindle. It came on time and is simple to navigate. This was a good for this goal. Great for on the go. Fits in my purses and bags.
My son likes it so far
Love this kindle.  Does everything I want it to do
I love it.
So happy with my purchase.
Love my Kindle HD. My old one bit the dust and I really like the upgraded version.
Love it
It is a great little tablet.  Wish it had access  to more apps.  Handles well and has good processing speed.  Wonderful piece of equipment for 79 dollars!!
This is my first tablet and I am very impressed with it.
I bought my 69 yr old mom this and she loves the upgrade from the kindle reader. She's able to use it and enjoy but hasn't fully utilized the tablet features yet. I'm sure with time she will.
not enough free reading. .And won't let you go to other sights to get more.
"Battery does not last long.  Was trying to read book, audio started, could not shut off.  Tried to shut off Fire HD but audio continued.  On /off switch would not shut it off.  Had to finish book to get it shut off.  I like my old Kindle better."
"Bought the Fire when they were having a great deal, and I've since returned it. There were constantly lag-time issues that, at times, made it unusable (for example, just wouldn't load splash screens for third-party internet providers, thereby making it impossible to log in to the wifi service). Apps would freeze up, and several major apps were not completely compatible with Kindle generally. Don't get me wrong, for under $100 it's probably worthwhile for a kid or someone that doesn't actually want to get online regularly- but I prefer to save that money and will be putting it towards and iPad instead."
"love the fire! I used my sons ipad before and I enjoy it just as much, but now he wants to use my fire...lol"
Great product
"I have a thing for pcs and tablets, many, many of them. They range from the Nexus 7 and Nexus 9 to the Samsung 8.4, 10.5 and 12.2 S Pros. I also have both the Apple Mini 2 and Air iPads. The Fire HD 7 is a worthy addition to the group. Great display, good battery life, great Kindle reading experience (it has the Bookerly font and new rendering engine that my Paperwhite does not have yet :( ). Performance is fine with a decent amount of ease of use. As a Fire tablet it has the best interface to Amazon shopping of any device. Prime functions in Music and Movies are easy to use and the mail client although not the latest greatest is still very functional. For the price it cannot be beaten.<br />One feature it does have beyond compare is the included Washington Post app. Best news app on the planet!  For that alone it is worth the price.<br />There are some downsides resulting in the 4 star review.<br />1. I do have many items on Google Play Music and Books. Not here no how.<br />2. Amazon's version of android is heavily forked so the interface is a bit challenging.<br />3. Apps on the Amazon store are not always in sync with the Google Play versions.<br />4. Compared to the Apple and Samsung high end models costing a lot more the construction is plastic and a little thick.<br />But can it do what every other tablet does? Sure. It is also better than committing to higher pricing in the Apple App store.<br />For the price it cannot be beat and of course Alexa speaks highly of it."
I love my Fire HD 7.  The is the 2nd one i got.  The first one died 13 months after i got it.  One month out of warranty.  UGH  I couldn't do without it that is the reason for the 5 stars.  This time i was smart and got the square trade 2 year warranty..  Amazon would only give me a deal on a refurbished and I didn't want that.  So yes it's great but pick up a 2 year warranty just in case.
Love love love it!!!!!! It's great for games it's great for reading kindle books and it's great for taking pictures! It handles just right not to big and awkward !
Works great and is a nice replacement for my original Kindle
Great device
"I think the kindle fire 7 is a great device, powerful, easy to navigate, I love it!"
"Got this on sale, First time with one.Enjoying my time with it very much."
I am able to do much more on my new Kindle than on the old one I had.
"I love it!  I enjoy being able to read magazines in color and the touch screen is a delight.  I only had a regular Kindle before, so this is my first Kindle Fire.  I am very happy that I switched."
This is my first tablet glad I made the jump with Amazon. My fire hd7 is simply amazing. Great tablet worth every penny. All the functions are smooth. Keep the up  good work.
Love this Kindle
Worth the price. Perfect.
Ads that came with it are annoying.
"Got it on sale for $79 and love it! You cannot ask for more at that price. Just the right size and weight, pages load quickly, videos stream without buffering, sound is great, photos are crisp. Overall I am very happy with the Fire HD 7! For my needs it is perfect. The only improvement I can think of would be the availability of more apps, like in iTunes and google play, but not a must for me. HIghly recommend if you are looking for a simple tablet to check emails, browse the web and messaging."
Although quite basic in construction and design it is most functional and more than adequately protects the device.  The cover easily folds completely back allowing for comfortable holding while reading or placing on the treadmill at the gym.  Good value for the price and equal to the case I had for my first Kindle which is still in good shape.
We absolutely love our kindle!!!!
"Using it mostly as a paperwhite, but the discounted price made this extremely attractive.  I love that I can do all tablet functions on this as well."
"I bought this shortly after buying a very basic Ematic and love it.  It's a great size, and the processing is nice and smooth."
I got it for the wife and she love's it!
"I will be upgrading my iPad before I upgrade my kindle fire because I cannot get this one app to run on the fire.  Nor does the kindle run anything  based on Google play, so the alternative of downloading via 1mobile does not work either."
"Awesome! Light weight, super fast, and does everything my computer does. So happy."
Meets and exceeds my expectations
I love this! I've been thinking about getting one for some time and glad I finally got one.
"I absolutely love my Fire.  As a very senior citizen I enjoy the convenience of being able to e-mail, play games, check news and weather, and a multitude of other things all from the comfort of my recliner.  Most important - I love to read!!!!!!  I am a Prime member so have access to a great many books and it is so easy to download them onto my Fire.  An added plus - I live in an area with a lot of thunder and lightning storms.  I obey all safety rules and do not use computer, telephone, TV, lights., water etc. while storm is active.  Instead of sitting and staring at the walls I open my Fire and have access to all my programs and books.  Major plus!"
Love kindles! Wish I had got 2 at special price!
"I love my 2nd Fire, but the battery does seem to run down faster than my old one, which I got on day 1 of issue.  Still going strong, hope this one last as long.  Love the color and new home page."
love this! My other kindle wouldn't let me download movies from Amazon prime but this does. Perfect size for my grandsons to play gasmes and watch their movies also.
Meets and Exceeds expectations and ease of use.  Great value!
Awesome picture and functionality. Steal at the price point.
I bought it for my 17 year old. She loves it!
Mom loves it.
Cheap feeling plastic. Clunky UI.
Greal Kindle but &#34;special offers&#34; had to go and it was well worth the $15 to do so.
Bought this for my mother-in-law. Very easy for her. She's extremely happy.
Great device only problem I need Google play for some applications.  Get Scottrade and Citibank to create a Fire App
Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Has a hard time seeing and changing the background to black has been just great.  He uses it all the time.  I am thinking of getting one for me.
works great but does not have sd drive and memory is nearly full out of the box
This is my second Kindle and I find this new one to be excellent.  I also find it to be much easier to use than my older one.
I am reading more because of it! I have barely realized the ability of it.
I received the &#34;fire&#34; as a gift and it is fantastic.  I have so enjoyed using the fire.  Wonder why I didn't have one sooner.
"I like it. We use it for reading, and games."
I enjoy using it books at my finger tips. Read late at night with no lights on.
Love it. The enhancements and operating system are great for my husband who struggles with technology.
Great product would recommend to anyone as great value.
"While I'm still learning features on the Fire HD 7, I love the ease of navigating around.  For someone who is not high tech this is the perfect tablet."
I'm in love with my new kindle fire.
"This is my fourth kindle and best by far! Size, weight, clarity, speed, and ease of use make it my favorite."
I love it for my son.
"This was a great purchase. We had the original kindle fire, but the HD is much better."
Like.
A quality product. Keep up the good work Amazon. I'm gonna let the Tec review people trip all over themselves with the ins and outs. To me it's an In-Game and I'm winning. Love my Fire HD. I thank you.
Was a little dissapointed to find out 3 of the 8 gb was already used before I received it (system use I get it) 5gb wasn't enough for my needs. Had I known ahead of time I would have ordered one with a larger memory.
"Really great for entertainment. We bought our kindle for road trips/etc, and so far we've really enjoyed it. The reason it lost a star- I don't love some of the features as it's hard to personalize and when hunting for apps or games not only can you not search by age but when you download/look at one closer it spits you back to the top of the list again. Overall very pleased though."
Very compact and user friendly!
Great deal and an excellent replacement for my wife's original Kindle Fire. She was very happy with the new upgrades and the progress that Amazon has made to it's Kindle Fire lineup.
I am extremely pleased with my Fire.  The speakers sound great and the apps are easy to download.  Great functionality for a super price.
"I love my HD 7, and would highly recommend it to anyone!  Got one of the 1st kindles as soon as it was released, and have had several since - this is my absolute favorite however!  One suggestion:  would you Please consider adding an instructional pamphlet - millions of people would love you for this"
"Love it, love it, love it -- !!!  Some of the reasons I love this Fire HD -- love to read and have downloaded so many free books -- what I have saved on buying books equals getting the Fire HD free!  Can do my email, check out things on the web, get free apps and games -- take photos, pay my bills and do almost everything I do with my laptop -- it is well made and I especially love the size, making it easy to put in my handbag.  The display quality is as good or better than the other electronics in our home -- and comparing similar products on the market -- the price is amazing -- plus mine was on sale!  It's the last thing I use before falling asleep -- reading, of course.  I seriously do love it!"
I just wish the screen was a little larger
An answer to all my needs. Extremely versatile
Does exactly what it was advertised to do. Very pleased with it.
My son loves it!!!!
The super good special price on the 7&#34; enticed me to buy one even though I had bought the 6&#34; on sale a few months earlier.  I traveled with the 6&#34; and I loved it.  I watch Amazon Prime movies and TV shows when I travel.  The 7&#34; is better for this since it is a little larger! I also upgraded to the 16 gig.  More storage for long flight entertainment. I am headed to Europe this summer and the 7&#34; is going with me.
So far so good! My 7 yr old loves her new Fire! It does glitch from time to time. But restarting it seems to fix the problem.
"I love the new Kindle but I asked for a white one...not a black one. I told the guy twice. But, I don't feel like sending it all the way back! So I will keep it."
Works great and I am using it every day with no issues.
It works good
Gift for the wife she love's it
"Still adjusting to my Fire, but I think I am going to enjoy the convenience of the size and features."
Love it!
Extremely disappointed in the camera. Picture quality is very poor and it was a major factor in deciding to upgrade.
"not bad, i have enjoyed it. but i still prefer to use a laptop at home..... i see some advantages for this, but  not alot.  if not for the huge sale/discount it had when i bought it, i would not have gotten it"
So far it's great. She loves the coLord and it is much faster than her old one. Movies looked good
"The fire is impressive. It is fast and runs applications effectively. However, storage capacity claims are misleading. I bought the 16 gb version, and found that this translated to only about 3 gb of usable space. I certainly understand that some storage is needed for the operating system, but 13 gb is excessive, especially since Amazon sells an 8 gb model. Perhaps I am an unusual case. However, I had previously bought an 8 gb model that was almost unusable as the storage capacity was so low."
Love Love the Kindles! We have purchased 5 Kindles so far and been happy with every one of them.
Wonderful
I use it for basic game apps and reading books.
"Can't complain much for the money, but you're on your own figuring our how to use it! You may be able to get help via email or phone call, but the Kindle's built-in Help is pretty much non-existent, and website help is also pretty much useless. For a company with such a good customer srrvice reputation, I find the near-complete lack of information and help shocking."
Very disappointed. It took to long to get itand I was sorry when I did. All I get is join this and join that all for a fee after 30 days. It does not do alot and the games are'nt that good.. I wish I went with the Apple Ipad
Exactly what I was looking for - easy to use and lots of free kid friendly apps !
Delivered much quicker than anticipated. Love front and back cameras but my kindle fire 8inch takes better quality photos.
"Got this as a gift for my girls, and it works great. Good thing I got two."
Love it ... Very easy to do ... And very light.
great tablet
A gift & they love it.
Really liked the larger screen from the 6''.
Met all my expectations and then some.
Wish the battery life was longer.  I don't know if I charged it fully the first time but I thought it would last longer than it does.  Any ideas about what I should do.
"Great tablet for my wife, who just wants to use one. Not technically oriented. Would not use the iPad that I love. But she uses this one."
Great Tab for the money we have 3 of them
"I just learning to use it,seems to be easy ,but for me no to much info in writing hate to do everything digital."
"Meets my all expectations as advertised, my only wish is that I could read it outside without an anti-glare after product.  My 1st Kindle was the best for no glare although no color.  Bring it back with all the current upgrades even without color and I'll would buy it.  Everyone I talk to loved the 1st edition for that feature."
"We originally bought a first generation Kindle Fire and this new one works very well and has a very nice display, very fast compared to the old Kindle Fire."
What a great tablet. I am 100% satisfied.
Love this Fire HD 7. Great for games and e-books. Enjoy this purchase!
Easy to setup. Delivers what it promises.
"This is my third kindle, obviously this my preferred brand of tablets, I have tried other brands. My first one is still in use. I just got this about a week ago so cannot comment on longevity but am pleased with how little effort is required to get set up. I am happy with camera on both front & back, the improved sound & volume, faster loading & sign on. My single criticism at this point is the flat power button, which is awkward to use. Keep up the good work"
Battery life is terrible. To small for my taste.
The family is loving this tablet!
"Do not like it as well as my old one.  The screen is cracked on my old fire HD.  The size is an issue on new one, making it difficult to hold.  The old one seems to be more user friendly"
"We like it, looks good and sounds great."
Total waste.  If all you want is to use Amazon this would be great.  But trying to use it like an actual pad is a waste of time.  It's now really hard to install 3rd party apps that worked on previous Fires.  So the old one still gets used more than the new one I bought to replace it.
Loved it
Nice clear picture.  Light weight and slim.
Nice tablet for the money.  A little slow.  My kids will probably get a lot more enjoyment out of this than me.
Just what I expected. Great!!! Love it can't wait to use the camera
Lasted less than 6 months and now it won't turn on! Very disappointed!
did not realize this had ads...asked the person in the store to sell an ad-free model....clearly they blew it
Love love love it !
"Good quality as expected from amazon products. Heavier than I expected, excellent screen quality and good to OK sound quality. Can't beat the price."
I've had several high end tablets but could never get into the tablet groove.  I got this one for reading books and use it all of the time.  I always have it with me and use it for a lot of things in addition to reading.
I LOVE my Kindle Fire HD 7!
Simply awesome
Nice product. As described.
I love it!
"Battery life is great, screen is great, reading on it is really nice. Touch is responsive and everything runs well. I use it to play Hearthstone a lot, which is a demanding game for this device but it works really well. Easy to use. There are definitely nicer tablets out there but for the price you really can't beat this one. Would definitely recommend."
"I wanted something which worked with Amazon Local Register (though, due to other headaches with that product, this was a poor reason to get it).  The tablet was inexpensive and shipped Prime, so I'm still happy with my purchase. Good screen, but GREAT sound. Bluetooth and WiFi work OK. In retrospect, I wouldn't mind NFC, but whatever. I'm happy with battery life/weight tradeoff. The camera isn't great, but is acceptable.<br /><br />The Fire OS is not as good as an Android OS closer to stock. The amazon app store is not as good as the Google Play app store. I knew both those going in. They mostly work for me, though & I'm a power user. Free google play store apps can be installed without rooting. Some of the older google apps can be installed as well.  I'm running gmail and it works, though I get a warning about google play services. The silk browser is still pretty bad, but Ghostery was easy to install. I wish I had a way of installing Prestissimo or similar to play podcasts back at a faster rate. I haven't tried rooting it, so some of that may be possible with a bit more work.<br /><br />The small memory size is slightly annoying, but is just about the lower limit for what a power user needs.<br /><br />I appreciate the &#34;family&#34; mode that allows multiple amazon accts to use the tablet. But the small amount of storage space becomes more apparent when you have large apps or large data that the multiple accts can't share.  I also don't like the 2 adult/3 child limit. My business acct and my personal acct tied up the two adult accts & I couldn't add my significant other.<br /><br />The ads were more annoying than I thought they'd be; I ended up paying to disable them.<br /><br />Still, I'm pretty happy.  Would I be &#34;happier&#34; if someone just handed me a namebrand tablet that had a more Google experience? Definitely. But is that worth paying the price differential for? Definitely not. There may be some no-name tablets or used tablets that would compete at this price level, but the Fire HD 7 offers a reasonable value.this price level, but the Fire HD 7 offers a reasonable value."
This is an excellent product~
Love it
Love my tablet!😂 Camera is awesome!!
Like very much
"I have owned several Kindles over the last 3 years.  I've tried nearly every model and size of Fire that has been produced.  Each one is better than the last.  This, by far, is one of the best KindleFire tablets I have ever seen.  The HD7 allows for great viewing and is nice for streaming movies.  I don't use the e-reader much, but it is great.  The font size can easily be changed for large print readers.<br /><br />Overall, I like the KindleFire, and this is the best one yet."
I love it
Have had  previous kindles which I have loved. This even exceeds the A!
Great -easy to use.
"I have adored my first generation Kindle for 3 years until recently, I thought it is due for an upgrade and that my old trusted kindle is bound to grace somebody else's affection for reading. I was excited getting this new kindle, so many raving reviews and all. The Firefly technology with it is a neat app, recognizing music and pictures you point it to (I have played with it and it was really amazing). The screen is crisper, brighter, clearer. The sound is louder and more distinct. The body is slimmer and smooth to the touch. The fonts, more defined. It's faster and slicker, easy-access and user-friendly. I've only had it for a few weeks and  really like all the upgrades they did. The kindle unlimited is great, too except I think it is quite expensive. It has a new feature of audio reader which is smart but still, expensive for 10$ a month when there are sites that will notify you should your books get a discount or are free. Nonetheless, overall, it is a great tablet. =)"
Great item
"It is great, but it can be slow sometimes"
Easy start up...love it!
LOVE IT!!!!
fun to use while hanging out at internet coffee houses
I really like it!  It is just the perfect size and easy to use.
Over all great device. The only real complaint I have is it has problems with listening to music and playing a game at the same time. There are a few other minor glitches but it's really not that bad. Fix them and the music situation and this is a 5 star device. In the end I would recommend this to anyone.
"I bought this for my husband as he reads his daily bible with it.  He had another brand, but loves this one.  Problem is, he won't let me down<br />load and use it, to protective.  Thanks for a great item"
Its a great. I love it
"As expected, this Kindle meets all of our needs to download books and access the internet. For the price, this Kindle is a great for traveling and for home use."
Everything I expected. Its a good device.
"Great for stashing books away, just a couple things the power button is almost to flush with the housing and the battery seems to die faster but neither one of those are that big of a deal, great product."
"This was my second (and last) Kindle.  The first was a gift and while I bristled at the idea of an e-reader (I much prefer the feel of an actual book in my hands),  I found other uses for it (Games.  I admit it),  so when, after a year and half, the tablet stopped charging, I decided to replace it.  The newer Kindle began having connection issues after a month...  a factory reset seemed to resolve that problem....  and charging issues after two.  Now, the unit is less than  four months old  and will not charge at all.  You, of course, may have better luck with yours, but I'm saving my pennies and buying a Nook."
Very pleased.  User friendly.  Like its size and speed.
My fire HD7  stop working to day  can some one help me.
Better then expected. Easy to use and fast. Picture is great.
"Was a gift for mothers day from my children.  Still getting use to it but enjoying playing games, Facebook,  and also made a few purchases on Amazon."
"I was very disappointed in the storage capacity. With 8 GB of storage I expected to be able to store tons of music and several videos.  I had the old version of Fire HD and I was able to download at least six or seven videos and most of my music with no problem but this new one hardly holds any music and maybe one video, if it's not large before I've reached full capacity.  This was NOT what I was expecting."
"Not happy and have returned it.  Guess I'm in the wrong generation for<br />this kind of thing, I found it very complex.  Also, the glare was awful."
Love it!
I like my Fire HD.  The only thing you can't put background on it.  I think everybody would like to<br />customize their Fire HD.  I don't see what the problem with Amazon about letting people do it.
thank you  its awesome
Kindle Fire HD 7 is much better than previous Fire HD.  The charger cord is too short so you have to leave Kindle on floor while charging or buy another charger with longer cord.
Would have have it a five but when I download games the pictures don't show up just little squares so the kids can't figure out what game is which
"Love it so far. Looks great, easy to use. Only thing is battery doesn't seem to last as long as I'd expect"
"Reading it up.  Once learned the changes in operation from my original Kindle, it was great."
I would give it 5 stars but the volume sometimes works and sometimes don't.
"Works well enough.  In terms of applications and ease of use, it's a little clunky compared to other tablets.  It definitely takes some getting used to as it's not formatted like other tablets or phones.  Being used to Apple and Samsung products and functionalities, this was definitely not as easy to get started on.  I felt like certain functionalities are not intuitive, for instance, it took me a little while to get used to where the web application was as it sometimes is hidden.  These days, icons are more popular than text links, and I feel like the lack of enough visual icon cues could be something that Amazon works on.  However, I will say that for the price, it's pretty damn sweet.  I got it on sale and if it works, I can't complain."
"My husband bought e a kindle fire when it first came out.  I loved it.  I noticed a problem with the charger ports when my Mom's quit charging , then my son's and my daughter in laws stopped charging.  I had trouble for quite some time but I could usually jiggle it and get it to charge.  It DoD finally stopped charging.  My kindle hire h d was a gift from my husband to replace the first one.  It has a lot of new feature that I'm learning about.  As long as it keeps charging I will be happy."
I use this pad instead of our home computer on most occasions. My wife and I both have one and cant put them down.
I am very happy with my purchase. Love it!! Just what I wanted!
Love my Kindle Fire. Great for reading and easy to navigate. Love that I can set it up for my kids to use without worrying!
She loved it.
"I've had 3 Fire 7 tablets, and this latest one is the best by far.  The sound is greatly improved, and I love the IMDB stats/info available while I watch Amazon Prime movies.  I wish that were available on all of the movies, but it's fun on those that do have it.  Of note, the speed on this latest tablet is noticeably better.  I got the 16GB version because I love to have loaded audible books, movies, music, and games readily available.  I don't need any more storage than that because the Amazon cloud is user friendly.  Also of note, the Fire tablets hold resale value.  My 2013 Fire Tablet was worth $79 on eBay.  So stepping up to this latest Fire tablet cost less than $50 - I took advantage of a great sale Amazon had.<br /><br />My experience with tablets - I have an iPad 2 (old, slow, but still going great), an iPad Mini 2, and a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro. I use them all, trading off for their individual assets.  This latest Amazon Fire 7, I'm happy to say, is not a &#34;distant cousin&#34; to any of them"
"So far so good.  I am still getting familiarized with settings and functions, but I can definitely already see it will be beneficial for me and my son when we travel and WiFi is not readily available."
"the most i can say is if they left it as a nice tablet in which you had decent control over and it supported google services it would be the best eh tablet for you money unless you need power user level things but since you have very little control it's not great almost not good i like google chrome and  have book marks, since this kindle does not support google servies i can not veiw those book marks nor can i get on youtube,use chromecast,gmail things that matter and buy now are basic on almost all tablets i don't mind the amazon crap that make it hard to use and make the system seem like it's for kids but i could get over it more if i could just use the things i want i don't need google play to get apps taht's fione but let me get the things i want.this device is a 50/50 for me spec wise it's very nice it can't play some games well(hearthstone) but no biggie but software wise it's a 2 star nothing is good about and they don't let you make it better atleast for now"
The fact that you cannot personalize the Kindle and are bombarded with constant ads is very bothersome and to think that to stop the ads on locks creen you have to pay a one time fee is degrading.  Save your money for a more customer friendly device. BELIEVE ME IT LACK A LOT OF THINK IT IS VERY LIMITED
I had to change my review.  I have lots of trouble from the product.  I had so much trouble that I called and they replaced (with a refurb) and now it has died.  Will contact Amazon again to see what they will do.  Has been more trouble than it is worth.  Wish that I would have went with a more inexpensive version.
"very nice device, and getting easier to use."
"Love my new Fire!  Really, Really need a case.  Where CAN I GET ONE?"
Nice and handy for a perfect tablet.
it would if it came with instructions.
Love it!
great product
I am having problems transferring my iTunes and pictures from my old  divice. Color is very nice on the fire HD 7 and it takes beautiful photos.
Loving it
"I have never owned a kindle before and am really impressed with this Kindle Fire HD.  I got the 7&#34; screen and it is a really nice size screen. I also like being able to customize the casing. I did order a case for it to be able to use it standing up. I was able to set up the Kindle easily and since it to my amazon accounts as well as emails. Additionally, the Kindle can join any network and have internet access so you can use it as a tablet and have access to websites, apps, and things like Facebook. Browsing books on the Kindle is a breeze too, I just log into my amazon kindle account and find the touch screen works great. I have already been using the kindle daily."
"I do really like it, now I wish I would have got a bigger one"
As soon as i learn to navigate everything I will more than likely love it.
"yes, It was a Mothers day present from my son and I love everything about it including the color !!!"
best gift ever
"I own the original kindle , which I love. I was accumulating too many books. However I love that I can do pretty much anything I Candis withy lap top, a camera .wow"
"I'm kind of annoyed with it, the color is nice.  But I'm really disappointed with Amazon on this one as I thought I would be able to also get my magazines subscriptions on this, but it is a huge pain in the ass with you can't get Google Play.  It's a problem with the competition is that no one wants you using certain platforms.  I ran into this with Amazon and my Samsung TV with Prime Instant, when you buy things with convenience in mind it can be a real problem.  So now I just basically use this for reading books, so it is just ok for me."
Love it!
Ok just didn't realize that a new book would not open without WiFi connection
Sure was a treat reading &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; on the Kindle vs. the paperback which is 985 pages.
SO FAR SO GOOD WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SD CARD SLOT.
I love love this kindle. First one I owned. I can not believe it took me this long to write a review.
Only thing is I can't read it in the sun.  Didn't think about that when I ordered it - but I love it at night when my husband is sleeping and I'm reading in bed.
I bought this for my mother for her birthday and she really likes it and uses it everyday!
"I received this as an anniversary gift from my wonderful husband.  My old kindle is an original kindle fire, and I love it.  After more than 3 years it still works great.  My new HD7 has a much better picture, so much more defined and clear! It's really responsive to touch and easy to use.  I had absolutely no trouble with the set up, getting it registered to my account was a breeze.  I love the sound on it, so much more clear and loud than I expected.  I love the front and rear facing cameras too.  So far I haven't found anything about it that I don't love.  I wish that I could personalize the lock screen.  That's my only disappointment but I knew about it from my experience with my 1st gen fire.  I am happy with my upgrade!"
"Love it, exactly what I expected. Works fast and picture quality is pretty good."
"I bought this for my granddaughter.  Her laptop gave out after a couple of years constant use.  Because she didn't use all of the features on the laptop I figured a tablet might be the better purchase this time around.  My daughter helped to pick it out.  She had an older version with a larger screen, but this one seems just right for our pre-teen.  She's had it a week and I have to go check on her to make sure she's still with us as I haven't seen her since she immersed herself in it.  I'm sure that will pass, but for right now Grandma couldn't have made her  happier."
One little drop and the screen shattered....
I love this kindle fire hd 7.  The only problem I'm finding is I can't seem to figure out how to transfer my books off my 7th generation kindle to the fire.
"The only reason I can't give this tablet 5 stars is that it doesn't have a back button to help me escape places I don't want to be.  There is a back arrow but it doesn't always take you back to the last screen you were on.  This is especially true when you click on a video while you are in Facebook.  The back arrow takes you back to the last video you watched instead of back to Facebook.  Also, it doesn't always show me &#34;new stories&#34; so I can see the new posts on Facebook easily.  It is a nice tablet and the easiest to download books into.  That's the main reason I love it."
great device that works excellent for what I need.
"If you're looking for a user-friendly tablet, this isn't one. It's very Amazon focused. This is for people who need a glorified e-reader."
good one
Can.t say enough....really a great product.
"SO FAR SO GOOD. EXCEPT FOR ONE THING, SOME MAY FIND TO BE VERY MINOR, BUT TO ME VERY ANNOYING AND IRRITATING. CONSIDERING THIS IS THE NEWEST &#34;IT&#34; THING. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTOMATIC SCREEN BRIGHTNESS OPTION!"
Got stolen a month after purchase and warranty doesn't cover the replacement.  Rip off
My wife loves it
Excellent tablet and a really low price! Great for Kindle reading as well as browsing the web and downloading apps. Crystal clear screen and fast response time.  The performance and price beats the competition. : )
I only gave it 4 stars because I was disappointed that I couldn't save pictures from Facebook.  I love saving random pictures of my family from FB and I can't do that with this Kindle Fire HD 7.  I wish they would fix this and send out an update.  Other than that I like this Kindle just fine.
Now I can watch Netflix on TV. Great tablet and great reader too!
I really love my new kindle fire! Resolution is great and features are easy to use.!
Really cute tablet- but totally not like the commercials at all! In one of the commercials for this tablet the lady leaves it on top of her van and it falls off onto the concrete. My 4 year old dropped this from about a foot from the ground in the store and shattered the screen. Luckily I purchased a warranty with it to get it replaced.
"Got this on the special they ran in April as a gift for my husband. He LOVES IT. Easy to set up, nice size for streaming but still small enough that it is easily held in hand. Can't wait to buy another one."
"I found the tablet to be easy to setup, and enjoyable to have and use. Love it!!! Highly recommended"
Love it!
"Love the size, features, and how easily it is to use."
"I initially wanted a Kindle Paper-white but I went with this little beauty instead because it can do so much more.  I love everything about it exception of the  weight.  It is a little heavy after holding it for a while, but I can stand it up with the cover I purchased with it and it's fine."
The thing that I was so excited about was the camera!! But no its not that good ... But other wise I like it
"My new Kindle is hard to turn on, there is nothing to indicate if the battery has finished charging.  I cannot tell the difference between my old Kindle or the new one."
"The Fire HD arrived prior to the original due date and in good condition.  The display is very clean and clear.  However, a ridiculous amount of Amazon ads pop up on various screens.  And some of the apps work fine for a while and then randomly go back a screen.  This ocurs numerous times in a row which is very frustrating.  Many times I have to exit and restart either the app (which sometimes still does not fix it) or turn off the Kindle."
Have finally got my wireless going.I am enjoying my Kindle.
My little Grandaughter loves it. She always wanted my iPad so that's why I got this one.
I Love my kindle fire!
Love this.  It's my 2nd Kindle Fire and I love having the extra storage. Lots of interesting features including being able to turn on the TV in the basement when I am on the 2nd floor.  (TV is connected to Kindle Fire Stick.)
very happy with it...does just what I needed it to do.  I'm a happy camper!
This was a gift for my husband; he and my grandson are enjoying it!
"I loved my first Fire and ordered a second, updated version. #1 improvement: the camera! The only negative I have is that the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge as well or as long as the preceding model."
It's awesome. I love it. Best purchase yet
Great little tablet
son loves it
great piece
Transition was as smooth as ice cream.  I am actually getting skilled at this thanks for keeping it at the 3rd grade level at 70 I appreciate that
"Bought this for my seven year old, she loves the games. I love that there are many free books that she can read as well as the ones you pay for."
Works wonderful for me.  I love it.  The bigger screen in also a plus.
It does exactly as I expected and will be the backup for my getting shaggy Kindle 2 (having problems with the power switching after all these years.)
"The unit restarted and froze prior to and after updates installed, at this point I decided the fire wasn't for me.  I went online to request a refund with amazon, I was given 1/4 of the value of the kindle.  I then chatted and spoke to someone who said they'd issue a full refund.  I am still waiting for a full refund from amazon and my tracking says i am not entitled to a full refund, only partial.  BEWARE! IF YOU PURCHASE THIS...AND EXPERIENCE ISSUES, YOU WILL HAVE DRAMA AND MAY NOT GET A FULL REFUND!"
"This is perfect for what I want to use it for.  Small enough to be convenient, big enough for video viewing."
Does just what it is suppose to do very happy
This is a great tablet for kids and the price was exceptional.
DON'T KNOW HOW I LIVED WITH OUT IT
"Pros:  awesome tool to read, feels like a book because its heavy.  Awesome for Audible listening.<br /><br />Cons:  Very limited quality apps.  Web browser not fully functional on some sites.  Black background is not customizable."
wife love it use it all the time now
"I enjoy having some color on my screen.  I am still learning my way around, but I'm sure it will get easier the more time I spend with it."
Loved it.
Good item
The color is vibrant!  It is just the right size to fit in my purse.  I love the lightweight feel!
Great
I do like it. Takes some getting used to not seeing all apps on screen and all the ads that pop up on the carousel
"This was purchased for us, me & my husband as a gift.  It is very nice.  We are learning how to get to what we want."
My daughter loves her kindle fire.
"Wow this new Kindle is better than I expected!!  I use it now more than my Laptop OR my desk PC. It is NOT just a Kindle Book Reader BUT A FULL FLEDGED TABLET PC and BOOK READER.,,, GOOD JOB ON THIS NEW MODEL. ps I STILL USE MY ORIGINAL KINDLE FOR JUST READING BOOKS!!<br /><br />GEORGE"
Love it!
"My new Kindle Fire has surpassed my expectations. It is fast and easy to use, only had it a few days and am already very comfortable with it."
This is my second tablet.  My first tablet lasted one month then quit functioning but so far the Fire HD has met all my expectations and l am very pleased with it.
"Love the Kindle.  This is our second kindle, my daughter has the original black and white version to read books.  My wife has an I-pad but seems to use this kindle a lot as it is easier for her to hold.<br /><br />The battery life seems very adequate.  I do let the battery run all the way down to the &#34;red&#34; before charging as I want the battery to last.  I don't know if it has memory or not.<br /><br />I only wish some of the apps I read about such as Morningstar, Craigslist Pro were available on this kindle.  I was under the impression that since this is an android, the apps would be available but found I was mistaken.<br /><br />I seem to use this kindle more for web search, email then I do on my desktop computer.<br />I purchased the USB adapter thinking I could load an Excel program but again found this is not possible.  I think the USB adapter is for uploading pictures."
"I'm still learning the device, but so far... I like my Samsung Galaxy Tab far better. The fire doesn’t have the same apps that I use. They're similar but not better and can't be used independent of internet connection."
Nice and compact.  Can take it anywhere.
"I love my fire.  I use it for emails and Facebook, maps, looking up information.  Still getting use to what I need and want on this little tablet.  Tks"
This is my first FIRE and it would have been helpful if more instructions had been included.
Extremely happy with it
This tablet exceeded my expectations.  The picture is amazing.
It is better than the Kindle Fire purchased 2 years ago and it cost $100 less.
"Perfect. I love my Kindle. Wish I could print from it, but aside from that it couldn't be any better."
"I really like the Fire HD7 a lot. I am thrilled with being able to take and share photos. Much of the rest is like a former Kindle. I am extremely pleased with my Fire, and the one day special offer made it very affordable."
Good Tablet for the price.<br />Downside is the Apps from Amazon forcing more difficult issues for std. google and android apps.
Can't get all the games and things on this updated one that  I had on my old one.
Great product made better by Amazon Prime. Received quickly after it was in stock. Epic convenience both in shopping for and use of Kindle Fire
doesn't support google products. took it back
Excellent buy
"went up a larger size from 6 to 7.7 amazon like always return no problem  came in 3 days.Now to the point we both had original kindels,and everything in our house is apple(mac,laptop air,2 i-pads,2 i-phone 2 i pods)but even though we love apple we really love our new fire.Take it from and apple lover kindle fire rocks.Buy 1 or 2 you love everything about it"
It's great. Love it.
"Liked old one , this one not easy to use , downloading is a problem."
I love it.  Still learning how to use it as different from my first edition kindle.
"I gave it to my wife for a extra pad for her, she likes how fast it isn't!"
It's great. Love my new fire
Love my kindle! Haven't done anything more than read my books and get on social media but everything loads so quickly! I'm taking my time trying to figure the other things out; I don't know what most of them are but my granddaughter is giving me lessons.
Love it!
"Sound and picture quality are very good.  8 hour usage from battery is not what I have experienced, usually 4-5 hours max.  Unable to print user guide pages which would be quite helpful rather than continually referring back to guide on more detailed and complicated instructions.  The price ,of course, is exceptionally good."
Sometimes the screen freezes
Amazing product.
"we buy Kindles for our non profit for the cancer/physically challenged kids. www.readsanddeeds.org  They are a manageable size while they are in the hospital and at home. Very durable, quality excellent, picture quality excellent. I am a fan of Amazon Kindles for the price and size. Allows us to reach so many more kids for 1/3 of the price."
"Awesome, I love it. going to buy another soon. Only problem is some Android apps will not work. Dolby sound is clear and good and screen resolution is very cleer even wnen conected to 60 &#34; hd tv to watch movies."
"Love it. Perfect size and weight, I use it all day long."
Not that different from the original and memory always seems to be a problem.
"I am very pleased with my fire HD 7&#34;. I read a lot, just the right weight.. Fits well in my handbag. Enjoy keeping in touch with everyone on face book.<br />Easy to use, I am eighty five years old, I am enjoying it very much."
"I bought this device for one of my grand sons, who absolutely loves it and so do I.  We both use it!"
Love it! Have no complaints.
My husband loves this kindle. He gets frusrated with computers but this kindle allows him to easily negotiate the net and easily get books from the library etc. He uses it daily - with a smile!
"A GREAT TABLET, I REALLY LOVE IT. ALL IN<br />ONE DEVICE, MUSIC, MOVIES, GAMES. IT'S<br />VERY STRONG TOO."
Great product!!!!!!
i love my new kindle. i have keep my 1st gen as a backup for those times when i forget to charge my HD. this product from Amazon is great.
Great for my needs. Didn't take much to get up to speed.  Fast graphic design awesome
Tablet has given me no problems.  Easy to use even for people like me who come from the pre computer generation.  Just the right size and weight to keep me entertained while walking the track.
talk about a product that serves no purpose.<br />i rather buy another device that i can do more with for the same price.
WAS FOR MY HUSBAND. HAD A HARD TIME GETTIMG STARTED. DON'T KNOW WHAT Special Offers WERE INCLUDED.
Love my new kindle fire hd7..still a little confused but love it but I also loved my old kindle fire. Not crazy about the case I really liked my old case for my old kindle. The new ones stand up like a picture frame and do not like it.
Pretty nice.  Battery life is horrible.
I love my kindle! It meets my expectations.
Absolutely love my Kindle fire 7 hd
I LOVE all of our Kindles!!!
I like it but need a book to determine how to use  it.  Please send me one ifit exists.
Love this tablet. Simple to use.
Nice tablet
"I love my Kindle Fire HD, the only problem is that the battery runs down really fast, I read a lot."
"1 star because the Kindle Fire has an intrinsic problem of not staying on.  I've gone through 2 Kindles with the longest one lasting 1.5 years.  Customer service did not help but offered to sell me another, soon to be broken, Kindle for the low low price of $138 a whopping $1 off."
"I love it, especially the graphic and the games."
"My kindle is one of my prized possessions (original) so I didn't think I needed a new improved one, mine was working fine. My dad wanted to buy me one, said I would love it. He was right. You can do so much more and my favorite part is the lit background. I was also able to transfer my books over from my older kindle."
Love it.  Great picture and easy to load.
Easy to use!
My son love it
Very nice.  Beats my old kindle that I dropped.
"I received this in citron and thus far, I am pleased with the ease of use, performance and the beautiful reception the device offers."
"Love it. Very easy to use. Love that it's connected with my Amazon account so that I can access music, movies, and my shopping cart on one device. Love how fast this device is."
Perfect size to carry everywhere and it does everything I needed it to do for my 3.5 year old.
Excellent little tablet. Light weight  easy to navigate
It's great
Love it
Was surprised to find it so easy to use.
Mother's day gift from my daughter.  Love it!!
Beautiful color.  Easy to navigate.  Loving my new Kindle Fire.
"Starts quickly, easy to read in dim light and connects to Web easily"
"Completely enjoy, having my e-mail, books and media in one easy to use device. It has synced nicely with my phone also. I especially enjoyed the crystal clear color display. I even prefer reading my books on the Fire to my older Kindle, screen brightness control helps improve the page. Camera is easy to use, also, and it takes very good pictures."
It is a good tablet but I seem to be only able to buy apps from the amazon store and the amazon store is not that great. So it limits what the tablet can do to entertain me. So mostly I just watch Netflix with it.
"I love my Kindle, of course, I'm still learning what all I can do with it. I Would recommend a Kindle to a friend."
seems to be an exceptional tablet. i would recommend it for anyone.
"I have yet to view all the aspects of &#34;Fire HD7&#34;, so far I am pleased with what it can do!"
"I bought myself the 16 GB and my granddaughter really took a liking to it, so I ordered her this one. She's 10 and very well educated on this kind of stuff. This being second to daily activities of course. She had a fit when I gave it to her. She's loves it. She actually uses it for a lot of things."
I LOVE IT!  Ready to go right from the box. If you have Amazon Prime you have easy access to all the perks of your membership. Watching video's is good. Video's are very crisp and the sound is clear. I am able to do my email on it and enjoy playing games on it also.  It is easy to take with and I use mine at night to read my kindle books. My mom is even thinking of getting one instead of using her laptop. She is intimidated by technology but she was able to work it easily. That is a big thing for her.  The only con I can find with it to date is it is a little heavier than the expensive ones.
Everything met expectations and then some.
It's ok definitely not something to write home about. I also have a galaxy tablet that I feel is much better and easier to use
It was a bad buy. Don't get it. It not H D at all I going to get a Samsung
This is a second one our family owns.  We all liked the first one very much so decided to get another one so two of us can use at the same time.  The few improvements over the old one are well thought out and good.  We use them about 65% of the time to read books.  I also travel with one and find it very convenient for light duty e.mail and Internet.  I have even used it to watch soccer games via the Internet. The battery life is excellent. Well worth the investment.
Just how it looks!
Awesome awesome awesome. Had a fire but not Fire HD.  Really neat.
Works as advertised
This is my second Kindle<br />  Love it
It work very good !!
Very versatile and user friendly.
Enjoying my new Kindle Fire.  Like the larger screen.
"I love it. It takes a little to get used to. I was using an older model that was just for reading, so I was used to turning it on and going right to the page I was on. Now it takes a few swipes and I'm on the page I was reading."
great
Perfection. Can't believe what I paid for it!
"Couldn't use it, couldn't connect it to my LG Bluetooth headset. Hard to go back into a book once read."
"New to tablets, this is my first!  Have loved, loved my Kindle.  Sill training on the Fire!  Not certain I'm confident enough to review.<br />Do LOVE the great HD display!  Like the light weight, wish I had bigger screen.  Not a fault of the device, rather the choice."
Very easy to use and has lots of fun features! I love it!
We were looking to get the 6 inch but this 7 inch cane on sale for the same price. We were so happy! It also came in the mail earlier than expected. Very happy.
My kindle does everything I need it to. I am very happy with it! Why spend hundreds of dollars on an IPad? You're just paying for the Apple logo ladies and gentleman.
well done...small but effective and useful
The Fire HD 7 is everything I expected and more.
Bought as a gift for my technologically challenged mother. She loves it! It i easy to maneuver an she enjoys reading on it. And now I want one for myself.
"So far I am loving it, it is easy to handle, navigate and read"
"This is my second player, so that should count to my satisfaction; I use this one primarily for audible.com and MP3s uploaded. It is perfect for listening to the books I enjoy, either while driving, or with its own speaker while lying around the house. I do plug it into my truck stereo when driving, as it puts everything in surround sound. My recent purchase was my fourth one, having given one and two as gifts, still using three, and now number four. I should hope that speaks for itself!"
"I received this on Saturday and finally got it opened on Sunday. My main purpose was to to get this for my sister so she could download games on it.  She loved it until today, Tuesday.  Just received a frantic call from her and she cannot the kindle to power up.  Any suggestions?"
I have spent 2 whole days trying to load Words With Friends Classic and cannot get my password changed.  Very frustrating as this was one of the reasons I wanted the Kindle Fire.
Wonderful.  Do not need to bring my lap top on vacation.  Just my kindle.
Got a Kindle Fire two years ago.  Never able to send emails.  This one is great.
"I can say so much about my kindle BUT I'll keep it short and just say BUY IT!!! You won't regret it, I use mine everyday and it goes everywhere with me..."
"It will not connect to the internet.  The wifi connection says 'connected' but when I try to read emails or shop amazon it says its not connected.  It was also difficult to find anything on start-up, since there were no instructions.<br /><br />Hopefully this will get better with time."
The tablet is light weight and serves many functions well.  The display is clear and it is easy to use.
Absolutely love it!  Have no issues at all.
"I almost completely love it! The things I don't love are pretty minor. I wish it took a micro scott card.for extra storage. And I wish I could personalize it: by setting a background image and by using images of my choice for the lock screen. Otherwise very pleased. An addendum:  I paid the extra $$ so as not to get ads on the lock screen.  Don't waste your money. Maybe it is diff with ads, but you only see that screen for as long ad it takes to type in a 4 digit pin."
"A week after we bought it, it lost WiFi connection and wouldn't reconnect.  After calling every service line there was to call, we were finally connected to an amazon tech. support jacka$% who told us that he could fix it but we would be charged for the service. (It has a &#34;one year&#34; warranty!!)"
My son loves his gift!
Met my expectations
"Retuned, i have become attatched to Google Play store, not an option on this device. It was a quality pad, lots of GB space, but no play store makes this a deal breaker for me. Device returned."
Loved it just like i loved the last two!
a bit quirky but a great value. Have refrained from calling support - instead a trying to solve issues myself. great sound & screen resolution. netfilx movies video & sound are great. Transfers from my Win 7 laptop to fire 7 are easy. Is there a built in file manager? have had 4 a month & discover more each day. the wifi is good at the gym - like on the cardio equip - watching video is much better than on my comparatively small android phone. Have bought maybe 1 dozen - apps for Android phone - would like know if I have to buy them again to use on the FIRE 7.
Very short battery life.  Hard to toggle back and forth.
"I don't know what special offers they were going to give with the purchase of this, but I never got anything extra"
Very good value.  Wish it has as many apps as Android's shop.
"Had and older model.  No camera. I gave to 3 year old for her learning games, and love my new one....."
Perfect for my vacation at the beach
"Slower then expected. Not happy with the way it slowly navigates through Facebook, google, etc. Have the time the apps don't even work correctly."
Love it.
The Fire HD is fantastic for what it is designed for.  Love it
Nice as a mini computer. Take along works well.
"I am still learning all the features, and have not downloaded a book just yet.  I wanted something very portable other than a laptop and could not afford an IPad - this tablet suits my needs for work and home."
"Entertainment, the Web, email, music, whatever your needs are, this is the right tablet. And it is quiet affordable. Great buy."
Overall I like this device quite a lot but prefer my original rather plain Kindle reader for reading books. It's fun with the other features like going online.
excellent tool. gave it a four because I am still learning the ropes on it
Simply amazing!  Fast response and the size works for me.
"As a recent iPad user frustrated with degradation of performance after iOS upgrade, I am finding the Fire a great alternative to the iPad."
"Awesome, works great."
This is my second kindle fire and it is everything I was hoping for.  It will be nice to now be able to take pictures with it and store them as well.
Love it.  Much faster than the old fire.
"To date, it's been everythign I needed it to be - an e-reader, an occasional web browser, a tablet-game player.  I had thought to replace my old Kindle Touch with it completely, but I don't think I will do that.  It requires a lot more power to use, so the battery life on the Touch is definitely much better.<br /><br />One quibble I do have with this device is there is no easy way to close the app you're in.  I've left my app, by going to the home screen, and come back in, to find I'm at exactly the same spot I was when I left.  That is frustrating/annoying when it comes to games."
"Work great, nice size and good price! I love it!!"
"I was very disappointed. The discription was misleading. I thought I was getting 8 GB of usable storage,but I only got 4. The other 4 is taken up with system files and factory downloads I may or may not have wanted. Returning to upgrade to 16 GB."
"It's very nice, but it does not run a lot of google apps"
love it
I am loving my new Fire!!!!!
I love it!
Love it.
I love my new Kindle and the price was perfect as I had just had an accident with a previous one.  I have chosen the Kindle over the iPad several times and will continue to do so!
It is a good value for the sale price. It does everything I need it to do.
Absolutely love my kindle fire...don't know how I survived without it as long as I did.
I love it . my grandson likes it also. haven't had a lot of time to use it a lot.  Can't wait .Great buy.
there is no light showing whether it is charging or not  You have to turn it on and wait until it loads up
Great device!!!!!
I really like it.  It holds a charge for a very long time. The quality of the viewing is great.
I love it!!!!!
This is my 2nd one.  I loved my first one and this one does even more.  It's  great!
The Fire HD 7 doesn't hold a charge for long.  There are several situations in which the proper action is not intuitive.  The camera is worthless in low light situations.  I wish it had onboard photo storage.  But my wife loves it!
user friendly and very easy to navigate.
awesome
Love it!
A Lot more than what I expected at that price.
My first Fire HD was stolen so I deactivated and ordered another.  This one seems to work better than the other and the chargeing port and speaker ports are positioned better and in addition it has a rear camera which is a big plus.  The on off switch is nicely located which activates it immediately when it is in sleep mode.  I use it as a bedside radio at night and once in awhile during the day.  I am a senior citizen.
"This is my 3rd Kindle and I LOVE IT!!! Light, easy to use and set up especially for those who are technologically challenged which I am not. Great visuals as well. You will love it! I especially like the white border."
Works great!  I would definitely recommend.
"Not nearly as intuitive or useful as an iPad.  It was cheap, probably its only real plus."
"should have ordered 16 GB, 8GB is not enough and price of 16 GB is a rip off. Should have given an expansion slot."
Great for young kids for games!
"Nice and small, I love reading on it. Very easy to handle"
SO FAR I LUV IT.
I LOVE MY KINDLE. This is my 2nd one.
"I'm thinking about returning this Fire HD 7. For starters, it can only use the Silk browser, unless you want to hack it. If I were 12 again, I might be into hacking it, but I don't have time for that. There are several other browsers available for Android devices - I'm not sure why this limitation exists.<br /><br />Second, when reading a PDF version of a book the words are about 4 pt type. They are crystal clear. The definition is amazing. I guess the response from the Amazon folks is - you should buy all your books in Kindle versions. My response is - ok, then I'll try a different device that works for me. You keep selling devices that make it hard to read other people's products, and telling me I need to buy yours - good luck with that. In the meantime, I'll look around for a better product."
"Love it! It does so much more than I even expected or was aware of when I first got it. Movies, books, games, apps;  I can even use it at work to write observations. Since I bought one for myself, I've also purchased three as gifts. I would highly recommend it."
I love my new fire hd7.  I love everything about it. It is so superior to the Dell venue 7. So glad I bought it!
"This was purchased as a replacement for an earlier Kindle version.  It meets my expectations.  Easy to download books, apps, games etc and to check email. Sale price certainly made the purchase even more worthwhile. Delivery was quick and set up easy."
Wonderful
"I had no idea when I bought this one that every time I turned it on, it would bring up advertisements. It's beyond annoying. I didn't realize I was paying for ads. I'm seriously considering getting rid of this and just returning to a basic ereader."
My grandson was very happy with the kindle thank you for the fast delivery
The display is flawless the price is right and I should have gone with the largest one they had BUT there was too much of a price gap 100 to 300 basically just for a larger screen. The only other complaint is the Amazon App store. It's not as good as Google Play so you're stuck unless you find a work around without rooting the device.
I love this Fire HD 7! It is perfect for my needs.Now if I can just figure out how to get wifi where there isn't any. :)
The first one I had less than a month & it just completely stopped working. So to me that's a total piece of junk!
"The best in the business, I love this gadget, who needs to spend so much money when simplicity and quality at the same time is what you get with Kindle Fire &#34;7."
"It's an amazing device, at such a reasonable price!"
"It's brand new and I'm having problems already. The battery life sucks. It goes down pretty fast. And when it shuts off its hard for me to get it back , on. Other than that everything is perfect. How I wish I could've given five stars."
I am enjoying this Fire HD so far it is very easy to use.
"A little more confusing to use than my other kindles, but generally good"
Apps will automatically shut down. Video drops out. Really can't do much except read books.
Is thisKindle a 2012 version or newer?
It is awesome! Easy to use. Very fast. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and am very happy with it!
Bought for my grandson. He loves it and a happy grandson makes a happy grand mom.
Love it.
BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!!!! Got the kindle fire 3 months ago. Has worked great until one day it didn't. Screen went black while watching Netflix and would never come back. Had to return to get a new one.
Bought for my 7 year old son.  He hasn't got it yet but I've played with it to set it up and now I think I need to upgrade mine!
Wow! Keep up the good work!
Have trouble integrating with other readers and other publishers.
Great
Extremely high definition pictures on this tablet.....great speakers.....rugged build......all in a 7 inch package......I love it.<br />This purchase more than meets my expectations when I first purchased it.....on sale I might add for $119.00 for the 16G version direct from Amazon.<br />Now how you going to beat that ........ ?<br />D.
I am very satisfied with my kindle and everything I have downloaded on it.
"I love my Fire HD! I have been wanting this for a long time and I finally was able to get it. I love the ease of having all my amazon purchases on one device and still am able to watch netflix, read comics and play games. I just wish that I was able to get the Fire with Wifi but for now this one is making me very HAPPY."
"As advertised it should slide off a car and not break. My son dropped it not even a foot from the lament floor and the screen shattered. I was going to switch devices with my older 16 GB version (before the drop) b/c 8GB equals 2 games and Amazon free-time...nothing else. For some reason, it keeps defaulting back to airplane mode b/c of wifi or storage. It feels cheaply made and has been the biggest pain since Xmas. I realize the 8GB was my fault, but I'm very disappointed in this version of the Fire HD. It was a 114.00 mistake b/c it's worth 40.00..now nothing"
Enjoying device...a lot to learn though!
My wife really liked her Anniversary upgrade.  She had been fighting with the charger of her previous Kindel.
"Good Lord, where has this been all my life.  If you don';t need Office or Quicken, this does just about everything.  We even used it to create a scoreboard for my daughter' volleyball team during a tournament when we couldn't see the score table.  (see my review on that very cool app)"
Although our first gen Kindle's are still working fine we decided to get newer ones because of the one day special.  Needless to say the HD display is crisp and bright.  We are very Happt with our purchase.
Would be great if the battery lasted more than 40 minutes. I can't even watch 2 kids TV shows without the thing needing a charge. Useless
Great item!!!
Very nice I like all only thing I thought screen was a little bigger
"I love my Fire HD, very nice and the color is nice too."
Love it!!
It is great . Love it ...
It's awesome.
I like it!  My Granddaughter loves it. She wanted to trade her Kindel Fire (which I purchased 3 yeards ago) for mine.
"Other than it taking forever and a day for it to ship for something that was supposed to be in stock, I absolutely love it. I'm sure I'll find a million more reasons to love it as I get used to it."
It is exactly what we needed. It is always on. Someone is always in line to use it next. Much smoother and many more apps available now.
"I love the kindle fire, however I was not impressed with the tech support,"
This is a great device.
unless you want to spend a lot of money on amazon this thing is basically it advertised a of memory but I only have access to around 5 very big disappointment wish I could get my money back but I got it at a charity auction and paid almost full price should have bought a samsung tablet dead you cannot even had a memory card and you cannot customize any photos for your home screen because it just shows you suggested amazon prada so disappointed please do not waste your money on a kindle prada les you want to buy a bunch of amazon stuff
I like it a lot. The only  thing I don't like is the flash player will not work for my son's reading literacy program. Other than that; it's good!
Excellent graphics and faster processor than the original Fire.
What a great gift for my reader in the family. Lots of free books too!!!
"&#34;7&#34; is great .......so far, but jacket purchased doesn't cut it for a one handed handicap guy."
Absolutely love it!!! Looking forward to many enjoyable days with my new Fire!!!
Very happy
Worked just fine!
Love my new tablet
"Cheaply made, bad battery life, weird freezing on books and video. And the download time for books is terrible. I have the kindle fire 6 and I loved it so much that when I received the fire hd 7&#34; was sadly dissapointed."
Pretty easy to navigate. Doesn't seem as fast as say a galaxy or iPad. But bought for our son and is perfect for that aspect. Especially for the price
Great
"The Fire has a nice feel and weight to it.  The speed is better than my laptop. The screen is crisp and the colors sharp.  Wish the speakers were a little better but this is a tablet after all.  Overall, I'm very pleased with my fire."
Awesome
"So far so good, I don't like those large 8&#34; and 9&#34; screens so this 7&#34; is great for me. Much nicer HD screen graphics, like the volume buttons. Still trying other features."
Just as advertised. No issues.
"Fire HD 7, Wifi,16 GB is a great tablet.  The screen is sharp and the navigation is easy.  I appreciate the new updates and special features in the reader, swipe from left (from inside a book) and I now have easy access to go back to my library, pick a chapter, search, and more.  Speech recognition - I love how I can now speak my notes instead of typing when reading a book.  The speak feature is located on the keyboard - microphone icon - and so I have been able to use it to speak notes in other applications. The speech recognition is extremely accurate.  This feature alone is worth buying the FIRE HD.  Autocorrect - I had an issue with the autocorrect, it was over zealous, so I quickly turned it off by pressing the space bar and accessing the keyboard settings.  There are other settings for the keyboard, like split keyboard for thumb typing, keyboard sounds, auto-capitalize, check spelling, trace typing, next word prediction, and more.  Other Language Keyboards - The keyboard settings have other settings like adding another language to the keyboard, which I needed when typing Spanish.  I can toggle between the two keyboards EN (English) and ES (Spanish) by pressing the EN or ES on the keyboard's space bar and then selecting the other language.  Very easy.  Wishlist for me on the keyboard would be to have an insert date button.  If you are ordering for a special occasion, don't wait until the last minute.  I ordered it on May 8 and was told it was back-ordered until June 9, but it was shipped early and I received it on May 22. This tablet was for me, so the back-order did not create a problem.  Additionally, I used my reward points from another credit card and was able to reduce the sale price even more.  Amazon makes it very easy to apply reward points from multiple resources.  I did notice that when using the highlight feature while reading books, with this version, I must click twice instead of once to highlight a note.  Before, in the previous version, the highlight color was just there, now you must access the color menu and select a color from a drop down menu.  Not a deal breaker, more of a nuisance.  I am still learning about this tablet, but for now I am impressed and glad I made the purchase.  This is my opinion, thank you, WP."
"I purchased the item merely to read books, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is so convenient with its touchscreen. The only regret I have is that I did not purchase it earlier."
"Amazing, good quality screen."
"Maybe one star is a little harsh but I'm pretty frustrated with it. The format in which it runs is not user friendly. My 3yr old has a Samsung tablet and flys thru it no problem, he gets super frustrated trying to play with this one. I struggled setting this thing up. And now that I've downloaded 7 free games took 6 pictures and one 35sec video the memory is full. And when the memory is full for whatever reason you can't log onto the Internet. I'm not a tech savvy person but basic operations thru most tablets is do able, this one however is too complicated. I think it only has 5gigs of internal memory?!?"
Love it! I'm  thoroughly enjoying my ebooks and surfing the web. Great little tablet.
"A great price, for a great product...Thank you!"
Love it! Easy start up. Able to transfer my library over without a problem. Love the color and all the apps. Very happy with my Fire.
I received this as an anniversary gift after my other one broke and was not able to be repaired. I love the way this one is setup and if one need any support I now know that now I'm  just one click away from Amazon's help support.
Everything about it is great with the exception of using it outside.  The screen is impossible to see because of the glare.  Still not use to the size after using an iPad.
Absolutely love screen makes it so easy to read in all settings
"I really like my fire.  I like the HD display, reading books and playing an occasional game.  However, I would appreciate not having to deal with annoying ads every time I do something or make a move on my Kindle. Very frustrating."
"Great tablet for the price!  Thus was to replace an older,  broken kindle and it works great...just as expected! One minor concern and customer service took care of it promptly."
I'm actually watching it right now! I love it. It's my second Kindle I've been thru. First one wouldn't charge anymore. Can that be fixed? I couldn't live without one. And I'm gaga obey the color. Thanks Amazon and Kindle.
Love it.  It's my new best friend!!!  I never leave home without it!!!
Wish I had got more memory... Doesn't hold much
"I'm elderly, not sure what I expected, because I've not had a tablet before. I'm disappointed that there is no flash for the camera. I have difficulty finding information online, is there a &#34;Kindle Fire 7 for Dummies&#34;? Maybe I'll be happier with the Fire as I learn more about it. In the meantime, I'm struggling with it!"
Loving it
I love everything about my fire hd!
It is great . I am enjoying it
"Love it! Bright pictures, good sound and easy to use."
"I love that the screen is big enough to read comfortably, without being too big to carry.  The sound quality is amazing when playing music, too. I am completely satisfied with my Fire HD 7."
I am very disappointed.
"Love my new Fire HD 7, I have a 2nd gen  that I passed on to my grandson. I loved my first one also. My new one has more space so I can download a movie or two."
I'm having a great time with this item. Very easy to navigate. Clear colorful screen. Videos play smoothly. Text is easy to read. Works great with my amazon prime membership.
Didn't work into the 2nd week of owning it. Only way to power it up is by plugging it into a wall socet.
"Fire HD 7.7 good, nice compact tablet and a very worthy price. Hope next edition come with micro-sd card slot for expanding data."
"I'm still playing with it ,but I'm learning. I love the portability of it.Haven't had any problems so far. Keep you posted."
Very pleased
Just what i was looking for
Love it!!!
I would recommend it.
Love the stereo upgrade and hd capability.
"i love this tablet. beautiful display, decent sound. perfect for watching movies when husband has commandeered tv."
"Exactly what I needed. Great display, enough functionality."
It a good table
Absolutely no problems.
"I had a first generation kindle fire which stopped holding a charge after 3 years or so.  This one is far superior - the keyboard is much more accurate.  I've had it about 2 months now, and am quite fond of it.  And for around $100, it cannot be beat.  We have an iPad 3d generation and the two are not really comparable.  The fire is much better for reading, and because it is affordable, I do things like take it to the gym so I can watch Nexflix while on the eliciptic or into the kitchen for cooking.  So, it's perhpas less a &#34;computer&#34; than the iPad, but it's more a part of my everyday life."
Great great great did I say Great price...
"Great basic tablet! Affordable, durable, and does everything you need it to."
Love it perfect size and great price
"While not as friendly as I had hoped, the speed and efficiency more than make up for the extra time I need to figure out how to get from one place to another."
I really like my new Kindle Fire HD 7.  This is my third device and it has exactly what I lacked in my others.
Performed as expected.
My mom loves it.
"Replaced an original kindle, Huge improvement!"
This is my second one and I simply love it. I hardly ever use my laptop.
The main negative is that this tablet has no app with a driver for my Lexmark pro 200 printer.  I purchased this tablet so I could print emails and documents and now find out that I can't print anything....
Love it
Great
Love it
Perfect packaging to keep it protected.  Color was true to advertised. Perfect size for an older child with great features.
this my second kindle and I love it.<br />wouldn'et be without it.
"I like it a lot and use it everyday.  I love reading different books and enjoy a game some times. Thankfully,  Sherry"
The Colo is beautiful and the backlighting makes it easier to read.
Love the front and rear facing camera!  Great resolution...videos are really clear.  This is my 3rd kindle and they just keep getting better.
It is an awesome tablet. I does just what I need it to do for my mother in law
"I love this Fire HD 7...  It works GREAT as one would expect!<br /><br />There is only ONE thing that I was disappointed about...  After seeing the Kindle in motion (my wife has one), and being impressed and really LIKING the MayDay Help system for immediate one-on-one help from a LIVE person... with them actually taking control of the Kindle to solve problems....  I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that the FIRE DOES NOT have that feature!  You have to basically handle it like with an email!<br /><br />Other than that, it's wonderful & a real JOY to use...  Love it!"
"Great device but not quite enough memory to be fully useful without a Wi-Fi connection.<br /><br />Needs a Micro SDXC slot to allow adding movies or other material beyond the miniscule by todays standards of ~4gb usable memory. Also one really annoying nag, can't get rid of the Dutch Language dictionary and references that are forced in by Amazon! They claim they should be in English.  Now I can't read Dutch, but the titles indicate Dutch and the contents certainly ain't any English dialect I have ever tried to read.<br /><br />Audio output without ear buds is adequate."
I wish you had real instructions.  I spent at least an hour on the phone with a very nice customer service rep but I woiuld rather have a good manual.
"First tablet, was very easy to start up and fun too. I am stuck on the game playing, really addictive and entertaining."
If only it had the Google Play store instead of Amazon's s***y app store.
"Even better than my old Kindle. The speed, resolution and ease of use makes it perfect for me."
Great
Best tablet for the price.  I love my fire 7
Never won  any thing like  this
I had never used a Kindle and I am learning how to use it. I think it is great as I won't have to be running to the library.
"The Fire HD 7 is not particularly stylish, but the screen is a beauty (1280x800 pixels) - very bright and vibrant colors. The 7&#34; size is perfect for e-book reading since the tablet is extremely light and easy to hold in one hand. I got mine during a one-day sale for $99, which was $60 dollars off the standard price of $159. You might also want to consider the Fire HD 6 with a slightly smaller screen at the $99 standard price. The battery lasts me all day easily while playing games, watching videos and reading e-books. All in all, this is a great little tablet!"
Great and affordable.
Love it.
"Great.  Many nice features, especially &#34;collections&#34; where I can organize my items.  Only wish power switch were not so flush with the surface, it's a bit tricky to turn off & on."
So much better than my 2012 version
this is better than a I pad just love it
Love it...reading..apps and movies
Very easy to use
"Will not play well with others, content limited by Amazon . Back she goes!"
So far love it!!  Hope the battery life is better.
"I've had the fire hd7 for three days now. The size is ideal and it is very handy for reading and completing tasks online. The only knocks so far are the lack of some apps that I'm used to having from the Play store - what'sapp, line, google maps, clash of clans & various other games, and some banking/financial apps."
Really like it
I love mine so I surprised my husband with this one. He is not technology savvy but after a quick tutorial from me he was off and running and hasn't put it down since!
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!! THe Fire HD 7 gives me a new kindle and tablet all in one and it's great!"
Love it !  I can do everything I can do on my pc and it is user friendly.  Plus I can read my books and take pictures.  Wonderful tool.... and toy.
i like it
It is very good it does every thing I want it to do.
I love it but what were the extras?
"for the price, it is good. It is a little clunky on movement in graphics. For example, the game 2048 is very smooth on my iPhone, but jerky on the Fire."
"I am still learning to use my Fire, but, I can honestly say that I love it. It does everything I expected it to do and more. I like the freedom it gives me to either read my books, look at Facebook or Pinterest or my email.<br />So, I recommend a Fire to everyone."
Good. Still getting to know what I have and how to use it.
I love it!
I love it
Very Nice.  Would like more instructions with it.  Hard to chase down grand kids to help :0)
Wanted one for a long time. Caught a good deal and jumped on it. It is great.
Fantastic piece of technology
I LOVE my new Fire!!!
Good item works pretty good
"My mom bought this for my 9 year old daughter. We were going to buy her an iPad, but since the cost was more than double, we decided to try the Fire HD 7 out instead and so far have been pleased with it. She mainly goes on it to play games when we are out and about, so my review is only based on that, but pleased anyhow."
"Amazon is bugging me to review this tablet, so I will. But I have only had it a short time, so don't base any buying decision on what I say. I got it for two reasons: it was on sale, and my iPad 2 is aging and eventually will be passe. I like the size, which is smaller than my iPad, but bigger than my iPhone. It is a little less useful than my iPad for bookreading via Kindle and viewing photos and videos. But it is easier to lug around. The Android operating system works fine and the apps I use most are available, so no problem there. Remains to be seen whether tech support will be as good as Apple Care, which is superb. After more time to actually use the device I may revisit this review."
"Great device!  I prefer it by far over my wife's and son's earlier versions.  I do need to learn how to recall books purchased earlier, and possibly some other activities, but that comes with any new device.  The color is superb, the &#34;Bookery&#34; font is very readable, and the device is easy to work with.  I haven't begun to push it.  I'm especially happy with 16Gb of memory.  We have earlier devices with only 8Gb or smaller, and many of them are becoming completely full."
Love my Kindle Fire. Thanks
Love my kindle fire...i am always on it...especially reading all the great books amazon has to offer
I went from an e-reader to the kindle fire and I can't believe everything I can do! I love it.
Yes it what I was expecting
love it
"So far so good.  Ask me in a year.  I like the magenta a lot - it's a lot more visible than my previous black.  I love the camera in comparison with the one on my previous kindle, except for it asking me if I want paid cloud storage EVERY time I open it.  I would much rather be the initiator, when I feel it is needed. As a matter of fact, there are  upgrades on almost all the functions and programs, and I am enjoying all of them.  The kindle even feels much better fitted for holding, although my older one never caused me to think it could be improved.  I have not had a reason - yet - to find out if flash player is compatible with this version of FIRE.  The only downside that I know of for sure is that this version does not automatically direct me to the Kindle Unlimited shopping directory, although it could be a error in my preferences as easily as a directory lack.  So far, so good!"
Love it
"not as good  as I expected it to be,  first  I was charged for a 30 day free trial  of Prime,  that was supposed to be free for 30 days... next  after you llsten to the music  you cancel,  and cancels  all listening of music  you but on it......."
"It's overall performance is good, but the battery consumption is not so good."
"I love this ....perfect,cip,beautiful...."
Extremely disappointed in the short battery life.  Playing downloaded games for very short periods of time entirely drains the battery even when not connected to wi-fi. Device requires recharging after only an hour of game-playing.
"Great for reading, playing games and going on the Internet. Small enough to carry but screen is big enough to easily see everything on the screen."
Rueheyeueue
"I will not recommend it I am going to keep my old Kindle it is easier to use this new one will not allowed you to move to new book till you write a review, not easy to navigate, I am thinking of sending it back, I am very sad and disappointed by it."
I bought 2. My granddaughters love them!
"So far, so good!"
It's not as organized as I would like but enjoy using it almost daily.
"I'm editing my rating. After using the Fire for a while, I&#34;v come to realize that it's not all that bad. My expectations were too high when I got it.  What a colossal disappointment!  ... Lastly, the screen is completely unusable outdoors. Even on overcast days the screen is all but impossible to read/see."
"Loved it a lot, but I am still learning some of the new stuff. bought it mainly for the Rear Cam. and the price was right for me also."
"I had high hopes for this kindle fire but unfortunately when I tried it after receiving it, I turned it on and only used it for about 20 minutes and it got so hot I had to shut it off.  I tried to email amazon and tell them about it and to try and find out what to do but they said that I had to talk to someone over the phone.  The only problem with that is I don't have a phone, so it has been sitting in the package it came in since I got it!  I'm so disgusted I don't even know what to do!  Even if they would have chat available my computer is messed up and won't let me stay online long enough to do that and obviously I can't use the kindle for chat either!  Amazon, really I am so disappointed, I am stuck with this thing that I can't even use!"
I love my mind del and don't go anywhere without it.  I just updated to the newest version due to the rear facing camera .  Totally recommend the kindle
"I purchased this when it was first released. It was a great buy for the price. The display is a good size for reading. The Fire allows the user to change the font and spacing to the reader's preference. Magazines are great and allow for bookmarking. Nice variety of apps to choose from. If you intend to do a lot of typing, an add on keyboard would be nice. Would definitely buy again!"
Very fast shipping. Love this just wish the battery life was better.
The power button is to small. I have a hard time finding it. Then the volume goes down out of no where. I've gotten with best buy and they won't help. Could you?
For the price it is and excellent little tablet.  For on your purse for travel. With a few more features wouldn't need a laptop.
"The Fire HD7 is a high end novelty item. The proprietary OS and browser are abysmal at best. If your level of technology usage is beyond just email and online surfing, avoid this product at all costs. The interface is clunky and self defeating. The app store is lacking and the unavailability of crossover apps from Android is sad. The apps that are allowed into store are somewhat useless and limiting. A very disappointing issue is the way most of what is available online for edification and entertainment is verboten since the browser doesn't allow for streaming unless it's Amazon Prime or Amazon movies. To have to sideload an app to be able to use certain productivity programs or simply watch YouTube is ridiculous. Had the price for.this not had been decent, I would behoove you to go with a real Android OS tablet. This has been a debacle for me and I wish my research would have been more thorough. I use Drop box and Google drive to store my tech documents and PDF's for work. This unit has such difficulties doing the most simple things and seems to be only a stepping stone towards a real tablet. I'm savvy with tech and this has me pulling my hair out. To make matters worse, if you need to engage tech support be prepared to spend hours dealing with out-sourced contractors from India/Pakistan/Philippines. Whatever happened to using Americans to support an American (theoretically) product. Overall a waste of money, time and effort. I'd never buy another one unless a gun was to my head. Might be worth it if I just read Kindle books."
LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE!
I like the speed and the size.  I think this is great product at the price.
I love it!
"I returned mine after one week.<br />1. The case is too slippery and it makes the unit prone to dropping. An expense of $40.00 to purchase a non-slippery case.<br />2.,The commercials at start up are irritating and the fact that it costs $15.00 to get rid of them is doubly irritating.<br />3. The USB charger cable is too short. Another $10.00 extra expense to purchase a decent length cable.<br />4. The unit is a bit too wide to be held in one hand comfortably, the slipperiness adds to this issue.<br />5. Battery life is shorter than advertised.<br />6. My first generation Kindle Fire lasted four years before the mini USP port broke and the unit will no longer charge.<br />7. I don't see this replacement as being an improvement over my original Kindle Fire."
"Love this device. It replaces a third gen Fire which I loved also, but this one is faster and has some extra features that my other one didn't."
Great my 2nd one
I love it because the battery last for a long time. I have dropped mine so many times and it still has not broken it is very durable
Love it so far!
"Really like this kindle , bought this one for the wife. Upgrade to the 16 gig well worth it"
"Pretty good, having no problems yet and you can't beat that price."
"Great product that is very durable and easy to operate and also worth the price. I like the fact that the guide is built in for the user's convenience. Music sounds great on it, as well as movies.  Would recommend to others. The only drawback is the battery life, it goes down too quickly for me."
It is all that I expect. I love it.
"For the money it is wonderful.  Easy to use, just great , even automatically spell corrects for me.  See!"
"So far I love my 7&#34; fire, super fast and the size is perfect. Would recommend to anyone who needs a small reader tablet"
No comment at this time.
My son loves his kindle.
The Kindle Fire was very easy to set up and already synced with my other kindle. Easy to navigate and books are much easier to read.
Received in a timely fashion.  A Very Pleased Customer... THANK YOU 😍.
Great tablet.....got it for a steal at $79
used by a 4 yo also and she loves it Amazon for kids is amazing.  I think it packs a nice punch for small tablet
I love my kindle!!!!
It was a gift  for my big sister and she said she loved it
Love the look and feel of this case. I was worried it would look cheap but it doesn't at all. I also love that the kindle goes to sleep when you close the case.
Great tablet for the money. It works great and it fits great in your hands!!
I will inform all of my friends who dount have one to get one it help me alot not to large just wright size to carry around inyour hand
Love it.
My kids love it and I love it.  It freed up my laptops.
Incredible display
works
"Best tablet I have ever used. Great display, user friendly. Only down fall is not having the ability to use a micro SD card for extra memory."
so glad we got this device its just great
I have the first generation kindle fire but decided to upgrade & love the new kindle fire hd 7. The new features are great. The speech to text is great. The only way I could listen to books with the old kindle is if I bought audible audio books. I also love the new cover design that lets you use it as a stand so you can read but keep both hands free.
"This is not the version with the &#34;special offers,&#34; or if it is, I haven't seen any yet.  The display is very bright and colorful and navigation is easy to learn. The books are back-lit and easy to read in all lightings.  The browser is quick, and when I click &#34;Search&#34; I immediately get a virtual; keyboard and the Search space increases in size.  I have not yet used the cameras or tried to Skype. Very glad I bought it."
I'm enjoying it. So far I love it
I've run into a lot of problems with downloading apps that don't work for kindle
good product
This kindle is great. I have a paper white kindle too but this one I can check my e-mails go on Facebook. It is so much easier to use and bring with you than a laptop. I love it. I even read on it too.
Very satisfied with my new Fire HD 7. Received this as a Mother's Day gift and have already spent hours on it.
Excellent piece of technology
I am so very disappointed in this Kindle seven fire or three books from Norway a dictionary on this that no one can dip late I am so disappointed I am going to return it if this issue is not resolved by Tuesday
Awesome! Just an amazing device.
Love my Kindle!!!  Great price and great quality!!!
HD7WAS MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED.FROUNT AND REAR CAMERA WAS A KNOCKOUT..THE DISPLAY WAS NICE AND BRIGHT CLEAR.PERFECT FOR WATCHING MOVIES.THIS PASSES THE HDX THAT I HAVE WITH ONLY REAR CAMERA.THIS PRODUCT WILL REPLACE MY OLD LAPTOP.THE PRICE WAS RIGHT FOR SUCH AN EXCELLENT TABLET.5 STARS TO YOU AT AMAZON.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
"Was best birthday present ever ,perfect for reading ,playing games, going on web and to do some shopping"
Having hard time with the camera and my gallery from other kindle have no way to get it transferred to this devise.
"A BARGAIN, BUT MY WIRELESS CONNECTION FAILS AUTHENTICATION -BUT, THAT'S MY PROBLEM."
"Love, Love, Love My Kindle Fire HD 7. It's so easy to use. In addition to reading I play games, follow social media, watch movies, take pictures and listen to music. It's so easy to take with me anywhere."
"I don't even know how to rate this. How long is a battery charge supposed to last? I have to recharge every 5 (!!!!) hours! Is that normal? Because I like everything else about it, but will return it if the battery is that short-lasting.<br />And, I HAVE read tips on conserving energy, but the thing still sucks energy up way too fast."
I love it.
Great product and my son loves it.
Realty nice dark blue
"Lots of features, convenient size, good value for the price!"
I like the functions of the Kindle however I do not like the idea that I have to pay to get rid of the advertisement. I would rather have my own background instead of seeing a whole bunch of advertisement that I have to click through.
Good.<br />Don't work with Chromecast
"I am a techno-gadget geek. I love all things electronic! I loved my iPad Air, still love my iPad 2 mini, had a nook tablet,  and still have a Kindle Fire 3rd generation. But I think this Fire HD 7 may be my new favorite. It's light, crisp and clear, easy to use, and has a beautiful layout format...$99 CAN buy happiness."
"The fire tablet is excellent. However I purchased it, and 1 year of Prime, to take advantage of the Amazon streaming video collection. Unfortunately, I live in Costa Rica and am not allowed to access the video library. So, it was a waste of $200 for me..."
"It's user-friendly and much faster than I expected. I haven't found any caveat, except for the one the most people point; which is the fact that there is no Google Play store app."
"I like this Kindle quite well and find myself using it in preference to two earlier Kindles which remain operable.  The new unit provides faster page turns and fewer unintended page turns.  It feels a little lighter.  It is slippery as hell, and I quickly bought a padded case at Walmart.  It has a big enough battery, as i read a 400 page novel on one battery charge.  Disabling WiFi is easy;  other Kindles bury this important function in the menu tree. Enabling and disabling screen rotation is also easy.  It has front and rear cameras, but I have not tried them yet.  Text looks just as readable as text on my my older monochrome reader, which I seldom use now.. Color pictures look great--better than on my computer screen.  I am glad I upgraded to the newer Fire, which Amazon made possible by offering a deep discount."
works great as an e-reader and tablet
Love it!!!!!
Very nice tablet
I don't know why I waited so long to get a kindle fire tablet. I'm really loving the speed and convenience of the tablet. It's everything that I wanted.
love the HD display & more apps to play with
"I really like the Kindle Fire HD Oct. 2014 Edition so far, I have only had it a couple of days. Great upgrade from the 2012 Kindle Fire HD.  Great buy for the money. I recommend it to all my frrends."
As expected. Easy to use. Recipient is enjoying it.
"This was a gift for mother's day and - simply put - I LOVE it!  Once I got my sea legs and figured out all the little nuances - which really took no time at all - it was a breeze, and I'm amazed at how powerful, easy to use, and versatile this little bundle of joy is.  Thank you to my kind donor, and thanks, Amazon, for an excellent product.  (Now I just need some of the extra toys and gadgets that go with it to make this even greater!)"
Great reading tool that includes a bright light illumination to make reading anywhere always possible.  All book passages are always clear and reading breaks are easy to track to resume reading.
Love it. Great birthday gift.
Would be 5 stars but i'm waiting to see if the connections for the charger inside the kindle stay in tact as it did as it did not with the last 3 kindles I've had. Hope this problem has been addressed in this version. I really like the compactness of this unit. It is lighter in weight than older versions and fits nicely into a pocketbook.<br />  Another concern I had was that my previously purchased apps are nowhere to be found when all were transferred to the cloud from my old kindle 7. Only the free apps are there. What's up with that ?
I loved the Bible that's downloaded I haven't had kind to read anything yet but will do do shortlt
"The tablet visual is great, easy to use, plenty of free apps, battery life sucks.  Stronger battery would make this tablet perfect!"
Didn't like it can't use Bluetooth or network have 2 have wifi bs
Love it!  Can't put it down.
Easy to use. I love it.
No directions on use especially for  a no -computer savvy person. HVe plans to return unit.  Unacceptable  Leon E. Herson
"No longer love this kindle. It is very slow the battery drains quickly. In an hour it will go from 100% to 70%. Also gets extremely hot. Would love to know what changed.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Love my Kindle Fire HD 7. 7&#34; Easy to use, light weight.<br />I have downloaded books and games. With the front and back facing camera it's easy to Skype with friends and family.<br /><br />Highly recommend."
"Fast enough to stream TV programs off the web, large enough to see easily.<br />Anton"
I'm very pleased with the way it performs and the speed I'm able to download different things on my tablet.
I enjoy it very much just learning how to use it
No
The new Fire is awesome.
"Depending on what you want to use your tablet for, this may be a good tablet.  We got it at a great price, and I can see where it would be a fine tablet for people who only use Amazon for their electronic entertainment.  But for us, it was clear within 24 hours that we were going to have to return it.<br /><br />Some background: Our older daughter has had a Nook HD tablet for a few years now, but most of her reading has been done on the Kindle app so we thought we would go with a Kindle Fire for our younger daughter now that she is old enough for her own tablet.<br /><br />With the Nook, we could shop around for apps -- we could buy Android apps from the Barnes and Noble website or Google Play, and either way they would run (providing we had the right version on Android, of course).<br /><br />Not so with the Kindle -- the selection of apps is severely limited since we can only go through the Kindle app store and not Google Play at all.  Plus,we were so disappointed to find out that several of my daughter's favorite Android games were incompatible with Amazon's proprietary version of Android.  Software developers consider their version of Android to be so different that it is it's own category of operating system.<br /><br />Plus, we found the Fire to be very glitchy in terms of downloading and installing books/apps -- it would say that something had been downloaded, but it wasn't _really_ all the way done, and so when we tried to open something, it would freeze part way through.  This would happen several times before we could finally get things to open consistently.  Rebooting didn't really help.  It was especially bad on the kids' profiles under the Free Time app.  Initially I was excited about Free Time, but I discovered that everything has to be downloaded and set-up twice... once under the adult profile and the once under Free Time.  That, combined with the glitchiness, meant it was very slooooow going to get this set up.<br /><br />We also found the lack of external buttons VERY frustrating.  My daughter has read many books using the Kindle app on her sister's tablet, but when she was reading books on the Fire, we had a lot of trouble finding a way to EXIT the reading app.  The menu just wouldn't appear when we swiped... And there are no external buttons to allow the user to force a return to the home screen...So we'd just be trapped in the book, alternately trying swipes from the top, bottom, sides, etc.<br /><br />Plus, the battery would drain very quickly (at 40% brightness on the screen, not running video or anything graphics intensive, and it was still dropping about 15% per hour).<br /><br />I really love shopping on Amazon... I wanted to like this tablet, truly!  But we're returning it to go get a different tablet, and then we'll just download the Kindle app on it for reading the books we love."
Great product. Good deal just disappointed in the ads every time I use it
"Good on most everything. Collection and book/media management might be better (I have over 200 books in my account now and climbing).Main complaint is that some things on android market are missing from amazon app market and also that chromecast does not seem to work or be available so that I can cast videos from amazon and netflix to my chromecast device on my TV. I know Amazon has a similar device, but this seems like an unreasonable crippling of an expected functionality. Don't want to have to change around devices on my TV whenever I use a different device to cast."
Love the Kindle.  My 3rd one.  Very easy to setup.
I enjoy the this third Fire
I hive it 5 stars.  Very happy with it.  Faster and charges in less time. I can print with this now.
"Yes, like it. Light weight and is fast. Like the color too! Can take pictures with this and get to them very easy."
Love my kindles LOL though I keep losing them!
"I'm mostly satisfied with my latest Fire (#5!), except for one thing that is truly annoying:  the power button doesn't work if the device is completely off (not just sleeping) - I have to connect it to the charger to turn it on.  This could really piss me off if I'm not somewhere where I can plug it in, and it means I have to carry the charger around with me if I leave home.  Whar's the deal with this?"
Love this tablet! Fits right in my hands and simple to use. Very clear screen and vibrant colors
So far so good.  Internet and Netflix work fine and the sound and display are great
Everything that I expected.
Love this device
Truly have enjoyed my new kindle fire 7
"This was a gift.I love the display,and its very user friendly. I also love the space,for me its perfect."
Think I am going to really enjoy this.  There is a learning curve and I have not mastered it yet but the Amazon support folk have been really great at helping me. I really like being able to have different colored backgrounds and the lighted screen.  Really good if you like to read in bed.  This is my first experience with Touch Screen so for some the learning curve would be less difficult.
It did not come with a users manual.  I am not computer savvy.  I am having trouble figuring how to download things
"This is my third Kindle Fire.  I absolutely love it.  The previous ones were great, but this is even better. I was so happy to be able to keep my favorite games.  I love the camera feature too."
"I'm very happy with it. It's just the right size for my kindle Fire,fits perfectly. Unlike the Fintie case, which was too small."
"I love it,"
I purchased this for my son as a birthday gift.  The parental controls are difficult at best to manage.  There are fewer apps and games available through Amazon than other stores and the parental apps available are a joke.  My advice is to spend a little more and get a lot more with a tablet that connects to either Google Play or itunes.  I missed the return date by 2 days or I would have returned this device.
This tablet has met or exceeded all of my expectations.  I'm glad I only had to spend $99 to get what I thought was going to cost me at least $299 for any other tablet.
Amazing
"I like it a lot. It was given to me and I'm still trying to learn it but so far, I like it."
"I am so pleased with my new Fire HD 7, 7&#34; HD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black. I upgraded from the last generation of Kindle Fire and am so happy I did. Despite the special offers which only appear when you turn on your Fire HD 7, I find this to be the best little gadget I have owned from Amazon. I purchased the HD Fire 7 cover that allows it to go into sleep mode when you close the case and turns it on when you open the case. Battery life is great. The camera is crisp and easy to use, the apps are awesome. You can't go wrong with this purchase. And I snagged it on sale for $79 from Amazon which is bonus!"
I really like it a lot.  I have been reading more because it's so much easier to see the book on the screen.  Highly recommend this product. I have Kindle on my laptop but it is too bulky to lay back in bed and read. The Kindle fire is also very fast. I hate waiting for something to load on my computer. This is much better.
"Never owned a tablet in my life, so i think I made a good choice to start with."
So happy with this device. Crystal clear screen. All my favorite apps load and operate very quickly. Was going to install a non-Amazon browser but the Silk browser operates flawlessly.  My only complaint is that the power cord supplied is short requiring you be near an electrical outlet for extended device use but that is easily solved by purchasing a longer corded power cable.  What they REALLY got right: Moving the power port to the top of the device! No more being stabbed in the stomach or having to change rotation.
TV app performance improved
love it
Great upgrade from the last series. Love the Skype with the wife going to Thailand for a month in 10 days. Amazon rocks......
I would love to have another at the price I paid. Is there a way to notify me when it goes on sale again?
Love it. So much easier to read then  my Kendall touch even though I loved it too!
"This 7&#34; tablet gives just the right combination of portability and viewability. Proprietary OS requires some getting used to, but once acclimated, operation is smooth and efficient. I am particularly impressed with how nicely it manages email."
It's pretty sharp.  I'm still getting used to it.
Love it
Love the Kindle Fire!!! Fast with such a fantastic screen!!
"I'M very happy with the purchase of this item, is fast light and very clear. I just love it."
Awesome!  My first tablet & I'm not disappointed.
this is garbage
"This is a great little device. I haven't had time to check it out fully but seems to be very responsive, great color, and not bad internet speed! I love it so far!"
"Great investment. I removed the ads for the extra $15 shortly after getting it (it gets annoying immediately), got a great case, car mount, and I now know that my 3 year old and I have a solution to entertainment problems on long trips for a long time. The ability for it to receive WiFi can be a bit sketchy at times but I mostly use it on airplane mode. Battery life is as expected. It will last quite a while on standby (over a week) and will easily withstand Frozen being watched 5 times...in a row...before getting critical battery levels. Definitely a buy! Takes a little bit to get used to, but it's great for what I use it for."
I've always loved the Fire....easy to use....warranty is great....customer service easily guides you if problems arise.
Met all of my expectations. I love it!
Love it
"I love it, it's not to big  and it fits in my purse. It's not to small, I have watched several movies and the picture, sound quality were just amazing. Definitely a great investment for me and my on the go personality."
"Love the display, backlighting and colors!  Great to read with.  Fun to play games on and get my email.  So good, I bought one for my hubby"
I like it a lot. The resolution is great.
It does a lot more than the first generation kindle.
👍
"But your really need to put some kind of instructions with it, for folks like myself(senior) I had to have my grand daughter show me how to use it.<br />But the device itself is really nice. Thank you"
"Kindle Fire NEVER dissapoints! This is my second Fire, and I could not be happier."
love it. this was a present for my husband who is not very tech savey and he really enjoys using his Fire tablet.
love the new set up!
"Haven't explored all the options yet, but it looks like a promising start."
I love my hd fire. Would purchase again.
Will stick with my iPad....on my second one after threatening to dump Amazon prime membership....the second one makes the same popping noise as the first one.  Absolute garbage...I'd return it again but it's after the return period...would end up with a refurbished unit.  Won't be buying another.
Love it.  Easy to setup and transfer files
We love it and it solved the problem of my husband and I having to share the original Kindle
Love it!
Would recommend this product to anyone.
"Wonderful little tablet. Has all of the capabilities that I have loved in Kindle since my original Kindle and then the first Kindle Fire. Now I can share with one person, my wife, and we can easily discuss the same book.  I may wish I had gotten the 16G version later on but for now I am happy as a clam!"
Love it
"Bought this for my 14 year old for Christmas and I love the parental controls. I allow him to download books and apps appropriate for his age. I also love that I can choose what apps he has access to such as the web browser. I would recommend this for anyone with kids. The screen is nice and bright, when watching movies the screen is crystal clear. Delivery was fast, worth every penny spent."
"It's a great product, it all ways let me download games, Books and other stuff.The only time it did not let me download games is because I did not have enough money"
Happy wife happy life
great product
Didn't realize it would cost to remove the special offers feature...  Would cost $15 to remove.  Stinks because my 7 year old can't change the lock screen from something that every time he turns it on it shows a game that he &#34;has to have&#34;...  Causes a lot of frustration on the parent end.
I bought it as a reader and to play a few simple games.  Works great for what I wanted.  does even more than what I expected.
"Very good.  Did not have instructions included, which was a little inconvenient"
After a setback by purchasing the wrong Kindle Fire I am now very happy with my purchase.  I purchased this to upgrade my 1st generation Kindle Fire.  I am loving the HD on this one.<br />My only complaint was it took over 10 days to receive.
Met All my needs
"WE now own three Kindle Fires HD. The newest one only has 8 mg but seems to be keeping up with the other and their 16 mg. Just thrilled with the ease of these devices (hence, owning three!) Love Amazon in general."
Love the Fire HD7. Beautiful screen very easy on the eyes.
It's more than I expected.
"I've had my Kindle Fire 7 - 4th generation for a couple of weeks now.  So far, it's just OK.  What I DO like is the screen - very sharp, clear images and videos.  Fair selection of apps.  What I don't like is short battery life, and awkward interface - particularly confusing is how to close apps!  Somewhat slow and laggy, although this is only the 8 GB version. Another con is that there is no slot for a memory card, so storage is limited.  Amazon claims you don't need more because everything is stored on the Cloud, but if I cannot access the cloud, that becomes an issue. I also have a Samsung Galaxy 3 8&#34; with 32 GB which runs circles around this tablet.  In fairness, the Samsung cost a lot more than this unit, but it is far more usable."
Easy to navigate
Really great tablet for the price
Just what I wanted! Love the large print for books and emails!
It does everything I need better than my old kindle fire. Except the battery isn't half as good my old kindel's battery after 3 years.
Very happy with new Fire which replaces my 3 year old Fire because of charging port breakage.  I have found this is a common problem with Kindles.  Hopefully newer versions are more sturdily built.  I got a great price on this new Kindle and the addition of camera is a plus.
Shipped on time.  It does everything as advertised. I'm new to the Kindle fire family. I bought this to see if I like it and I do. Excellent hd display and navigation. Great apps etc. Now I want to get the 8.9 with 4g and Wifi and more memory. If I upgrade I'll let my boys share this one. I also bought the cover that fits perfectly with it.  4 stars only because The power cord it a little short so it makes it difficult to use while plugged in.
A great buy on sale for $99.00. It has a quality feel about it and has great performance. I would say this is a great alternative to any Apple tablet. If you went on a dollar per performance basis this would easily beat almost every tablet out there.
This tablet is too limited.. some of my games not compatible with fire!  Disappointed.
So far it's ok. It took to long after ordering to be delivered.
need instructions.
"It is what I expected. I just wish it would come with a manual for us old folks. I hate the trial and error method, too time consumming."
Awesome
I LOVE MY FIRE HD7  DIDNT GET HUGH DONT WANT IT
"I needed to know if the Fire HD 7 had a virus protector ,I couldn't find the answer on the Web ( this is my first tablet) ,so I phoned customer service at 1 866 216 1072. The rep. said it has it's own protection. but I could also download an app. for this and she walked me through it step by step . Its GREAT service like this that makes Amazon the Best customer friendly business around."
Easy to use and the size is just right for reading books.
"IT IS FULLFILLING MY ESPECTATIONS,LOED IT AND STILL DO NOW,STILL EXPLORING POSIBILITIES.RECOMENDED."
"No it isn't an iPad and will take some use to feel comfortable but it is a nice alternative and cheaper: can do email, get on net (with wifi), and download books from a public library.  Some have complained about the advertising when you open to use but easily ignored.  I can't speak to the longevity nor durability."
Has even been better than I expected!  So love my Fire HD!
Kindles are tough.t  Our family has bought four Kindles over the years and only one has stopped working after five continuous years of use.
"Wife loves it, thanks!!!"
Delivered as expected in good condition very rapid service.
Not understanding how to many of the options
"Love it.  Purchased for a 6 year old for reading and learning games.  Dropped so many times i always expect that it will be the final time, yet theres been NO problems at all with it.  Great for kids!  Great product!"
LOVE IT!
Super fast and a great buy!
"This is the best deal out there!You have email,books,Internet,camera, Netflix capability, apps etc. It is clear and easy to read!<br />Love it!!!!!"
"I really like my new Kindle Fire HD. The clarity of video pictures and the camera function are awesome. It has apps that my first book didn't have and I'm exploring them. More important to me was the help I received from Amazon staff who closed down my lost book, got me set up on my new one and transferred all my information from one to the other. It saved e so much time and probably frustration."
"Completely satisfied for what I want it to do. Quick browse of internet, take to gym and use for watching videos, update on news. For the price I'm thrilled!"
Super Slow Keyboard
"I had avoided buying a tablet because of the high price so when I saw this offer ($99), I had to jump on it! The Kindle Fire HD 7, 7&#34; meets my expectations. It is pretty user-friendly, the picture quality is excellent and the case/stand I bought makes for easy hands-free viewing (perfect for recipe reading). There weren't any instructions printed (other than &#34;plug in&#34;), which was fine for me, but may be aggravating for someone older and accustomed to electronics coming with an instruction booklet. My only complaint is that I didn't get it in 2 days, as we receive everything else (with Prime)."
"The Fire HD is sturdy enough to survive my 6 year old. Picture is great, runs games well and it feels a lot sturdier than our old Fire."
I have had it less than a week - - I am still learning how to get around with the system . . . not &#34;as&#34; user friendly as I thought but will become clearer as more use occurs
"I have enjoyed it so far, but wish there was a book that came with it on all it will do and how."
Still trying to figure it out.  6 yr. old grandson trying to con me into give it to him.  Don't think so!  Will be downloading some books soon.
great product
I am having problems learning it & it has to be charged daily.
"This is the third Kindle I've purchased from Amazon. I absolutely love the way the camera feature (double sided) clear...just have to stay in brighter areas. The best bang for my buck was I got it on SALE. Would have gotten the the lte version, but I don't want AT&T service...should open it up to no contract options to invigorate sales...this sucker would fly then!"
Its an HD fire for $79 what else is there to say?
"Having a difficult time adjusting to a different OS on the Fire HD 7, as I have all Apple devices, i.e., iPhone, MacBook, etc."
"I love this tablet that was $79.00. I also have 10 inch ipad and lenovo tablets, but this is my preferred tablet as it does everything the others do but I like this smaller size even though it is thicker than the others."
Excellent
"Great device. Lots of ads but that doesn't really bother me. Love the display, it's extremely clear."
Love my new kindle?  Brighter back light.  Great for travel.  Much lighter than my IPad and have my wish list books on it.
"I love, love, love my kindle."
Love it.
great little tablet. you can't beat it for the money
Love it. Easy to do your reading. This is my second one.
A great product by Amazon.More than my expectations
"The most defining aspect of the Fire is its speed. Blazing fast loading of web pages.  The speakers are great as well. I've only had it for a couple of days, so I'm still climbing the learning curve. So far I'm very impressed.  I got it for my wife, and I need to familiarize myself with its operation so I can explain it to her, which is a great excuse for me to use it.  I have an 8&#34; Nextbook that I bought about 18 months ago for the same price (99.), but it is much inferior to the Fire. Much slower, insufficient volume on the speakers. The Fire is well worth the money spent."
Great for the price.  Does everything that the Samsung tablet does.
I love it
Awesome
What I love is its portability.  It fits in my purse and is handy for those times you have to wait at a doctor's office or getting your hair done.  The free books that are offered are a great plus as is the fact that Overdrive is available for connection to the local library.  My doctor actually recommended this reader for me since I tend to wake up at night and the light from my iPad tends to be too bright when one might just want to get back to sleep.  No glare and a light that is more eye friendly makes this a great reader!
This is Gen 4 which is a step above my Gen 2. Since I use mine purely for reading it is nice that the text is crisper and the background colors are richer. I prefer sepia which is excellent on the Gen 4.
"Met all expectations, easy to use"
2nd kindle.......very pleased
"I bought this item buying into Amazon's hype that it is the best tablet for under $100.00. It is very cheaply made. I dropped it onto the floor of my car from the driver's seat and from that point in time the thing never worked right again. I went pass the 30 day return policy so I wound up with a piece of junk not worth the metal and plastic from which it is made. OF COURSE, I could have bought the product warranty. You might consider buying another tablet from a company that will stand behind the product without having to buy a warranty, especially if you consider the things that you do with you tablet important."
"Impressive device, my first tablet. Works great and I like it."
Hope they fixed the usb port problem
It is my first tablet and it seems to work well.
I had bought another tablet and was u satisfied and wished I had bought a Fire.  So I gave the one away and bought the other.  And I love it.  It does everything I want and not a million others that I do not want.  Happy me.
"Not as intuitive as something from Apple, but the price on this was outstanding and it does all my wife wants from a tablet or computer."
love the new screen and the sound
What I expected!!
Love my Fire HD
My 5 year old grandson loves it!
"This was a gift for Mother's day.  My wife loves to  read the Outlander series and carrying one book, let alone the whole series is achore.  As much of a traditionalist she is, she's  a convert to the electronic book format now. Colors on apps are strong, as well as the browser is useful.  Highly recommended for any reading fan. Easy to use."
Love it use for everything from reading to surfing the net.
"Not what I thought it was, it had trouble connecting to the internet, after trying 9 times I repacked it and sent it back. I'm sure its a great little item, just not for me."
I love it!
"Bought 2 for my children, they have met all expectations, simple quick, and efficient."
happy with it
"I have never owned a tablet before, but found the price too good to pass up.  It is very convenient, especially for Skyping, but I preferred my basic Kindle for reading books-- I don't like the backlighting of the text.  I also find some of the apps more limiting than visiting the sites themselves--especially for Goodreads and Facebook."
I replaced my original Kindle (that I had lost) with this Kindle Fire HD 7 and I absolutely love it.  I am amazed by the versatility of this great mid-size device.  I really enjoy reading and I have purchased a LOT of books over the past several years since I was given my first Kindle.  I do my reading in a large size typeface and with my Kindle's lighted screen I have no eye strain ... I can read for hours at a time. I love being able to get my email and surf the web on this new device.
I just received it but so far it works great.
My husband loves it.
I always wanted one ......and now I do ...there are no words to describe how I feel..... I LOVE IT..... 1 very satisfied customer....
Purchased for my wife and she uses it all day long.
it works great and a wonderful price
"I love this tablet, brilliant display, good quality sound. I wish I had purchased the 16 GB instead of 8 GB so I'm careful on the apps I put on it but it's all I need for now. A great deal for the price! With all the free cloud storage that's available with Amazon Prime I don't need a lot of space on my device!"
It is a great upgrade from the original kindle fire. I love it.
I hesitated to move away from books.  How silly! Love this method of reading!
Down loading some non Amazon money makers Apps is a useless nightmare<br />Therefore I can't check some important web sites. Lots of problems<br />enabling sites in the brouser.Kindle has ya going around in circles<br />The kindle is a good reader a.d downloading Amazon stuff is fast and efficient.
Good features except for the silly camera that can only pictures of selfies.  Why bother!!
"I love it, but haven't figured out how to make it support POGO. Yes it is a nice little tool to keep up on current events and the free game downloads are good to keep me entertained."
"I Absolutely love this new Kindle Fire HD 7, I recently upgraded from the Kindle Fire HD 6 which is great no doubt about it but I am so glad I decided on the HD 7 (2014, 4th gen). I love that's it's bigger and much louder with the dual speakers. Also the way it's designed with the extra angle on the back side makes it sound great when you put it on the table. Both cameras take good quality pictures and the video is pretty good quality as well, no lagging, great sound overall awesome. I really like that they have the 5 color options. I ordered the white and it is crisp white and I love it! I ordered my husband the cobalt blue it's nice in dark lighting it almost looks purple but in the light it's clearly cobalt. I overall love this new design, speaker upgrade and size. It's fast and never lags when I'm.surfing the internet and I'm always using multiple tabs at once while listening to some music. It never fails me and you can't beat the warranty when you do have an issue.Also Amazon customer service always finds a way to satisfy my issues or complaints. The only thing that would make it better is if it was either compatible with Google Play or they had more of the same apps that the PlayStore has. Also the original charger/cord could definitely be longer but that's just me some.people don't use their devices while they're charging. My only issues and they're minor. :)"
I got this on special $79.00 so yeah not $139.00  this was for my mom its very light feels good in your hands looks great can change languages its loud better battery and brighter than my kindle fire. I didn't get to mess around with it as much as I liked because it was not for me. I own the old kindle fire not this Fire HD tablets heck mine does not even have a camera and It seems a great improvement to what I have and more options than before. BUT my issue is that it was for my mom and without amazon prime you don't get amazon instant video content for free she would have to set up her own amazon account and pay for her own amazon prime service not cool so I registered it under my account so she could watch it. Of course I don't want her messing with my content so I tried making her own profile but if its an adult it will tell you to make her an amazon account which again brings up the prime issue and if you do it as a kid profile its just garabage you have to select what they can and can't use and it pushes you a lot for the kindle free time for kids everything is very restricted if that is the case why even lend your kid the tablet but anyways this is for my mom and I want her to uses it so its under my account. I just wish I could control that she won't buy anything but I have not found anything that will ask for a code or a password to but things which is weird amazon instant video has that when renting a movie from the service why not on the tablet. I recommend to get the tablet without the promotions because sometimes  the add is like hiding in the background you go to one thing and you see a screen to download the app (game of war) then it disappears and takes you to where you going you go somewhere else and it you see it for a second.Like while it loads you would see the download page for the app.I take off one star because all you need to do is wait there will be a new tablet and it will be very similar and better and there you go all you need is one tablet. I still like my kindle fire 2nd generation and every year since I have been looking for an upgrade and still think I don't need one. I only got this because the price was so low and my mom wanted one so there ya go mom. Also I am one of those people who don't see the difference between hd and sd.et.

I loved my original Fire but was disappointed when the bag it was in got damp and the Fire died.  I like the Fire HD but am having difficulty getting used to it and it has a lot more unwanted ads that appear.  I downloaded free Spider Solitaire and the ads found me.  I removed the game but have an ad every time I open the tablet.
Great buy...
I just love it im now an amazon prime member and can watch movies read books unlimited  plus get great deals on items and two day shipping.
"Awesome, easy to use great for reading, videos, game playing. This has quickly became my favorite &#34;toy&#34;"
"Nice display, nice features.  Big problem is there is not enough memory.  I downloaded a few books, a couple of songs and a movie, and got a message that I was almost out of memory.  I am returning it and purchasing the 16 gb model instead."
Way faster than I expected and very versatile!  Exactly what I was looking for!
I bought this as a birthday present for me. I have wanted a Kindle for a long time. I am glad I waited. This one does everything I want it to do. I have watched shows on it. The picture and sound is good. I am enjoying reading books on here. I love how light it is to carry so I can travel with it. I am still learning what all I can do with it. It is easy to use.
operates as advertised.  Was a good buy.
It's great
"Mine died completely within 4 days of receiving it. Simply won't turn on, no matter what I try. Amazon will replace it, but apparently due to backorders it will be 6 to 8 weeks before I get it. Will re-review when I get one that actually works."
Very nice device...I also use it as a tablet along with a book reader....I have had other tablets but this far exceeds any previous one.
I like it. Its very user friendly
"Easy to use, very kid friendly."
I have the paper white but with the fire I can do so much more!!!
"why the change in how you remove apps from the Carrousel,"
Great
Works as expected. Wish the Amazon app store had more popular games. Battery lasts for a long time. Only really have to charge it if I've been on Netflix all day.
Can't access internet without WiFi.  No alternatives.
Great product
"This is one of the best values for a tablet as long as you are not into alot of gaming. The limited memory is the only draw back for the gamers and photo hounds. Needs a memory slot, or more internal memory . Fantastic for doing Skype on the two way cameras. The sound coming out of the TWO speakers is awesome when listening to your favorite music, movies or videos."
Love it! Everything is clear and easy to navigate.
"Love it!!! Works great, no problems at all!"
What a great Kindle!!! And for  the price was so good.  I love our Kindles
Good
Couldn't ask for anything better for the price.  I love it.<br />Ok
"I started my addiction with the first Kindle reader, got the first Fire when it was released, and now I've moved to the newest Fire. My older Fire is still wonderful, I just passed it on to my 7 year old. He LOVES it!<br /><br />Each generation gets better. This 4th generation Fire HD is nothing short of perfection. I should just have my Kindle surgically attached to my hand. I am never without it!"
I love collecting all my old favorite books. Plus I use it to watch Netflix or Youtube in bed.
Just what I expected
my wife loves this
Am enjoying my fire 7 but now and then it freezes up while I am in the process of playing a game.  I have to power off and back on in order to correct problem but meanwhile it loses my play.  This problem did not occur with my first Fire Kindle.
This is my second Kindle Fire and the FireHD is so much more than my original (3 yrs. old).  So far everything is faster and so clear.
Everything I expected it to be.  Well satisfied.
The fire hd7 is everything I thought it would be.  The display is sharp and clear and the sound is very good.  The speed at which it downloads books is very fast.  I am completely satisfied with my new fire hd7.  Thanks from making such a wonderful product.
this is kindle #2  #1 still going strong I bought #2 because of the deal of the day $75.00 was a price I could not pass up!
love it!
It will be a five star when once I learn all the features!
product is excellent -- the learning curve is horrible. However because of the fantastic help desk and fantastic phone response time and knowledgeable and very helpful help desk crew even I have been able to work through it.
This is my 6th kindle and for some unknown reason I cannot get the Wi-Fi to work so alas I cannot download any books.
Excellent device!  I recommend it to all!
I love it! I'm trying to get used to everything right now....mainly reading books from Amazon and checking email.
"So many new things.  I am a really bad typist, so talking to it is fabulous.  what a great tablet."
Worked right out of the box. Easy to use except for where did they hide the on/off button. Feels heavier and thicker than my previous Hdx Fire 7. I'd recommend this.
for the price it is a nice descent quality tablet
"Just love my Fire HD 7, it was a Mother's day gift. Can't thank my children enough for such a great gift."
So far  I am very  disappointed with my tablet.  I am mostly using  Word with Friends&#34; and I'm having a difficult time keeping the screen from going  BLUE in the process of  the play with others. I have to reboot the tablet several times each day to finish my Word play.  Is there any way to correct this or is this the way it is designed.?<br /><br />'
"Bought one of these off of QVC!  Froze up on the second day!!  Sent it back and got a replacement!  SAME THING!!!  Called QVC to  complain and they said the units were sent from AMAZON not their warehouse!!!  Will not buy a third!  Read the reviews on QVC and almost everyone who ordered this had the same problem!!  Was Amazon sending their rejects to QVC customers or what????  I have a Kindle Fire that I bought a couple of years ago and loved it until today when it froze up!!  Now, I have none!!!!"
Love it.
It's great only had a Kindle before.
"A fantastic tablet for the money, the screen quality is top notch."
Much nicer than original Kindel.  Hopefully the charging port won't ware out like the original.
Enjoy the ease of use. So glad I decided to purchase it.
Very disappointed with this device had it for 3 months before it started to giving me problems. Has to stay plugged in to work. I called tech support and they helped me trouble shoot and had to reset everything to factory that lasted 3 months and than same problems started back again. I have to keep my tablet plugged in order to work otherwise it shuts off. My daughter's is also doing<br />The same thing and since I didn't buy a warranty they will not replace. Don't waste your money with this tablet.
My mother loves it
I purchased this device for my wife.  She has always loved to read books but since she has had cataract problems she has stopped reading entirely.  After receiving her Fire HD she read 1 novel that night (she stayed up until it was finished) and read three other novels over that same week.  This was a great choice for her because she stays connected with her friends on Facebook and always used her very heavy Laptop (big screen because of her cataracts).  Now she can use the Fire HD and connect to her friends on Facebook. The only time she pulls out the laptop now is when she forgets that the Fire HD needs to be CHARGED once in a while.
Easy you use.enjoying it
Satisfied all required needs.  Easy to learn how to use.
I love it completely.  Its better than the straight kindle
I have 3 other Kindles and I have to get used to all the functions Fire offers but the clarity of the screen is great and I love the print font on the books.  It's more complicated that my keyboard Kindles and about half again as heavy and twice as thick so that is a concern but all in all for the price I think it's really good.
"I'm really enjoying the speed of my kindle and the picture quality for shows and movies is better than expected.(I have a first generation nook color and loved it for reading, but for internet browsing it was intolerably slow) One disappointment is the apps not available. And unless you root it you can't get apps elsewhere. My husband enjoys clash of clans and was expecting to be able to use his kindle for this but unfortunately amazon doesn't offer it. So he is very disappointed. So for me it's what I hoped for, him not so much."
"The best thing about my new kindle is the color. There are hardly any new features. Now that I think of it, none of them are worth mentioning. Seriously thinking of going with the iPad mini next time and that says a lot considering this is my 4th one."
I love my Kindle!  I am still learning all the great things I can do with it.
"The lack of Google apps is kind of annoying, given the fact that I've bought so heavily into the Android ecosystem on my phone.  You can sideload many Google Play-purchased apps, but some of them just don't work.<br /><br />As far as reading goes, it's a great platform.  Both PDF and Kindle books load and run great.  The only complaint I have is that the navigation of the library is confusing, with it constantly re-ordering my books based on how recently I read them.  Since I use several books as reference material, and I'm constantly switching back and forth between them, it makes finding a book in my list sometimes a bit challenging, because they're never in the same place twice."
It's picture is amazing and the price was pretty fare but I bought it for my son and I HATE the way the parental controls are set up. I might have to get an iPad and trade him.  :(
"I gave a Kindle Fire to my brother as a gift. However, Amazon will not let him authenticate it. If this is not corrected I will have to return it."
it came with hardly instructions.very frustrating
"the fire HD 7 can do a lot of things that I am not yet familiar with how to work, I love it, and the only problem<br />I have with it is that you cannot see the screen when outside if the sun is shining, And that was primarily<br />why I bought it, so I could play on it while outside.oh well."
"I have only had my new 4th Gen Kindle Fire HD 7 for a little less than a week but I couldn't be more happy. I like it just as much as my Samsung Galaxy  Tab 4 7&#34; Tablet. They are two different machines and each has it’s own characteristics but Amazon seems to have done a lot to make this tablet an easy to use beginner-friendly machine that will also satisfy the experienced tablet user as well.<br /><br />While waiting for my new Kindle Fire HD 7 I did a LOT of reading of reviews on both the tablet itself and the apps that interested me. What I found was that much of the information is for previous generation Kindle Fire HD’s and  is either outdated or irrelevant.<br /><br />A detailed review of a product like this could easily take up more space than is available here, so I will just touch on some of the highlights, with an eye towards updating some of the outdated review information that applies to older versions of the tablet.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Some Previous Issues Fixed<br /><br />  Includes Charger - The 4th Gen. Kindle Fire HD now comes with a 5W charger included in the box.<br /><br />  Power Button - Some reviews I read had complaints about the power button being too easily pressed accidentally.  On my unit the power button is small and located on top of  the unit making it next to impossible to turn off without specifically trying to do so.<br /><br />2) Screen - The screen is now made with Gorilla Glass. It is less prone to scratching and a lot more durable than the glass on many older units.<br /><br />3) Improvement In On-Board Apps<br /><br />  Email Client - Two of the biggest complaints about the email app on previous generation Fire Hd units was the lack of ability to do a bulk delete of items in both the Inbox and the Trash folder.  I am happy to report that both of these are now available out of the box. Long press the  title of any email and a check box appears before evey item in your Inbox. Select as many as you want and hitdelete in the drop down at the top of the screen. To empty your trash simply swipe from the left of the Inbox to reveal the sidebar. Tap on the word Folders, then Trash. Then tap More at the top right of the screen and the option to Empty Trash comes up. Tap it and confirm the delete.<br /><br />  Plays You Tube Videos Out of the box - No more need to sideload the Dolphin browser and Adobe Flash.<br /><br />  Camera App now easily accessible and appears in Favorites - It is no longer hidden and doesn't need to be referred to as the secret camera app any more.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />You are more or less moved toward a dependence on the Amazon ecosystem to get the most out of this device (unless you want to put in a lot of extra time and effort).<br /><br /> Lack of SD Card support - I got the 16 GB version of the tablet but the small amount of  on device  storage almost forces you to use cloud services, and  Amazon Cloud in particular as a default. This may not be a big deal in this day and age, but I still prefer to back thing  up to a physical medium over which I have ultimate access and control. Amazon has made this  process a lot easier than it was in the past, and you can certainly choose other Cloud based services, but Amazon talks about unlimited Cloud storage with this device - with some caveats.<br /><br />Unlimited Cloud Storage - Gets both a pro and con rating - The Unlimited Cloud storage applies only to Amazon content (apps, Kindle edition books music etc acquired through Amazon), documents created or edited on the tablet and photos taken with the device. Amazon does give you 5 GB of free storage for other media and documents, but that can get used up quickly in today’s digital age. Beyond those 5 gigs you will have to pay, but Amazon’s prices are quite competitive. As I mentioned a moment ago, the free unlimited Cloud storage also applies of photos taken with the device, which brings us to the next con - the camera.<br /><br />Camera - Picturestaken with the device are terrible. But the camera has a low MP count so you really shouldn't expect a  lot. The included photo app offers some limited editing ability, but to end up with even decent looking pictures you  are going  to have to transfer them to a computer with some serious editing software.<br /><br />If I have one main complaint it is with the lack of a printed, up to date user’s manual. Although there is a user guide on the tablet itself it is not readily accessible, and the beginner may have a hard time finding it. Also, having  to read a user guide on the device while trying to perform the task it is teaching you can be tricky at best.<br /><br />Searching the internet for  help will bring you a lot of results, but as I stated above, much of the information is for previous generation Kindle Fire HD’s and is either outdated or irrelevant due to the fact that Amazon has apparently been listening to criticisms and suggestions and made many of the necessary fixes.<br /><br />The Amazon App Store has it’s own set of pros and cons but that is the subject for another review.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a solid tablet for a reasonable price that beginners and experienced users can get up and running on in short order. If you don’t mind being largely locked into the Amazon ecosystem, or you have another tablet for a different platform then I personally feel that the Amazon  Kindle  Fire HD 7 is a great buy for the money.<br /><br />I would highly recommend you get one and find out for yourself."
"Seriously? You are forcing lock screen ads on a device I own? Forget about running a better ROM. They've made it so far impossible. I bought this for my mom but if I'd known how hard it is to navigate, the complete inability to run a custom ROM, and the ads being forced down the user's throat I'd have went with Samsung. Do not recommend."
"Nice price, excelent device"
Love it.
what I expected and more. Just love it. Everyone I've talked to said if you're considering a tablet get a kindle. I received this for mother's day and it is one if the best gifts I've ever gotten.
"I have never used a tablet before, and am still learning, but really like everything I have used so far. My granddaughter, age 10, loves tablets. and she likes this one better than any she has access too in the family! She has downloaded alot of games to play. I hope to download books, since I am visually impaired and miss reading greatly. I'm hoping to be able to read again using my Fire, a great birthday gift from my mom!!"
I have really enjoyed it.
"Very satisfied with the functionality so far, but I really wish I had an operations manual, or it came with an on-line tutorial.  I am still not sure how to navigate between applications or how to close one down.  I had several photo attachments in my email, and had looked at all of them before going to an area without network access.  Why could I access some of them but not others?<br /><br />Still learning what I can do with it."
love this tablet
"Last one lasted two years. Still works but won't hold a charge. Had to be plugged into outlet to use, which inconvenience for me.Other than that it was great."
love it
I have 2 kindles. the fire HD and the original one. These have been nothing but a problem after the first 6 months of owning them. I have tried to get the issues taken care of and only told oh well it wont happen again your kindle is all set. To only have the problems happen again again more frequently These are pushed on until the warranty is up and then nothing gets taken care of they just want you to buy another Kindle.<br />What my kindles do it I will be using them and it will have 92% battery it will just shut down. . When I turn it back on it says that there is 0% battery. I then have had to hard reboot my kindle so that it shows the battery amount as well as be able to use it. This is a horrible problem that they wont fix or take care.
"2 stars Doesn't work.<br /><br />Fri 5/22/2015 12:52 pm. It's 2 stars because there are so many gadgets around that do one thing and another, and this doesn't anything very good.<br /><br />1. I get a headache when I try to read in bed. 2. There's no way to save a bookmark in the built-in browser. 3. All the &#34;help&#34; I can find, much of it amazon-originated -- of course, using a *real* browser on a PC to search the web -- is obviously outdated, aka &#34;wrong&#34;. The help *on the Fire* is just as obviously outdated or just mentally-deranged..<br /><br />And oh yes, the battery life is nothing to write home about. Particularly compared to a &#34;real&#34; Kindle black & white screen.<br /><br />I didn't return it because it was a kind of experiment and I guess I kept thinking it *must* work better than this. But I admit, the complete absence of bookmarking, which makes the browser more completely useless than it is already, really surprises me.<br /><br />... But after writing this, I returned it."
In love!
Love it but I wish it stayed charged as long as my old kindle
"I absolutely love it. As a senior citizen who is not so proficient with the new technologies this more than meets my needs.  I love browsing websites, reading emails,etc.  It makes me feel in the loop of things."
Bought this for my college daughter. Not as fast a loading as it claims but still a good product.
Great product. Love it
Very good
Clear crisp video and sound is better than on my iPad. Great value as well.
"So far so good! I bought this for my Mom for this year's Mother's Day and she absolutely LOVES this Kindle Fire HD 7! I just wish she would stop telling all of her friends &#34;look what my son bought me&#34;, ughhh I hate that type of attention."
Nice tablet. 7&#34; is maybe a little a<br />small. Wish I went bigger
I love it it was a gift from my son
"Durable, perfect size to throw in my bag. A couple of glitches here and there, but nothing a restart doesn't fix. The quality of the video and the audio is great. Totally worth the money."
"Love these little tablets. I bought a HP computer with touchscreen and find it so frustrating I don't even want to turn it on. The 7&#34; tablet does 95% of what I need, quickly, easily and this newer one is even better with more compitant handling of pictures. I read on it all the time and surf and do social media. I don't want a phone in it and the size is handy with a big enough screen to have real pages with real font size."
Everything went well.I like my kindle fire very much.
satisfied
Great love it.
back up better than the other models
I'm still learning but so far I love it!
I love it. It's beautiful & the stand is great.
I love it
I waited a long time for this.  I am an avid reader and this is wonderful.
"This is my 4th purchase of a Fire and this one is the best. My grandson loves his, so does my husband and I love my new 7&#34; HD Fore I got for Mothers Day. It is lightweight and has so many new features. You can't go wrong with Fire."
"I like the idea of the Fire but in the end it just was not the best tablet for the price.  I dislike that many of my favorite apps are not available through the Amazon app store. Or worst, that some apps are only available for the Fire HD but not regular Fire. In the end, I prefer the Samsung Tab 4 that I bought to replace it. The android app marketplace is superior and, for no technical or highly informed reason, I just prefer the Android tablets."
This think is pretty cool i like it. The thing i dont like NOTHING LOL
Loving it!
The only feature missing is the light indicator letting you know it is charging and when charging is complete.  Other than that I love the Fire HD7.
I love it. It was a great upgrade from my basic kindle. Highly recommend it!
Very pleased with this tablet! Thanks
Awesome!
I bought this and the HDX 7 and I really love the 2 of them. I don't know why people complain about any of them. They are 2 good kindles I guess you can't keep everyone happy always complain and complain about something. Maybe you just don't know how to use them.
"Bought this for my aunt, who is 85, and simultaneously set her up for an Amazon account.  She is enjoying it very much!"
"The battery life is very short. After one month of ownership, today I noticed a cracking the screen!!!! I haven't dropped it or misused it in any way!<br />I should have saved the $100 and gotten another iPad! Not impressed!"
CAN NOTGET INTO GAMES.
"It has a very good screen and brightness.  Although, I have not been able to figure out some of the things it can do, I am enjoying the<br />FireHD 7."
Still learning.  Not as easy to operate as my Kindle keyboard
Response time is too erratic. Sometimes I barely touch the screen  and the screen reverts to something totally unexpected. Other times I have to depress icon and tap to get a response. Setup is confusing.  I try to stick to the games where there is less hassle.
"It is not a true tablet. It is a great reading device w some Apps. Some of my favorite apps are not available. My library uses Blio, not available. On Board Player for Southwest airlines, not available.<br />Facebook, available. Google Mail available.<br />Another and different charger. That makes 4, I need to carry.<br /><br />For the money it's a good gadget. Much cheaper than a mini iPad. Just know what you want to do on it. The Graphics are beautiful. The size is nice."
A great little device.  Love it.
Itwasverygood
"Basically a large phone or iPod. Works fine, but only gave it 4 stars because it runs out of storage quickly and takes forever to charge. Otherwise, it seems to be a good product."
The fire HD is very nice. It is doing all that I need. I am still learning the many things that can be done on it but so far I love it.
I Love it. It is all I expected it to be and more. I would recommend it to anyone.
"Wow! Great little computer. I have the first Kindle Fire and it worked ok, but the browser was terrible and crashed a lot. The new Fire HD has a great browser very easy to use and to add bookmarks. The prime videos run fantastic and crystal clear. Same for Netflix. The old Fire was always hanging and had to reboot. The Fire HD is smooth and has never hung up. The sound is fantastic and really High Fi.  I miss the charge light, but getting use to it.  The battery symbol shows number % of charge left, very nice. NOTE: Be sure to fully charge it when you first get it. The battery charge will last much longer. The little charger that came with it works nice. When I charged it with the USB port on my computer a note popped up that said the charge was weak and would take a long time. The HD Fire has great graphics and the op system has been smoothed out and works great.  I got the Fintie Fire HD 7 Tablet (2014 Oct Release) Case Slim Fit Leather Standing Protective Cover with Auto Sleep/Wake Feature (Amazon). I like it, very handy.  There is an app (gear wheel) that came with the Fire HD. This is the settings app where you customize the Fire to fit you. The HD Fire is a winner for Amazon..."
It's great
"This is my very first Kindle. Don't judge me, I'm behind the times! I'm an old school paper book girl, there is just something about the smell and a feel of a book. But when I was offered a change to get a kindle as a blogger to do book reviews I gave in. I will admit I have been very pleased with my Kindle! It is very easy on the eyes when reading plus I can put most of my phone apps on it too! Yaya for a bigger screen! I no longer have books everywhere and have to worry about storing them if i would like to read them again! I opted in for the Fire HD 7, 7&#34; HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, the ONLY thing I would do different is PAY to have the ads removed. other than that I like it...I like it A LOT!  It quick charges and has a great battery life!<br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."
ITs great.. hold s it charge better than the DEL VEnue!!!
"A Question. Can I use the Kindle fire to read outside like on the beach like I could a regular Kindle, like I can't do on an iPad?"
love it......
I love my kindle goes with me everywhere I go it's the best I wouldn't change it anything....I really do recommend it you wont regret it...
"This is a great tablet, We use it, and the rand kids love it too!<br />Very functional and easy to learn!"
"My first tablet.  Very fast,clear screen, very convenient, easy to use."
"Love, love, love my new Fire HD 7!"
I received my Fire HD 7 from my son for Mother's Day.  I was previously reading from my Android phone and IPod.  I love the Fire HD 7.  I can read my books as well as check Facebook and play games.  I recommend this product to any one that reads.
It was a gift for my mother and I have to admit that it's the best or one of the best tablets for the price.  Amazon unlimited photo storage it's great.  Got the 7&#34; with the $99 offer.
Awesome
Love it!!!!!
It's great. Too many game offers I don't play games. I'm guessing it's because my other three were for my grandchildren.
"I love to play games, read and check my e-mail when I'm waiting for Buses or Drs. appointments. Love it, love it, love it."
"I am beyond thrilled with my new Fire HD 7 tablet. It not only does everything I need a tablet to do, when you add in the Fire Stick, it does so much more! I travel a lot, and my biggest gripe is always having to drag my laptop. Now, I just put my tablet in my purse, and I'm good to go. It's small enough to fit in my handbag, yet big enough to work from. And it cost me next to nothing. I could not be happier with this product!"
"The Kindle fire is wonderful. I read on the train, I can check my emails, play games and, look at Facebook ."
The screen is not suitable to read books in the sunlight! I like my &#34;old&#34; kindle better for just reading.
"It's nice, but not being able to access the Google Play store  is kind of crippling.<br /><br />I just can't stomach the idea that I'll have to re-purchase my Android apps through the Amazon app store to use them.<br /><br />Its a shame really, because it's much snappier than my old Nexus 7."
am still getting to know my new device. I am liking it more and more.
Love my Kindle Fire!! It freezes up a little but  tech support is outstanding!!
"I've not been using this exclusively for my internet contacts ,but ,I am very happy with the functions ."
Great Device
I love this! This device is almost perfect does almost everything I need it to. The only draw back is you cannot customize the background and unless you pay extra you deal annoying advertisement!!! But other than that it's great!
Awesome
Great
I had high expectations and it did not meet them.  It is not as easy to use as the original Kindle.  The user guide doesn't help much in answering my questions or help me learn how to use it effectively.  I downloaded a game app and couldn't figure out how to use it.  Since I don't have a smart phone it was not intuitive. I was surprised I had to recharge it so quickly - daily.  The wifi feature to do searches won't be helpful when traveling as I had anticipated.
Easy to use for beginners
"Only complaint,wish it had a stronger receiver for WiFi. My other devices have no issues at the same distance."
perfect
Great
My 9 year old granddaughter loves it. She's on my account so potentially could have assess to all my content but you can set up a separate account and block whatever you want with your password.  I have one and use it every day. Love it!
The display is wonderful and I love the color.  My only complaint so far is that it runs the battery down very quickly.  Even if it's just sleeping and not being used the battery very quickly dwindles down.
"I was not impressed with this product. I already own several kindles and this one just didnt seem to be an upgrade. Its a really good price, just not the upgrade I was looking for."
"Most amazing tablet ever!!! It's worth every penny. I love the sound quality, it's better than my laptops. The processor is fast and great for multitasking. I can push my shows onto the t.v. without an HDMI cable. I am so happy I got this tablet over an iPad. So much cheaper and much more durable. I have dropped it 3 times today and nothing happens. Gorilla glass screen makes it so durable. I LOVE IT!!!! And the battery life is amazing! Beautiful visuals and great touch sensors for typing this review. This very light tablet is so amazing I'm buying one for my mom and boyfriend too!"
I love it
I love it! It was bought for me as a Mother's day present and I could not be happier!!
Love. It was a great replacement for the one i bought two years ago. Love how fast it is and the home screen.
"I've only had it for a couple of days... but so far, I'm loving it!"
Was everything I expected - and more.
"Daughter loves it especially the camera, definite improvement over her previous kindle."
"I recently bought a pink Fire HD for my daughter and a blue one for my son.  I had been looking for a tablet that they could access learning sites, such as RazKids and FirstInMath, as well as watch movies.  I love that the Fire HD can stream movie titles for free with our Prime Membership.  The kids also love playing video games and watching YouTube videos and Disney shows.  I downloaded books for my daughter and they also love taking pictures and videos of our new dog.  These tablets are a hit."
"I love my Kindle Fire.  It's everything I expected from Amazon.  It's the perfect size to fit in my purse.  Now I can listen to my books anywhere I am not able to read them.  Love, Love, Love my Kindle."
Love it!
I love my Fire!
This is better than I expected.
Great value for the money. Does exactly as expected.
I like the tablet and I've purchased it twice but some apps are slow to respond and some are not adaptable to kindle fire
I was disappointed that I couldn't get some of my play Store apps on it. Two major ones where Instagram and Meijer. I thought I would be able to get apps from the play Store also.
It is very nice still learning how to use it as I am older and never used a tablet before
I love it. It is great.
"Super fun and easy to use tablet.  I am disappointed with the battery life, however.  In the days of ever-growing technological feats, I was surprised at how quickly the battery ran down.  Purchased with the goal of using while traveling, I am bummed to think I will have to worry about charging it frequently.  Very user-friendly, and love the convenience of having so much at my fingertips.  Also love that I can download digital copies of my magazine subscriptions for free."
"Received my Fire as a surprise Mother's Day gift.  I love it! So many features and so convenient to catch up on reading,Facebook, or playing games while waiting for appointments. Plus, it takes great pics!😃"
"It is a nice tablet, however, I still do not know how to use some of the functions, i.e. camera.  Also do not know how to google on the internet.  Would like for tablet to come with instructions!!"
Seems like the battery discharges when the screen is off. Our other (non-amazon) tablet does not have this issue.
"I use my Kindle for everything. It is my calendar and my connection to social networking. Not to mention it saves me a ton of space, I no longer have books laying everywhere."
It is easy to navigate and I love the e-books that are available.
Excellent choice.<br />Very happy with service as well as model.
Love it!  similar to the earlier version so it is not hard to use.<br />Learning new features still.
It is great!
Enjoying my new kindle and all the features.
Love love love it.  So easy to use and much better than my old plain jane Kindle.  So much to do with it but so little time.
I like it - way more than I expected.
App selection is less than desirable.  Missing lots of games/features that Samsung or Apple would provide.  Will look for a droid tablet in the future with Google play capability.
"I love it, the back lighting let's me read anywhere."
I love my kindle! It offers so many options. And it's tough. It has to be with habit of dropping things. I can even watch movies if I want to. And the price is definitely a plus. Tablets with the same options cost much more.
"Having read that a local retailer had the Kindle Fire on sale as well as on Amazon, I headed out to the store to check it out. Turned out to be the smaller version so I jumped at the bargain on Amazon. Love being able to read my books on the go as well as surf the web. Great sound and picture quality. No complaints here."
"Decent hardware ruined by a bad OS. Just give us plain old compatible Android, not a proprietary hack."
Beautiful...great clarity. No issues with it at all.
Easy to use. Easy to read with...fantastic!
I dont leave home without it. I love it!
"I love my kindle fire. Its like my favorite new toy.  I am able to read pdf's I need to review for work, read books I am interested in and let my kids watch Netflix."
Best mother's day gift ever...met my expectations...
"I have the kindle from 2013,and  wanted a new one that could take pictures.Although the camera feature is nice I don't like not having a quick access favorites star, and the keyboard is slightly smaller"
Nice tablet for the price.
Pretty good for the price!
I love it!
"It's a wonderful device---has everything you need on it and easy to learn to use, even for an old timer like me.  It might take a little longer, but I figure it out!!"
"I love the Kindle but I wish the directions had been clearer.  Nowhere did it specifically say how to download a book.  In addition, I can't seem to pick the authors I want from Kindle Unlimited."
Wonderful
"Great so far, still getting use to it.  Finding it very easy to use."
"This is my third kindle purchase.  I have bought for an8 year old, 80 year old and myself.  My husband wants a new one as his is the first generation.  We are big readers and use our local libraries for downloads."
Received as a gift; love it!
I own three generations of fires that should be recommendation enough.<br />Great product!!!!
I think it is a great tablet
"Display is phenomenal, but disappointed by the battery life - feels like I'm recharging it every other day as compared to my iPad which lasts at least a good week or so."
"I an really enjoying this, but I am slightly disappointed in the apps available. Still not up to par with a regular android device, but a great little machine for the price of $79."
Love it
1 of the best ;)
i am well pleased with this item.  Would recommend it to anyone.
This tablet has met all my expectations. It has replaced my laptop in almost all my work.
I don't recall any special offers but the unit seems to work fine.  It's going to take a while for me to use it to it's potential.<br /><br />'
Haven't had the chance to fully explore all the possibilities yet!
Super great
I love it
"Great display, easy to use, wonderful camera!"
Great so far
Nice 😆 meets all needs & expectations immediately cancelled my nook subscriptions even download even re-downloaded a book or 2
Great reader. Love the apps and all I can do with it. Almost as good as my wife's I Pad
It is great. I am very glad I got it.
Everything I expected and wanted. So far so good @ 2weeks in
Not user friendly. It went back to QVC.
My little sister loves it!
Meets all my needs.  Enjoy playing games.  Takes nice pictures.
Great
Great buy  really enjoy it
I love it .
"Complete junk.  This tablet can not be customized.  The apps on the Amazon don't compare to the ones on the Google Play Store.  When you type \\""Google Play Store\\"" into.the Amazon Store search box it indicates there was a match.  It did this the first time I ran a search so that tells me that Amazon has this search term cached, but has no interest in actually providing access to the Google Play Store.  The ads on this tablet should never have been there in the first place.  I paid $15 to Amazon to remove the ads.  They claim that the ads are the only way they can subsidize the device.  Bulls***.  You can't tell me with a straight face that for a device that is almost $150 retail is really that much more affordable at $15 off.  Plain and simple, Amazon makes A LOT more money from the ad sponsors than they do at selling the 'no ads' package.  The button on this tablet is right next to the charge port which means that the charge port or the cable will become damaged more quickly from having fingers pushing the tiny button and putting stress on the port area.  Yeap, you guessed it.  More money Amazon can make off replacing damaged cables.  I could go on, but I think I made my point clearly: purchase any tablet that does NOT have some affiliation with Amazon.  I am glad this device was given to me.  Otherwise I would stop shopping with Amazon for anything, I might do so anyway after this fiasco."
"I bought this for my soon to be 13 year old daughter. She's loving it! I grabbed it when it was offered for $79, but paid the extra $15 that they charge to have no ads. I was a little disappointed that you have to pay to keep their advertising off your home screen, but given the fun she's having with it, it was still money well spent. So far, no problems."
"This was my third kindle fire. I keep going back to them, that should say it all!"
I love it! What more is there to say.  I can do everything I need without dragging my laptop around.
This tablet is awesome highly recommended
Perfect size for on-the-go...lightweight... fast Internet.  Images are bright and crisp.  Comes w/ Washington Post free for 6 months.  I got Amazon Prime and LOVE watching movies and shows on it.  I got it as an i-book reader so I can read on my work breaks and it's all I wanted and more.  LOVE it!
Just what I needed.  Great display.
I am so absolutely satisfied with my new HD Kindle and have been recommending it to everyone.
"Very nice gift for my wife.  I have a smaller and older model, this one is much nicer"
My little girl loves it she even prayed to thank god she got it and it was very sincere
Love it
"Works beautifully... I've bought fire's before as gifts, but this one is for me:-)"
"I am not completely satisfied with the picture quality provided with this tablet.  Also, I thought my case would put my Fire to sleep.  Can I return it and purchase a different case.  Perhaps some info regarding the camera quality would be helpful.  I'm not sure if I missed something in the details or if my camera isn't working properly."
"I purchased the 6&#34; and returned it immediately. It much too small.<br />The 7&#34; is bit thicker and heavier than my first Kindle Fire, but it a beautiful replacement. With sale, worth every $. Enjoy."
Very happy!
We bought 3 of these for out kids they love them !!
"It's not bad, but the display in subpar and I'd rather be able to use the Play Store as well. If you just want to access Amazon content, it seems good enough."
"I am still getting used to this. I loved my original Kindle,before I dropped and broke it. I don't know how to put my read books in an archive like my old kindle."
"I had high expectations, but my Samsung phone has more features :(  i'm returning this,"
exactly what the wife wanted!
Thus product seems to be great.  one problem I have lost my books from my other kindle.
Easy to use_having fun with it.
"Very impressed by this tablet. Awesome picture, quality sound, holds its charge for a long time. Can't think of anything I don't like about. I think for the price it's tough to compete with the Fire HD."
I am not a gifted electronic person. I do find that the Fire HD7 to be easy for me use. I did buy a book to give me assistance. I would reccomend this tablet to any other person who is not electronic gifted. The fire makes it easy to enjoy.
Great product from amazon. The kindle is great for reading or watching videos.
i don't like this thing. I
Really easy for my husband to see and use.
Easy to set up and ready for use.
"I haven't had my Fire HD 7 very long, so I'm still learning how to use it.  So far, though, I am enjoying it.  I have watched a few movies, and read a few books with it."
Love the graphics and the screen. Battery doesn't last if you have the screen to full brightness but not a major deal.
Great tablet
Great pics
"My kid loves it, I haven't had any technical issues either."
i like it very very much.
Love it it gives me everything I need
It has been a great little notebook that I have really enjoyed using.
Nice upgrade.
"I like it. I don't use it to its full potential, mainly just reading. I tend to forget all it can do and just use my smartphone."
having problems getting it to connect to wifi outside of my house.  works great at home just not on the go.
"A very nice entertainment vehicle. My only negative : it is quite heavy, esp. When one is reading for a long period. A cover with a stand does mostly solve that."
"So far, this device has surpassed my expectations.  I'm still  finding new features.  it's fantastic."
"I like most of the features and it is light years easier to use than the four or so other generic e-readers I've purchased in the past.  However, I was quite disappointed that the &#34;8GB&#34; machine only allows storage on about half that much, 600-700 megabytes are pre-loaded applications/operations and the rest of the GBs, WHO KNOWS!  And, of course, these machines don't allow for adding storage on SD cards.  I joined prime and thought I could download all sorts of music, but within a few days of perusing Prime music and downloading a variety of songs and playlists for my eclectic tastes, a very few simple games (mahjong, sudoku, solitaire) and a few books, I only had 10% room in storage for anything more.  Another words, 8GB.should read 5GB usable space for storing your games, videos, books, music, photos, etc.  What a bummer to have to start removing songs I had just downloaded to make room for other content..  I did not try photos or video content, but I shouldn't think I would not have had much room for them anyway.  The whole point for me is not to store things on my Cloud, but to have it available to me (I don't have an at-home internet connection).  I like variety to choose from in my games, books and music, depending on my mood and whether at home or on the go,  and this Fire HD does not quite give me the variety I need.  If you want a machine that focuses on books (which don't take much space), and just holds your favorite songs, pix and games of the moment,  then this Fire would probably be more than adequate for you,"
love it
"Lightweight, perfect for my 8 year old daughter!!"
I'd give it 4.5 stars only for the bright white spot that's sometimes visible on the screen. Other than that I can't complain at all. It is a nice piece of technology.
"love the kindle, battery life is pretty bad"
Had one of tge first Kindles but now that i have this one it is  prefect. Love it.
I love it!
it is a wonderful item I enjoy use it very much it is easy to use
"Best ever! My friends had kindles and I had junky tablets and I kept going throw them consistently so these are what I've gone throw. Didgiland, trio AXS 4g t mobile, alcatel one touch t mobile and now the fire hd 7 16gb this kindle was the best out of all! It's fast it has amazing sound, the camera is great, it's extremely durable, and the screen is big, and it's just amazing!"
I loved my other one the original so why would I not love this one it's faster pictures better I absolutely love it thumbs up
"Having owned a Fire HD6 for sometime, and thoroughly enjoying it, when the Fire HD 7 went on sale my wife thought I'd like it. She was right...with better sound (Dolby stereo) it makes all the difference when listening to music or watching movies, I am 100 % satisfied !"
"Works great, love the color"
Very happy
Best tablet for the whole family!
Great tablet for the price.  My daughter is really enjoying it.
Amazing good quality tablet. Love this thing!!!
I gave this kindle to my mother as a gift. She found it very user friendly and has enjoyed reading her books on it.
Awesome little device.  I use it extensively and never had an issue.  Only recommendation would be to buy a good case.  They are very sturdy but for me hard to hold in certain situations.  This one was a gift.
a
Does everything I need very well!
I am very pleased with the Fire HD cover.  It is very sturdy and should last a very long time.
Great product!  Easy and fast connections and a lot of apps to choose from.  I like the size and the clarity.  Also this product makes for easy amazon shopping from your couch.
Great tablet....I would recommend this one over the others!
My father loves it
great
Still learning but love the Kindle
"I was totally thrilled with having books, music, and movies at my fingertips, but feel totally spoiled with the Silk browser's speed and convenience! My poor laptop is getting dusty. It's my companion in the kitchen, playing music and displaying recipes. It was a  blessing to have during a day-long waiting room camp-out. The battery kept going all day as I read, played games, surfed the net, and kept myself from going as stir-crazy as my waiting room companions. It's fast, it's light, it's got a great display, pretty good sound and plenty of apps. The only drawback so far has been a bit of a lag on public library lending/reading apps, but I have enjoyed borrowing from the Kindle owner's lending library."
I am loving my new Fire HD 7!
Great kid friendly device
It's great. Love it. Can't put it down.
very satisfied!
Awesome!  Lots of reading and browsing going on!
I love it!  Gave it four stars because it seems the battery goes down very quickly...  besides that it's great!
this is one of the best tablet I have ever purchaseI have dropped it is fell drop in the street and it still working one of the best devices that ever purchase from Amazon
good
This is our 1st tablet and we are not tech savy. It took some help to get it connected to wifi and loading apps. It came with no instruction book. Still leaning it but do like it.
"Love the new kindle hd 7.  Easier to navigate.  The front and rear camera is a plus.  Was difficult taking photos prior to this kindle.  Video is awesome. Been watching Netflix with no problems.  I do wish it had port for the hdmi cable. Other than that, no complaints."
Awesome tablet for the money!
Very pleased!
This is an okay product. I do not like how little control you have over the images/promotional offers that appear on the screen. I also do not like that you can not add a password before purchases. My kids have been using it and &#34;purchases&#34; new games that pop up from adds.
"Love my Fire, it does everything I wanted."
It is far heavier than my first kindle but it holds a charge much longer.  Still learning all the features
Feels very durable.  I'm use to IPad so the system is taking some time to get used to. Works great but has some strange wifi connection issues. It will start to run slow and say 1mb download speed from router. Reconnect to router and it works fine.
On/off button is too flat and small compared to the older version I had and the device is a bit slower than my older version as well.
Love it. I had the second generation. This is much better. Its heavier though.
"Excellent tablet for the price. Has some functionality that my iPad mini does not, especially with Amazon Prime Video.  Love it for downloading shows to watch off line which you cannot do with iPad or Phone.  OS is kind of awkward compared to iOS on Apple products, that is the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars"
i love it. i waited a long time to ditch the paper books...this unit is great. inexpensive and easy to use. i wish i had purchased one last year. thank you Amazon!
Great expectations met!!!
"Great item, amazing price. Has worked flawlessly."
Love it. So much better than my old kindle fire
This is normal for me; I pray for religious content for review
"The tablet is nice but FireOS leaves a lot to be desired. No integration seamless with Google services, including Chrome, Gmail, Play store. Frustrating, as Amazon's apps are only adequate and the Amazon Appstore is hit or miss for good apps. Many are paid apps that don't deserve my money.<br /><br />Profile separation is a highlight as is the subscription to kids apps for a low monthly fee."
"Love, love, love!  Absolutely what I need it in my life.  I'm able to surf the web with no restrictions or read a book! I can't wait to explore more things to do with it, but for right I'm enjoying my device to the fullest."
"Love it.<br /> Excides my expectations, especially for this price point. Very clean display. Not a paper white, but I can read books in full sun light. Not a power user - just e-mail, books and web searches. Only concern is that battery seems to drain too quickly when watching videos. Otherwise, very happy."
"Was on sale for $99.99, so hard to beat at the price. Excellent color and graphics."
love it
Battery life is poor. Recharging takes forever
"So, I've had the tablet for while now and I do like it.  Great for reading books and equally useful for games and web browsing.  Haven't tried to watch any movies but the quality of the pictures as displayed on the tablet are quite good.  Battery life is nice and lasts for several days if just reading.  The  only thing I'm not 100% sure about yet is the screen interaction.  Works fine for games and web but when reading, it's a bit tricky to get the status (bottom display) and other tasks (top display) when a book is displayed.<br /><br />Oh . . . . and one other thing . . . the ads . . . HATE THE ADS!  Why do I have to see ads when I've already paid for the device and for the books!  Amazon really needs to look at this business model as it really takes away from the experience."
"Love the light weight and ease of portability of this powerful little beast , delighted I bought this as a second kindle for on the go . As much as I like my 8.9&#34; fire tablet I didn't find it as easy to tuck in my bag with the cover on it . Now I take my 7&#34; kindle with me without any issues of fitting into my smaller purses . Vibrant sharp colors burst from this tablet , I'd recommend it for anyone . Grandkids love it that I have it when I go to visit them ."
"For what this is, it is Wonderful- a full 5 stars- for what it is.  It is indeed just as fast and just as manageable as I had hoped.  This is my first experience with a tablet and I am not disappointed.  I cannot download my iTunes, but that is the only thing I needed.  I have all my radio stations, my Amazon Music, and I can sit with my wife in the livingroom and still see my email and FB and all my other things.  Totally recommend it- especially for younger users."
"LOVE IT!!!!! Fast & thin design. I also own the last regular Fire (7in) before they became HD & this one is a major upgrade. I'm really not a technology person.I don't download very much content & I'm not the type that's ALWAYS using my tablet. So I think this Fire is just as GREAT for people like me as it is for people who will use it to it's fullest capacity. It's much easier to personalize. It supports more sites & links. For example I couldn't see emojis, vines, or knitting articles on Right Relevance (I could only view the home page) on my old Fire BUT I now can see all of that on my new Fire. This Fire has it's own emojis accessible through the keyboard. Love that all my apps were ready to go on this one. No set up (because it was my second one). Love that the volume buttons are on the outside & seems to make for better volume control than swiping on the screen like on the old Fire.<br />So far the camera seems to be kinda &#34;so so&#34; but I'm 100% sure it's because I'm still learning. Other people on line seem to be good with the camera so I need to learn from them LOL!<br />So basically what I'm saying is, GET IT!"
Love it!!
"My mother who is 87 loves to read, said she wanted an tablet like everyone else in the family so I bought her the Fire HD. I've downloaded her favorite Bible and some study guides so the review is from her. Love it love it"
Exactly what I expected.
Awesome little reader/tablet. Beautiful display and such powerful speakers for such a small thing.
"Pleased, by far. Only drawback is that navigation is taking longer to learn than I'd like. Getting better, but I make sophomoric mistakes. The display is a plus."
Love this meets all the requirements anyone would need with out the price
A little bit hard to operate in the beginning. Totally different from the other kindles I've had. But love being able to read in the dark
Like it very much. Easy to use and I can even read in bright .  Only problem I've noticed is taht it gets very hot when I am playing some games.
Bought this to replace my old Kindel. Great picture and easy reading. The battery lasts quite a few hours without recharging.
"Fire HD 7 is a nice size to put in your bag and go ,yet larger than a smart phone  screen and  therefore  easier to see . The reason for only 4 stars is that the back cover ,I chose magenta , feels like  cheap plastic !"
I feel I made a wise choice and am not disappointed.  It has all the functions I was looking for.  I have the first E-reader that came out and the kindle fire.  I really love the camera function.  Couldn't pass up purchasing this item at a great price!!
Love our Kindles! Will never buy any other tablet!
I especially like the crisp clear images.
I have mastered reading a book and I have sent a few emails. Still trying to learn how to use my new Fire HD7Q. Have not taken a picture yet.
"I bought this for my daughter because I didn't want her using my nexus 7 anymore.  Don't let the 8gb storage fool you, a huge chunk of that is taken up by the OS.  I got the freetime unlimited which is nice, but needs a lot of work.  There needs to be a way to not allow her to see the apps I haven't downloaded.  She just downloads everything she sees and fills up the storage which then makes the WiFi shut off until you delete things.  Pretty frustrating for the both of us.  Battery life is kind of meh.  I got it at a great price but still underwhelmed with my purchase."
"Great as expected, this is my 3rd Kindle."
I love this tablet!!!  The graphics are amazing - I have Prime and the videos are crystal clear.  I love that you can download things and watch them later.  Web surfing is a breeze and reading my books is nothing short of awesome.  I'm so happy I bought this!!  I have no complaints.
"I love it, I have had a kindle fire for a few years it was time for an up grade. It works great and I love that I was able to pick my favorite color too!"
Very good
"So far so good, 3 rd one best yet"
"This is a terrific little tablet. This is my second Fire HD and the addition of a camera is a bonus, for sure. My only complaint and the reason I gave this only 4 stars is it came with a very short cord for the charger. It is only half the length of my initial Fire HD purchased in December 2013. Thank goodness I have another option."
Love it.  Works great.  I mostly use it to read books and watch movies.  Haven't tried anything else yet.  Wish it weighed a little less but it is lighter than my iPad so that works for me.  Very solid and great resolution.  Love the size.
I had a Kindle Fire which I loved until the charger wouldn't connect anymore and I couldn't charge the battery. I ended up buying a cheap tablet so I could play games but am so happy to have a new Kindle Fire.
"I'm having trouble with locked screen askin for pin number.  What is my pin number?  Instructions not clear, but I'm doing better.  Nice picture."
Great buy! Love the tablet!!!!!
I had no trouble getting this kindle fire hd it's works great
I will be returning this. It is my second fire and the setup is great. This one's sound cuts out periodically when watching video. It comes back after reboot but pretty annoying.
"Love my new Kindle! Great product, great price, just wish it had a longer battery life."
"My Fire HD 7 exceeds all my expectations! The delivery was quick, packaging was perfect. Out of the box, I was adding apps, music and videos. Plenty of storage and sleek professional appearance. This Amazon Fire HD 7 is a winner for sure! Side note: Applied for Amazon.com Rewards VISA at check out and received additional $60 bucks off. Sweet..."
"So far, so good. Although it does seem to lose its charge rather quickly."
This is my second Kindle. I love the updates. I love that it has a camera. It is faster than my older Kindle.
My most prized possession....meets ALL standards that I've come to expect from Amazon....this is my 3rd kindle....
I like so much better than the last one I had hands-down the best
It's nice I like it
"I have a bigger tablet and now I seem to just use this one instead, great price was the leading factor, everything I wanted and in a small size."
"This was a donation to a Chinese Auction to support Team Randy of Toms River, NJ.  As I did not win it :(, the lucky person who did seemed to be extremely happy they did."
"This is one of my favorite new toys and I'm glad I purchased it as my Christmas gift.  I mainly use it to read books and I must say I enjoy the fact that I can also play games and use the net on this device.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's a great buy!  Here is my list of pro and cons:<br /><br />PRO:<br />1. The price is awesome!  If you compare this to others you will find it's economical, yet still high quality.<br />2. I can organize and read my books now with a light in the background if I need to do so in the dark.  Not only that I can choose the size of the print and select different backgrounds.<br />3.  It takes great photo and videos.<br />4. Webpages download quickly and videos play just fine on Netflix (just download the app) and youtube.<br />5.  The size is great.  It fits right in my purse, yet it's big enough to see movies, etc. clearly.<br />6. I check out a ton of library books on this device; also if you load kindle books from price low to high, you will find loads for free!  Also, it's almost always cheaper to buy books for kindle than otherwise  . . . did I also mention I no longer need a book shelf.<br /><br />CON:<br />1.  The battery life only lasts for a few hours, especially if you are using the internet or playing a game.  It lasts longer when just reading.<br />2.  I run out of space quickly if I'm recording videos, however if I'm connected to the internet it downloads them to the cloud for free automatically.<br />3.  It's a little heavy if you are holding it for a long time, but I purchased a cover that can prop it up while I read.<br /><br />Overall this was worth getting!  I would buy it all over again without a thought!"
"My only issue is that I have to purchase a separate VPN network. Otherwise, it's perfectly fine as our ancillary tablet: the size is perfect for carrying around and the available apps cover all my needs in a tablet."
Very happy so far
Worth every penny!!!
"So far it seems to function fine.  However, I thought I was buying an 8G device.  The device displays about 5.06G, and when I called tech support they tell me, had I read the specifications it would tell me only 4.5 G were available for the user.  They were never able to show me the 8G of storage, and I feel defrauded."
Very happy with this tablet.  Very user friendly.
I'm very happy with my new Fire HD. It was very easy to start up.
"I got this Kindle Fire as a second one for my own use. OK, I will admit that I'm a big fan of Amazon's Kindle world. And when they dropped $60 off the price of this one for a special, I couldn't resist. I use each of my 2 Kindle Fire's for different purposes, but I use them both daily. I love the dual cameras on this one. Since I write articles about vegan cooking and backyard gardening, this Fire is perfect to take pictures, edit them, and save them on my Cloud for use in an article later.<br /><br />Frankly, that photo editor is simple and ideal for my uses. But, that's not the only reason I love Amazon's Kindle world. They have me hooked with how easy it is to use my tablets, loading everything I like to use from my Cloud. The 7 inch screen size is just right for reading and the screen resolution is beautiful, even for my aging eyes.<br /><br />Um, let's see what I can find negative about it. Well, the charging cord is a little short. But the battery charge is plenty for my use. I've never yet run it down to even 10% left. Maybe that's not such a negative for my anyway. End result: I'm very happy with the purchase of my 2nd Kindle Fire."
Super Great
The Fire HD has met and exceeded all expectations! I love it!
"I bought this for my mother.  She is pleased with it.  I would like to know if this fire hd is 2013 or 2014 edition, so I can buy the correct case/cover for it.  So far, I have been unsuccessful at finding how to contact customer service."
"It's good for books, games, and for a basic tablet. I use it more than I use my smartphone now. 😃"
This Kindle has a beautiful picture.
I bought for my son. He enjoys all the free apps he can use from Amazon. The screen size is quite nice. It was a reasonable price for the 16GB Kindle.
"Great Product at an extremely low price.  The screen resolution is great and the device is very responsive.  I got this for my wife who basically likes to use it for e-mail, Facebook and playing Facebook games.  Two of the games she likes to play are &#34;Candy Crush Soda&#34; and &#34;Alpha Betty&#34;.  Unfortunately, neither of these games are available on the Kindle store site.  Fortunately they are available as &#34;APK&#34; files which I downloaded onto her Kindle and installed with an installer program and then linked to Facebook. She is now extremely happy.  She can now play these games on the Kindle, her iPhone and laptop and they are all synced.  It would be nice if these programs were available on the kindle store site itself."
"Replaced my old kindle after its useful life expired with the Fire 7 to see how an inexpensive tablet would suit me.  Still learning to use it for fantasy baseball.  As a reader, I don't mind the extra size and increased weight(which is minimal) .  I am enjoying using it and perhaps this size tablet is just what satisfies my needs."
Very quick.  A lot of fun.  The speakers have excellent sound (for their size).
"I love this Kindle. Upset at myself for waiting so long to give Kindle a try.<br />I've always been a Samsung Tablet person, but kept hearing great things about the kindle fire.<br />And after seeing the commercials over and over again on this fire tablet, I finally gave in.<br />I am very impressed with this kindle, it is night and day different better then my tablet.<br />The picture is more vibrant. Colors are way better. It is even faster.<br />Then when it comes to reading Kindle books or shopping on amazon. It is way easier,<br />and flows better. Then using and app on my tablet. Guess that should be expected since<br />the kindle is the real deal after all, lol. Anyways I could go on and on about why I love my kindle,<br />but best thing for you to do, is purchase one yourself and see the difference."
It's great I love it.
For $100 I thought this was a great deal.  Much better than my ipad Mini but I bought it so I could stream movies on my TV and this Kindle fire does NOT have a HDMI port like the full size Kindle Fire.  Therefore its just an extra tablet that we are not using since I have 2 ipads and my husband has the full size Fire.  Why didn't they put a HDMI port on this????????
"Had the old black and white Kindle with the keyboard, until it died recently. Luckily it was in time for my birthday and I got this one. Love It! Wish the battery lasted longer but can't complain."
"Great small tablet.  Easy to use, and the price can't be beat.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small versatile tablet for use by the whole family."
Works great so far!
"Should upgrade to at least the 16 GB. Isn't a game playing tablet, use it for books and any word doc apps now."
"There are two games that I cannot get on the Kindle Fire that I really enjoy playing. Papa Pear Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga, please make it so I can get those games. Other than that I like it."
I am very pleased with the Fire HD
"Great tablet, and you can't beat the price! All 3 of my kids (ages 6, 8, and 10) have their own kindle fires and they love them!"
It is everything I expected it to be.
Super impressed with this small machine.
"It is good, a replacement for another model that died on me.  So far my only issue is that it doesn't alway switch from portrait to landscape view.  I have to flip it a couple of times, and sometimes shake it a bit to get it to flip."
very good
as expected
Love it!
"Compact but needs case to handle, lack of user guide makes it difficult to get started.,"
This is the 4th one I have bought and I am very pleased with each one of them.
"It's okay....I like the kindle fire better, it's easier to maneuver around...."
I have not spent much time with the new HD7 (I accidentally dropped my previous 7&#34;in my bathtub). I'm looking forward to figuring how to get the apps ands information match my 8.9&#34; tablet and ordering a few accessories.
Love it. But how can I sinc this to my TV?99
Great value for the price.
"I will never, ever, ever buy another kindle ever again.  If I want to download a game that Amazon doesn't get $$ for, I'm blocked from it. If I want to watch videos on YouTube, I'm blocked. Never, ever again will I buy this p.o.s."
Fabooo
"was sent the wrong color, other than that really enjoying it."
"love it, lighter than my older one"
Really  haven't  had a food chance  to do alot on it. But so far i like it.
Loved this book reading sequels
"First Kindle Fire, I had 13months.  Then got the BLUE screen.  Amazon (tech. support) said for $50 to $500 they could fix it. Instead  I got   a new Kindle Fire.  I have had 7 days,  and now it to has the infamous BLUE screen, and only after (7days) !  There appears to be huge problem with the Kindles weather a design flaw or a hack.  I'm sending this one back and will not purchase another one   So truly disappointed, I will try to find another type of note pad. My first review was good, but after a week  and a lot of time invested ( I'm not that much of a compute person )  then a blue screen, this is not acceptable."
Great😊 my third kindle l read all the time .easy to carry.my page is always marked
"Despite the BS Amazon TV commercials that say it is tough, it has a VERY fragile screen.  After three weeks, it was knocked off of the bed and the screen shattered leaving glass shards all over.<br /><br />Be sure to buy accident insurance."
I love my kindle but I'm trying to make a payment but I can't find where to go or how to call please help me out.
"Have not had a lot of time with the fire, but the few functions I have done have been great! Just wanted to upgrade when my basic kindle broke and I think Iade a good choice. The screen is bright and clear. Aps move quickly and 5he color is brilliant. No complaints!"
"I had an original Kindle Fire and felt I needed an upgrade.  Overall, I really like the Fire.  The reason for the low review is the battery.  It drains ridiculously fast.  After I purchased this Fire, I read past reviews.  They had similar complaints.  If I keep it in airplane mode and not connect it to WiFi, I can get 3 nights of reading (2 hours a night) out of it.  It then has to be charged.  Had I known how bad the battery is, I honestly don't think I would have purchased it."
Great selection of channels allows me to customize my programming and save MONEY over dish network.
So far so good.....I had an older kindle fire which was one of the first ones put out.  I loved it and it has served me well.  I am still getting used to the new layout with this one but so far love all that it has provided.  Time will tell as I have only had it about a week.
Love it! Works great. Easy to take on the go.
I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 7 for two of my youngest grandchildren to use to play games and to view movies. It is currently serving that purpose. The grandchildren love to use the Kindle.
Pretty good for reading and Netflix. REALLY don't like how the lock screen has ads. Don't like how you can't get a lot of apps for it. Also not as functional and intuitive as the iPad.
"I got this for my husband who has never had anything like this before.  He has a computer but everything is &#34;tied together&#34; as a family possession, and he also loses interest far too quickly when something is no longer challenging.  I have an iPad but he doesn't care for the IOS operating system so I have been trying to get him something that is exclusively his, with no dependency on other accounts or devices.  Knowing how hard it is to find something that he likes, I have been waiting to find a great price (just in case he doesn't like it).  I just so happened to log onto Amazon's &#34;Deal of the Day&#34; site at the right time and found Kindles' at a fantastic price that I felt I couldn't pass up.  I honestly have to say that I NEVER expected what happened next.<br /><br />1.  Amazon shipped the Kindle far earlier than scheduled so it was a pleasant surprise for him.  (Although he would never admit it, I know he was counting down the days until it was supposed to be delivered.  After all, aren't we are all kind of a kid when we are expecting a &#34;new toy&#34; in the mail?)<br /><br />2.  The setup was incredibly simple. By the time I got home he had already had it registered, installed games, apps and downloaded audio books.  (I wish I would have gotten the 16GB version because he downloaded the entire Bible in audio and ran out of room.  I've got to say that I didn't see that coming.  He is manic Bi-Polar so it is genuinely difficult for him to be truly happy or grateful so that gesture spoke volumes.)<br /><br />3.  I had barely made it in the door and up six stairs before he belted out &#34;I love this thing!  This is the best thing that I ever had!&#34;  Mind you, he's had bigger gifts but this gift was special because it was exclusively his.  He had his own device, setup his own account, personalized it the way he wanted it to be, the price was lower than he could have hoped for and it wasn't a generic piece of junk.  (After all, Kindle's are widely recognized as quality devices.)<br /><br />I am amazed, he still hasn't gotten bored with it yet.  He may consider it to be the &#34;best thing he has ever gotten&#34;, but I consider it one of the best things I have ever purchased.  If all &#34;Deal of the Day&#34; offers were as great as this one, most all of us would embrace our &#34;inner child&#34; a lot more."
very pleased
"GREAT, 1st tablet.  I'm not sure why I waited so long to get one."
Great!
Love my fire hd can get a lot with the prime membership
Very easy to use and makes books easier to read
Only one negative . I cannot access an important PDF file on this device<br />.
Failed catastrophically within 1 week of purchase
My wife loved it
"This is a great product.  It was purchased for my 14 year old grandson's birthday gift, and to quote his mom &#34;He loves it more than life itself!&#34;.  He played with it non-stop through his birthday weekend, and never leaves the house without it.  It gave him a freedom from borrowing his mom and<br />dad's entertainment devices at a really reasonable cost.  This made a great gift, the perfect choice!"
"Disappointed overall, stops or hangs up frequently.  Don't know how to briefly describe the problem last night while filming grand-daughter's graduation.  It hung up on a book (???) I'm reading- I missed an important part of the ceremony!  My 1st Kindle performed beautifully, this one is a disappointment.  Please have a FRIENDLY female tech contact me.  Thanks!"
"Great divice, exceeded expectations."
All in all it's a nice tablet.  Reasonably easy to use.  I've never had a tablet before but the transition to using it has been relatively painless.  I'm not too sure how to access an instructional booklet online.  The main thing I'd like to learn how to do would be to remove bookmarks.  I've got a couple that I'd like to get rid of but haven't been able to do so.  Other than that it's quick to start and most of the things are categorized well so you're not looking around a lot.  Battery life is pretty good but I haven't done much streaming.  Happy to have received it as a gift.
"I bought this device for my kid a while back.  Amazon thinks it's for me, so I constantly get updates and recommendations for games she has downloaded.  Because Amazon put their own face over the android operating system, you have NO option to use this device as you please.  Play in amazon's sandbox, or you cannot use it.  Getting adds on something I paid for reminds me of the old model of how cable television was.  I got rid of that ages ago, and now I will be getting rid of this thing."
Love the Fire HS 7. Easy to use and maneuver around
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY KINDLE FIRE HD!!!
I love it!!!!! This is my 4th Kindle and I use them all!! I sometimes hook this one up to our large screen TV (via HDMI) and am very excited that it works so well. Thanks Amazon!
"I have no complaints about the video quality or Prime, and I loved both my original Kindle Fires because I could run Firefox on them instead of the worst browser ever, Silk, that was included on it.  I had all my books on them, now I have to manually add all those to my HD 7's, fantastic I'll just click 700+ books, for the next couple of weeks, which by the way, is worse than my previous Kindle Fire because it keeps not downlaoding them lickety-split like the old ones, and thanks to their browser and infuriating &#34;block all outside apps app manager that gives you three rotten choices all leading back to the Kindle appstore, I have an electronic paperweight.  Amazon's policy of blocking Google anyway it can sucks, you two don't like each other, it doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to access their app-store. My next tablet won't be a Kindle Fire.  Who is Amazon to dictate where I can go on the internet on a device I paid the full no ads price for?  I have no complaints about the video or audio  quality, Prime, or anything else I've ever gotten, Amazon should rethink their &#34;company store&#34; mentality that drives this hold a consumer hostage culture..."
"I really like the new Fire HD 7.  The color was not my first choice, but the others would have taken too long to ship."
"Yes I am very please with my Fire HD 7, everything is great about it. The only think who is disappointing is the alarm ring, even with the volume on high it still to low.<br />Robert."
Great product.
IT IS A LITTLE SLOW TO BOOT UP.  ALSO I FIND IT RATHER HEAVY WHICH MAKES IT KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE FOR READING BOOKS.
"I have several issues with this product:  I was told that this product would hold a charge longer than my older kindle.  Well, this product can be charged up to 100% and by the next day, it has lost half its charge!  I am very disappointed with this.  Also, maybe it's due to my capabilities or understanding, however I cannot get a font that is bigger than a 3 on their scale.  I was able to do this with my older kindle.  Unless, you can assist me with these issues, I am ready to return it to you.<br />Thank you."
It is functional but dissapointing product. It is not the same quality  of.my other Kindle fire. The fire.wire charge  port just doesn't connect securely and battery life is short.  The video is nothing.to.rave about.
Arrived timely and I love it!
"I L-O-V-E my newfangled gadget!  Got this for Mother's Day, from my Beautiful daughter and Handsome son-in-law!  Best gift ever!<br />Now I can watch Netflix with my bluetooth headphones and not disturb a sole.  I can go into another room, (or outside) to Skype!<br />Just the best thing since sliced bread."
"I got it for less than a $85 from Amazon, and couldn't be happier. High value, when it comes to bang for the buck. However, don't expect an iPad or you will be disappointed. But let's be realistic, for the money, it has a great picture, the sound quality is good, and it does have some nice little tricks (although some unnecessary)."
"Love it, don't know what I existed before this Kindle. Highly recommend it."
I don't like the fact that I can't choose my own lock screen. It's annoying to see adds. I also wish that I had gotten one with more space but other than that I love it.
Was great while it worked. It wouldn't turn on after only 11 days !
Love it!
"Just a short review. Our iPad 1st gen finally got to the point where not many apps worked on it anymore. We decided on a Kindle Fire 7 as a replacement and my wife loves it! I would say I love it but I have used it maybe twice, in the middle of the night when I snuck it out from under her pillow. I had to sneak it to the bathroom, lock the door and see what the fuss was about and why she wouldn't let it out of her site. It is a well made easy to use tablet and I will take her word for it that is is awesome!"
Perfect
"Owned previous Kindle,loved it.  New fire is lighter, seems faster and has better display with front and rear camera. I love my kindles."
"I liked last year's design more, but this is still a solid device. My daughter loves to use hers."
this is my third Kindle..Have always been pleased with performance
"Perfect, great tablet. Ads are a pain, but the price was right so a necessary evil"
"I love it!!  I have a Kindle Fire which I also enjoy, but I especially like that the Fire HD 7 has a camera."
"Love it, now daughter wants one."
works excellent! really great for what I need it for this will make a great gift for first time tablet user :)
"I purchased for my granddaughter and she loves it. Easy to set up and when I had questions, the customer service rep was wonderful."
Love my kindle!!! Would highly recommend.
"I upgraded from a first Gen Kindle Fire with this and this one is a huge upgrade from that.  Games run better, reading is easier because of the weight difference, Netflix and Hulu look great compared to my last one, even the sound is better.  The cameras are not that great but you really do not buy a kindle for the camera, I have a Windows phone which takes excellent photos so really the cameras are just an extra.<br /><br />I mainly use my kindle to read and occasionally watch shows on.  Lately I have used it more and more to surf the web my poor PC just collects dust anymore.  I am very satisfied with this product could not be happier."
"Works well, good battery life, better than my android 7, no problems. I now use it more because of the book reading ability, and it's lighter, boots faster and I just like it."
"I'm loving it. Previously just had the kindle app on my Samsung phone. The kindle has bigger screen, brighter colors and has been easy to use. makes reading enjoyable. have watched a couple of shows on it, loved it. couple of games I downloaded have been fun. I'm really going to enjoy this purchase. good decision on my part. :-)"
Great tablet for my kids at good price!!!
Absolutely LOVE my Kindle Fire!  No problems with it at all!
Exceeds expectations!  I don't get much sleep these days because I'm up all night reading...
"So far, so good.  The HD picture quality is beautiful.  Have given my original Kindle to grandson and he is thrilled also."
"If you chose to buy a ire tablet, please be aware that the Google play store and some Google service will not work (Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Hangouts). If that is not important to you, then this is a great tablet."
Can't say I was overly impressed with the fire I had trouble with it freezing up alot
Love it since I never had a tablet before. Got it for $99.00. I see it's $139.00 now. Very fast & good quality images. Sounds good for something so small. Convenient to carry around anywhere in the house. Always used a desktop PC. Kind of wish I had gotten a larger screen size tablet. I love it for listening to my prime music in my workout room. But now I have to watch my bandwidth usage. Music & video really eats it up.
Nice compact easy to use
So happy with my new Kindle Fire!! Love the bright screen
I had a nook for years and didn't like it. This kindle has many great features! I'd highly recommend it!
"I like to think of a kindle as reading material--like a book and I am very disappointed to find that special offers are ads! We may as well be watching television.  Advertising is taking over all aspects of electronic life. At least with television, public television and one's own DVD collection have no ads. But if we are ever to replace ordinary books with a kindle, we must first start with eradicating advertising each time we open the device! I guess we should just stay with our printed non-electronic books!"
no battery life. dead in 2 hrs while playing solitaire.
very handy
Wish I'd have gotten more than I did while on sale
Love it
Love it!!
So far it is working good. Not sure about the battery lasting for long.
"Perfect tablet for us and the kids, for the price you cant beat it"
The power plug needs redesigning. Something more friendly to the user.
"It lives up to Amazon's high expectations for electronics ... I wish it had room for more memory and Skype capabilities, but my mom is a missionary so it fits her needs when downloading movies/tv shows and watching them on long flights and in other countries ... camera is awesome too!"
Nice speakers. Clear picture. So far so good!
The only thing I don't like are the ads when you first turn it on but not a huge problem.
Works great
I love my new Kindle - lightweight and easy to use!
The fire HD is not as easy to operate as I had hoped.
Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!
Amazon continues to amaze with the Fire Tablet. The color display and easy to use features equals fun for everybody.
"I've o only had this for a week, but I absolutely love it! I bought it for grad school to use for my textbooks mostly while it was on sale for $99, and so far I'm very pleased. I would recommend the fire hd 7 to anyone looking for a tablet and ereader all in one. :) Great product, great price."
I bought this Kindle for my granddaughter for her birthday.  She was very happy that it was pink A color that she loves.  She figured out the camera very quick and was taking pictures of everybody.  It is working up to everything that is expected of it to do.  I am very pleased
Perfect
"My sweet and beautiful wife got this for me as a gift, it is my first tablet, I am still learning all it is capable of,  but so far it has been an awesome, I am really pleased."
I've had the Fire HD 7 for about two weeks. So far I find it to be a very handy electronic device.  It was easy set up and navigation is simple.  I've used it for music and movies and game and email.  Thanks to Prime membership and the Fire I have access to a multitude of entertainment.  The Prime membership is very much worth the annual fee at our house.  Very pleased with both Fire and Prime!
"The price is good, but it doesn't support Chromecast, very disappointing to me."
Love it
excellent for the price!!!!
Its greaaat
Great alternative to the iPad with a much lower price tag!
"The touch screen is not very sensitive.  The functions are not very intuitive, and opening screens always open to ads. I had really hoped the music feature would give itunes a run, but it does not appear to have much functionality.  So, it is okay.  It's cheap."
"so far so good,this is my 6 kindle,I have loved them from the start.still use #5 to read during the day even though it was not in color,or HD, or camera etc... but it did come w WiFi and 3g for FREE sometimes you just got to love  a classic. I am noticing that because it only works with  WiFi I cannot really do much if I am not in a wi-fi zone.the color is nice and having the backlight is great for reading  a lot in the dark(insomnia) the battery does dies faster than my other one. I did order a nice bundle package  so if I am not reading I can charge it in home /car.having trouble getting audible app to download and order a game for my toddler and it ended up on my phone instead.if you own one of the previous version  than this is a nice upgrade."
"There is a lot of distraction, but it is a nice read, especially at night because I do not need any ambient lighting. I am having some difficulty with changing my settings, but I suppose I will get the hang of it before long.<br /><br />Very happy there is no phone on this device! However, accessing social media is pretty easy and I may eventually become accustomed to all the bells and whistles on this gizmo.<br /><br />I just wanted to read and carry my library around with ease."
"This is my second Fire, but this one is the best one."
Item was as described
Great tab no problems with it
I am a 1st time Fire HD 7 user. I thought the screen was a great size. And  kindle made its Fire HD easy to use. I have had a 7&#34; droid tablet . But the kindle Fire I think is easy-to-use then the droid tablet.
Love it!  A bit heavier than the regular kindle I'm use to but very nice
Works great
Love my kindle fire!!!!!
Exelent tablet. .
Was not as big as I thout
"Giving the Kindle Fire a 4 star rating due to limitation on apps (outside of root and side load). Allow Google apps and this would be a gem, till then 4 stars. Wishing I would of went with the Samsung Galaxy for another $40 now because of this."
I love this device. It is so easy to use and am recommending it to friends. The only disappointment is the lack of battery life.
"Battery life is not comparable to iPads, which is the other tablet I use in class. Won't even last a full day on idle. I suppose you get what you pay for, but it just isn't a quality product. I would not buy again even for $99."
Great
Works well and is much more than a Kindle reader.  Good battery life.
Works great.  Just have to learn how to use all the neat things that it can do.  I am not as thrilled with the cover that I bought as I am with the Kindle Fire.
I love it
It is great
So far I really like my Kindle Fire HD 7. I am having problems downloading the user guide to my computer though. I like to look at the guide while I am learning the features of the Kindle.  I am very new to the tablet.
"Love so far!  This is just what I wanted to use in my chair while my husband watches programs that I don't like on TV.  I use the computer a lot, but didn't like to be in another room from my husband at night, so this is perfect.  He has his ipad while he watches TV, now I have my Fire HD7.  I didn't need something as powerful as the ipad (husband also uses this for business) because I have a very nice desktop computer.  As I said, it is perfect for my needs.  I use this to check email, facebook, order items online, play games, or watch movies.  I continue to use my Kindle paperwhite for reading because it is easier on my eyes.  The fire screen is shiny and brighter, but also the pictures are so clear and pretty.  I don't think I could use this outside like I can the paperwhite. The picture quality, as far as I can tell with limited use, is just okay."
"My Nexus 7 died and my new Fire HD more than fills the Bill, it is fast, doesn't freeze up and works well with social media and email. Great tablet and gets the job done."
These are GREAT products. 2nd one.
"I really like it...I'm still exploring the options, but I am very satisfied.."
"Great tablet, especially when you get Kindle Prime."
"This is my first Kindle purchase and the first &#34;tablet&#34; like item I've purchased, so I can't compare it to older versions or ipads, etc. There are a few things that frustrate me. I'm used to being able to turn my smart phone on by tapping the screen. I can't do that with the Kindle fire. Maybe I'll get past this as I've only had it for a few weeks, but for now it's annoying and inconvenient. Navigating around the Kindle Fire is also a source of frustration. When my son is looking at a book on Freetime, or I'm playing a game, it takes some work tapping on the screen, to get the navigation options to come up. Sometimes as I'm tapping , trying to get the navigation options to display, it scrolls through several pages of a book I'm reading before I can get back to the home screen. This messes up the location that Kindle stores as my past read page. I wish the books my son downloads through freetime would be stored on Cloud, but it could be an App problem. I'd also like to be able to see a list of the books he's downloaded, rather than having to scroll through all of the available books hoping to find them so I can remove them from the device. This is mostly because of such little store space on the device. Also, they kind of trick people with the &#34;free offers&#34;. They're actually annoying ads that slow down apps and show up when you turn it on. I should have known when there was nothing about what the free offers are in the description. It's worth it to get the 16GB, as half of the 8GB is already used up at purchase. I think this will be a good starter item, but as anything other than a reader, it's painful to use."
Awesome. Love it but my next one will be with the 4G because I have found that I like to use it so much but am limited to only when I have a wifi connection:).
"It is an excellent tablet. The hardware is truly amazing but, the software not so much. There are many, and I do mean many, apps that are not available for the kindle and this are well known apps like Candy Crush soda or Boom Beach. I dont know why Amazon wont step up and give us what we want. This is an Android base tablet and it should not be this hard to get good apps, I mean most of the apps missing are available on tablets that cost 1/3 of the Kindle's price and are made by knock off Chinese companies.  If Amazon was willing to give us the new apps, in a timely manner, this would definitely be a 5 star+ tablet. Until then it is just okay."
The screen quality is outstanding and nice size screen. The sound is great. Good battery life.  Had a couple of issues at the beginning and after speaking with the technical department and walking through the steps everything turned out ok.  Nice tablet for first time users such as I.  Love the primer user benefit to watch free movies.
Amazon service is great. Kindle is great tool
"Purchased 3 of them for Christmas, they are a perfect gift!"
Great tablet for the price
Love it
Excellent
I can't stand all of the constant ads.  My old Kindle was much nicer.
Love kindle hd fire 7. Replacing slower older fire
"I am surprised at how quickly it sucks the juice.  I am always charging the thing.  Other than that, I am happy with this Kindle Fire."
Good for the price but no documentation explaining operations and setting up.
"Pictures aren't as clear as they should be. Overall, I like it"
"Perfect multi use tablet.  Was perfect on vacation, especially while waiting at the airport, with use both online and offline.  Seven year old is enamored with Kindle Free time abilities and the Fire is incredibly durable lasting through a cross country trip."
I was pleased with the whole deal from order to delivery
"I am liking the new Fire HD 7 Kindle that I have received.  It takes a while to get used to it after having used my Paperwhite for quite a while.  It is a bit heavier, so not quite so easy to hold in bed while I read, but it'll do.  The screen is beautiful.  I haven't figured out how to make it landscape instead of portrait, but it will come to me.  It can act as a tablet, and I'm happy for that.  Haven't really gotten used to that yet.  I guess it takes a while when you aren't a &#34;kid&#34; any more.  :)"
"I was hoping that this would be able to replace my Nexus 7 with this, but I don't think it is just in the cards.  If it had GPS, I could live with the other drawbacks (namely the lack of some Google products).<br /><br />The good:  Audio is better than on my 2012 Nexus 7, the Silk web browser runs circles around Chrome on Android, and uninstalling apps is more logical than how Google Play Store/Service does, IMO.  The Kindle book app isn't as glitchy as on the Nexus 7<br /><br />The bad:  Display isn't as good (no biggie, but still...), the curated apps don't seem to have been updated in ages, the camera could be better (but the Nexus lacks the rear, so this is a push), and the phyiscal dimensions of the Fire HD 7 is clunkier than the Nexus 7 and is not as comfortable to hold.<br /><br />All that being said, and while I knew that it lacked the GPS and Google products, I also just wanted to try something new OS wise and explore the Free Time/parental controls a bit more closely.  Plus I like how I can share apps and games with my kids- you can't do that with Windows* or Google.  Plus, I'll be able to access my wife's Kindle Book library<br /><br />*In addition to the Nexus 7, I also have a HP Stream 7 (Windows 8.1), and a Windows Phone 8.1 device, plus a laptop running Win 8.1 and another running Linux (Mint 17.1 w/Cinnamon)."
"Fast web browsing, weight, full charge time, battery life and the choice of colors"
BOUGHT FOR WIFE... SHE LOVES IT... THATS ALL I GOT.
I am very pleased with it
Good
Great tablet at a great price. Only wish it had a micro-sd card. This is my second Kindle tablet.
One of the best investments I ever made!
"Well made nice design , too hard to use so far can do nothing without some password blocking BULLS..T ! Next week will take to my son for a show and tell .Hope springs eternal ."
"I bought this as an Ereader. It surpassed my expectations. It was clear and crisp.  The other features were all pluses.  However the weight is heavier than I would like.  I have a NOOK simple touch which has served me well and is lighter, but the page quality is lacking on the NOOK.  I have not familiarized myself with everything yet, but the music and videos were amazing and easy to use. UPDATE;  6/27/15 The Fire HD 7 is sharp & quick.  However, it does NOT perform well in sunlight.  There is too much glare & it is very difficult to read.  I don't understand why it doesn't have the Paperwhite screen or at least a screen like my Nook.  Also, the weight is still a problem  for me. I have to have cortisone shots and possibly surgery."
Awesome. I had the original fire tablet. So this one is amazing. Abs love it
My boys love the Kindle Fire HD!!
Amazing product for the price.
"Great product...Great functionality!  Wish it was &#34;google play store&#34; compatible( There are some apps there that I would like to use).  Also, they shouldn't say it's 8GB if only about 5GB is available for storage....they say &#34;the rest goes to run the kindle&#34;.  But it is a great product...and I got it for $79 !!!!!😀"
Great product.  It's reasonably priced and serves its purpose.  I use it everyday.
I'm still learning how to use this device. Those who are helping me say it is a good value and I believe them. Only downside -- an adaptive charger was not included. But I learned that the device can be charged off my laptop.
Nice camera and is a nice upgrade.
"I bought this Kindle because it was a deal at $79 and my other Kindle Fire was a couple years old.<br />The Pros: Faster processing speed, thinner, sharper display<br />Cons: with the old one and the new one side by side, the new will not pick up wifi where the old one has 2 to 3 bars and runs fine<br />  the new seems cheaply made where the old one seems a lot sturdier<br />  the new has no plug in for connecting to HDMI on TV where the old one I can plug into HDMI and watch my Amazon Prime videos<br />Overall I'm a little disappointed in the new Kindle Fire, I find myself using the old one over the new one. The new one seems to be my backup while I'm charging my old one."
There is a lot to learn but I enjoy it
Love my kindle so many books at my fingertips
Unit locked up can't. Cannot use it.
Very happy with it
I love it!  Received it as a gift...and am thoroughly enjoying it.  The only thing that would make it better is if it was also a phone!
Yes it did meet my expectations
Love it
Love its portability and ease of use.
I love it
"Even though our household has three Android tablets, I just had to give this one a try -- especially since it was on sale at $60 off.  It is very fast to boot up and shut down.  The display is extremely clear and the buttons are in the best locations.  I have found that the Dolphin Browser is best to use especially if you use Chrome on a desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone -- which I do with all of those devices -- because Bookmarks are seamlessly imported and synced to all the devices.  The apps on the Home Screen are easy to relocate if you want to cluster them by types.  The Help manual isn't very informative, but there are several very good, inexpensive e-books for the tablet through the Store.  This tablet may not be the lightest 7&#34; model (my Nexus 7 is a little lighter and easier to handle -- IMO), but it is still comfortable.  The page rotation is fast.  Even though there are not nearly as many apps available in the App Store as compared to Google's Play Store, it has what I needed.  This is a perfect tablet for the newbie, if you are tied to the Amazon ecosystem, or just want another tablet to have some new fun.  I recommend it -- even at full price!"
"Love it, but I have had a Kindle Fire before and to me they are the best tablets ever!"
Replacing a lost Fire and this one is better than the earlier version I had.
"I love my new replacement Kindle!  I had lost my Kindle HDX and was waiting to buy a new one but wanted front and back facing camera which only came with the 8&#34; Kindle HDX. Being on a fixed income I would have had to wait because it's so expensive. This one was being offered for $99 and had all the features I wanted (the same ones my lost one had in addition to the front and rear facing camera); I grabbed it fast!  Except for the weight, it's much heavier, I'm satisfied with this one.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for the weight; much too heavy for an avid reader like myself. I had invested in the Kindle e-reader while saving, so I'll use that during the day for long term reading.  The two were cheaper than one replacement or upgraded HDX."
"Sharper image than its predecessor but much less storage capacity for books, apps, movies."
"Got this one during the sale for $99, which is an outstanding price for a full-featured 7&#34; tablet. My chief complaint, and why I didn't give 5 stars, is the ongoing tussle between Amazon and Google, resulting in an inability to &#34;legitimately&#34; load Android apps from the Google Play store as well as the Amazon app store. As a result, I can't &#34;technically&#34; install, for example, the Netflix and Youtube apps that allow me to cast that content to my Chromecast device and watch streaming video on my large screen HDTV, since the equivalent apps on the amazon store lack that feature. Yes, I know I can sideload such things, but the site for sideloading has some pretty sketchy permissions you have to allow (like the ability to mine your contact lists and send out emails without your knowledge)."
Love it!  Exceededs my expectations!
"I have 2 other Kindles.....one a paper white reader only, and another that is the smaller version of my new one and I love all my Kindles - but this one is awesome :-) I am still learning all the neat little tricks it has the others don't but all in all a great purchase at a really good price."
"From my personal perspective, the Kindle is THE TABLET. I just love Amazon :)"
I am very happy with my fire hd
"Excellent, great pictures and sound."
"Excellent, I love it"
Very happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 7.  Excellent product for the price.
Great product.  Does everything I need to do but without the weight and size of my laptop.
"This is my first device of this type (an iPad-like device) - I'm still learning how to do what I want to with it.  But so far I am more than happy with it for some web surfing and downloading/reading eBooks.  Set-up was straight-forward and didn't take much time.  I can charge it from my iMac or plug it into the household current.  All in all, so far so good! And the price was excellent - was going to buy something less for the same money, then saw a deal on this and jumped on it."
Exactly as presented by Amazon. Great product!  Exactly what I wanted.
"I love my Kindle Fire HD 7.  However, my new kindle has several changes that are not on my older Kindle Fire HD.  Some I like some I don't, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I don't like the new email screen, as I can't make it fit the whole screen as I could my older one.  If there is a way I haven't found it.  Since I'm older and eye sight not great a full screen is much easier for me to read.  Also, when reading books I've found that I don't particularly like the new font Kindle is using,  as it's to fine and light  and I can't change the fonts to a darker bolder font.  I wish there was a way to do this as I don't like the one it came with.  I am planning to contact customer service to see if there is any way to change the fonts and expand the email screen.  Also, there seems to be some changes in borrowing books that I've never noticed before, like being limited to one a month.  Is that new or always been like this?  Being a Prime Member which costs me over $100 a year, it seems like I should not be limited to borrowing one book a month out of the thousands being offered.  Of course this has nothing to do with my new Kindle fire.  Eventually I'll figure out all the new changes they've made to my new Kindle Fire vs my older one.  Right now it seems like it is easier for me to use my older Kindle.  My main complaint is the smaller finer print, it's really harder for me to read it."
Screen resolution is amazing. Quick action. great for game play
Love it! Should have upgraded a year ago.
"love it, much better then the old Kindle."
would have liked written directions
"So far, I'm loving my new Kindle Fire. The different screens take some getting used to compared to the Kindle Fire second generation that I had before. The games are much more clear compared to the other Kindle, and the images of books are crystal clear. The ads featured on the screens do not really distract me as much as I thought they would. I could deal with them. I like the chatreuse color and it looks great with my light blue/turquoise Kindle cover. I highly recommend this item."
"Bought this for my 20 month old as the Kids version wasn't showing good reviews. Overall, we love it. No complaints here. I bought him the kids case that comes with the Kids version kindle and love that too. It's tough and I don't have to worry about anything happening to the kindle."
Love it. Have'nt been able to put it down.
The picture is so much clearer and seems a lot quicker to use the internet.  The only issue I have is that you have to hold down the power button for awhile before it seems to turn on.  The original Kindle Fire seemed to start quicker.
I enjoy my new Fire a lot.  This is my second one and happy to continue on my reading adventures.
This is a great deal for a kindle fire. I got it for half the price and it is a great device to have my daughter love that she can make video's with it great buy.
It is very good for the price. The high definition is great for game playing or watching movies love it.
Long time to charge and seems a bit slow when it comes to games.  I bought it for my kids to use with Kindle FreeTime (wonderful!) but this is my 4th Kindle and I love them!
Not all that content. It's fine when it works but It goes dark on me and I have to reboot. I much prefer my iPad. I like my kindle white but don't believe I would ever buy another Kindle fire.
Great to read in bed
more than i thought and then some
I'm still taking babysteps with this.  I love my other Kindle reader so I know I will love this one once I get the hang of it.  I have too many family helpers that hold it and try to explain to me how to use it.  Facebook can be very overwhelming!!  I know you guys will help me when I get stuck.  Thanks!<br /><br />Betty St. Amour
I really like this product.  I had different brand of tablet and it turned out that it was very unreliable.  I am glad I purchased this one.
so far i love it.
Love the Kindle but wish it had more storage on it
"This is the 8th kindle fire I have bought, 7 were for gifts. Myself and each person I have given one to loves them. I would highly recommend getting a prime membership with it too it enhances your endless possibilities of books, movies, and tv shows. The charge could last a little longer but it still outlasts my ipad. :)"
It's as easy as using a full size computer!
"My family has used Android equipment since day 1.... the G1 phone.  Each of us have at least one Android device and I thought this Fire HD tablet would provide a cost-effective solution to upgrade my toddler's aging tablet.  I expected more of a vanilla Android experience... not completely... but more of one.  I had no idea I'd have to sit down to root the device in order to access my toddler's usual Google games.  No, they weren't on the Amazon store.  This was my first experience with a Fire device.  Maybe my last.  My largest complaint was I had to add my credit card in order to download free software for my kid to play.  Stupid One Click.  Amazon needs a &#34;kids only&#34; experience.  I love Amazon's store through a web browser but the app store on the tablet is painful.  Ouch.  Stop trying to sell me trinkets when all my kids want is Sesame Street games!  Enough about the OS. The processor seems nice.  Loud speakers.  Nice color on the screen.  It feels like a solid device.  Videos playback well.  I got mine for $79 and I wish I had saved my money or paid double for a Samsung tablet. I should have sent it back but once you give something to a child... that's near impossible to do."
Very user friendly and less eyestrain when watching movies or tv series due to high definition quality. Highly recommended than other competition.
I am enjoying my new kindle fire . I wish there were some instructions to it. And I am not sure if I have the link to use like a help desk. If so please advise the process.
"I love my Fire HD 7. I use it for reading books, playing games, listening to music and taking pictures/videos and it works great for this."
"Pros: Very nice, small tablet. Easy to use, convenient. Cons: Would like access to more apps, needs longer battery life."
"Love my new kindle Fire HD 7! I can check email, read books, rent movies, & take pictures--all on one device!"
"I loved my old Kindle Fire but this new Kindle Fire has even more to love!  I think it's fantastic! Easy touch screen, more apps than I will ever use, AND a camera. I would write more but instead I am now going to go read my newest book on my Kindle Fire."
"Works fine, but was not able to transfer contacts and calendar from my MacBook."
Very easy to use.  Big bright screen...easy to see.  Definitely worth the money.
I'm loving it. My books come right up.
"It is a complete redesign of the HD 7.7 purchased even 2 years ago.  Everything from the jacks to volume control are in a different location.  Even the Amazon Sleeve specifically for the unit is redesigned.  I upgraded to the 16 GB so I  don't know if that is why everything is different, but I'm not complaining.  However I think the new software  tries to hard to be intuitive.  When I started to load all the apps and books I own, they would automatically appear on the carousal and favorite locations.  If you deleted 10 item from the carousel, 10 more would appear... VERY ANNOYING.  Eventually I was able to clear the carousel an the other sections, but what a pain in the ass."
So much better than the Nook!
Great
Very pleased fast shipping works great my daughter loves it nice job
"I love it!  Picture is perfect I can watch movies with ease.  Navigate Pintrest, facebook, even shop.  Would buy it again!"
I love my kindle fire. It work great and downloading is fast and easy. My only complaint would be that the battery goes down pretty fast when I'm using it. Faster than my phone. Luckily it charges quickly also. It's great for reading and games and music. It's easy to adjust the brightness as well do reading on the kindle for an extended period of time doesn't hurt my eyes. I highly recommend getting one.
I enjoy the up grade so far. I was already a huge fan.
Excellent sound and picture. Truly feels like surround sound with dual speakers. Easy to use user interface. Love it!
Love it
A little confusing. Too much advertising.  Still trying to add Free Cell!
"Having owned, and daily used, a Kindle Fire 7inch, I found the new one on a Great one day promotion and decided to upgrade. Don't see all that much different...but what I am finding.....not liking it much. I really don't like having a ton of icons on the home screen. Still have the carousel, but instead of the star to tap on to bring up favorites....there is a huge display of everything...just don't like it....toooo cluttered looking and I'd rather have the option to open the file holding them for display. Performance wise...with quad processor and 16 gig...sometime much slower than my old 8 gig. Not a great selling point. It does seem to hang sometimes...and if it does, it's difficult to get out of the loop. As far as running apps....when everything's good...it's great...good speed for graphic intensive apps such as &#34;The Simpson's Tapped Out&#34;....You know you want game info. The slightly different keyboard...does take some getting used to....that split in half to use thumbs mode...evil...out demon! Just don't like it...but I'm nearly 60 and learned qwerty typing, so younger folk may like it.<br />Does get HOT sometimes...not warm, HOT!!!<br />So....final results. I probably would not have bought it with out that significant discount. If you don't own one, this model is probably good for your needs....you really need 16 gig....so wish you could add SD cards....c'mon Amazon...YOU sell thousands of cards...here's another chance to sell more. Give your loyal users a break. We buy Amazon because of price, quality, quick shipment and service...let us have a freakin' SD slot! We  would buy more Amazon apps, music, video, etc....if we had more storage. I know you are pushing cloud storage...but people do get to places without wifi or don't want to use up lots of data minutes....we could put our Amazon music on sd, load it up and take off driving....can't do that with streaming....and you don't want to take up all your memory with music. Also could put prime video onone to watch on a long trip, plane ride (so you don't have to pay outrageous fees)."
I love it.  I never knew how easy it was to use.  The best purchase i have ever made.
Bought this after trying my daughter's. Very ready to use
"After getting my kids cheaper tablets a year earlier and seeing how often my 11 year old daughter uses hers and how it wouldn't stay charged and wasn't reliable I decided to get her a kindle.  I like the fact that I can control what goes on hers from my kindle.  It's reliable, durable and long lasting battery.  She loves it."
Good quality
The reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that the screen has a lot of glare.  I really don't like it for reading - luckily I have an old Kindle.
Camera not good for distance
love this product!
I love it!! Easy to use and navigate. Would highly recommend. I will note thought I have a fire phone which made it easy to use this kindle. It is different then the iphone or microsoft products.
Easy to use; great clarity of picture; musical sound leaves a lot to be desired.
"A lot of restrictions and lacking in many things, but it's great for the price. Memory sounds small (16GB) but it is plenty for what I use it for. I have several full albums on it, dozens of pictures and 15 Kindle novels and two Movies. Along with all the apps I've installed, I still have plenty of space.<br />The onboard browser, Amazon Silk, lacks good support with little customization options."
"I will forever be thankful that I bought my Fire HD 7 tablet. I love, love, love it!"
"I got my Fire HD 7 in the mail 3 days ago. Since then, it has crashed twice, and some apps take 10+ minutes to load. I ordered the tablet because of the number of good reviews, and, since I was only looking for a simple replacement for my outdated Android tablet, this seemed like the perfect fit. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations and is hardly worth the $120 I paid for it."
"Great item for the price.  Only down side is the Amazon App store.  However, you can sideload from Google Store with the proper apps and knowledge."
"Great price, easy to use, lots of aps. Really good camera!"
"I like that it's quick and easy to connect to the web and to order.  But you can't load or use flash player, so I can't play the games I'm addicted to on facebook."
I'm thrilled with my new Fire! I have had two other Kindles and this is the best one yet. Thank you so much. I love  it!
A terrible tablet!
Loving my new Kindle Fire HD 7!!!!  It has so many more features than my last kindle.
"I love my Kindle Fire 7, thank you, Amazon!"
"I purchased the Fire HD to be used as a cheap tablet.  I am disappointed that it does not support google play.  I have an android phone and have built up a library of apps that I would like to also install on the HD.  I probably wouldn't buy the Fire HD if I had to do it all over.  If you want a simple reader only, it's probably OK."
Freezes up a lot.  I liked my older version better.
"Got this on my birthday.. I love it, so far:)"
Perfect size and weight.  I also have the Kindle HD 8.9&#34; and the Paperwhite kindle but this on is my favorite!
meet my needs
Great tablet  Easy to use.  Previous Nexus 7 user.  I find this table as good or better and much cheaper.
love my Kindle Fire HD......It is taking me sometime to get things back from my old Kindle.all my games have me starting all over again 😬 but I'' m sure It will be work in progress for me.Love the free games and books ..... have fun with the camera and texting features...yea!
"Battery doesn't last as long as my last Kindle Fire. Otherwise, love it."
My 8yo daughter loves her Kindle Fire. She enjoys picking books to read and playing games. All around great purchase for a great price.
"Fire HD 7 gave me good impression as first, but feature-limited comparing to other Android tablets and some apps I use crashes frequently. To be fair, this review is for users who is looking to upgrade from an old Android tablet to Fire. I have a Kindle Paperwhite, so I'm one of the users looking for a tablet upgrade, but I can tell you it is not a good idea. Since it's Android based I was expecting at least close to other Android tablets, I have owned 3 other Android tablets and from my experience, Fire HD 7 is very feature-limited comparing to them. Here are the pros and cons from my perspective:  Pros: - Good hardware spec - Easy to use interface to learn - Built-in amazon account integration - Good tablet for the money  Cons: - Unfamiliar Andriod interface - Amazon App store has limited apps comparing to PlayStore. Essential apps like all-in-one tools are not in the Amazon app store - App crashes. Apps like Trulia and Zillow crashes all the time. I've tried force-stop the app, clearing cache, and resetting the Fire, but nothing helped - A bit bulky and heavy for current gen tablets  All in all, it's a good tablet for Kindle users or new tablet user, but look elsewhere if you are looking for a tablet upgrade. I'm kind of disappointed on the Fire Andriod OS, as I had high hope on Fire HD 7.  As some may wonder, is rooting the FireHD7 the answer? For me, yes, definitely. Although I can understand why Amazon chose to develop the Fire Andriod OS, but I think it's a waste of hardware potential and OS stability in doing so. For this reason, I will be rooting my Kindle Fire HD 7 and installing a Custom Andriod ROM. Even though it will mean loosing the support service, it will still be worth it because I can still use Kindle app to read my books while utilizing the tablet as well as the Andriod OS' full potential."
"Has everything I need, books,internet and the web."
Absolutely outstanding
Amazing service and product
This is my third kindle and each is better than the the prior edition. The apps run more smoothly and the color and quality is much better
"I bought this for my grandma for mothers day and she loved it, she likes how she can rad books and watch amazon insta, it's the right size for her liking and I was pleased with the lighting and graphics on this I got it on sale for 99 bucks !! I couldn't beat that"
"I'm glad I purchased it, my son and I have lots of fun on it!"
love it
I like that the power switch is not next to the volume buttons as on my previous Kindle.  Making it easier to operate by touch.
Screen freezes and can't navigate out of one thing to another.  Price was reasonable and this is not my first Kindle.  Kindle seem to go downhill and not work well anymore.
"I have never had anything except for a laptop before and I am enjoying it so far, it's light and easy to use.  I really love it!"
"I really like the tablet size, clarity, color , etc.  HOWEVER, there are certainly not enough instructions to satisfy this retired somewhat technologically dense person, and finding out how to reach tech help is difficult.  I'm still working this out.  Would like a call-back or e-mail from a tech person."
"Great for reading and decent for the apps that you can get.  I was hoping to be able to side load some google apps but no luck so far.  I was also disappointed with the browsing experience, I have no idea why browsing web pages is soooo slow on this thing.  Otherwise, love it and can't beat if for the price."
Need more games available
I got this for my grandaughters.  They love it.  I downloaded some books and games for them.  Love the parental control.  We have the books to read time higher and the games times lower so they have to read some books instead of playing games all time.
Not as good as I expected! Picture are not that good and videos stop and reload on this kindle that my last one doesn't do!!! I am disappointed...
"Great display, short battery life when compared with Certified Refurbished Amazon - Kindle Fire (1st Generation) purchased from Best Buy / Geek Squad two years ago..."
I love it!!
I had an iPad and sold it to get the kindle fire. got it at a great price of $79 and well worth it!
Excellent tablet and reader. Very fast processor and excellent screen resolution and color. The ability to work with the Fire TV device is wonderful. You look up programs on the tablet and watch them on your TV.
"absolutely great-- it is the same size and functionality of a mini-ipad (my husband stole it for a time, when his ipad wasn't working) at a fraction of the cost. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem as though it likes to stay charged--or perhaps I use it more than I realize"
"I'd been watching for another Fire HD 7 at the right price. My Fires keep several children calm and quiet at church. My grandchildren and my 94 year old mother enjoy them while waiting for appointments and such. The picture is great. I would love a little louder volume sometimes but, for the most part it's just great. My friend choose Fire over Ipod due to the wide variety of apps and uses. Also for the ease of use."
love mine
I am still finding new & different aspects of my Fire. It is awesome how fast & easy it  is to use.
Love
I have several Kindles and this is by far my favorite.  I love the color and the ability to do so much more besides read.  I own the Kindle paper white but this Fire HD is so much better that I am going to pass the paper white on to my grandchildren.  If you like crisp and sharp print and color this is the book for you.  I have not explored all that you can do as I have limited time and have gotten into a series of books by Alfred Dennis so I will explore all my options of things to do with the Fire HD 7&#34; (and there is a lot) when I get through with the books. I did take a couple of pictures with the camera and was not impressed but I think that is because I don't fully understand the camera options yet.  That is the only thing I could find a little fault with but I feel this is me not the camera.  Will explore that later.  I did receive this on time and in excellent brand new condition.
"I like it, I'm just a first time android user."
"I really like my Kindle, I am still in the phase of getting to know all the things it can do. I will be loading books.I have been loading movies to watch on an upcoming vacation. A lot less bulky than my old portable DVD player. It has a great picture and very user friendly out of the box"
Love it!!
very satisfied
Bought this unit as a gift. My mother-in-law is still raving about how great it works. I would have to recommend this unit to anyone looking for a tablet at an affordable price. Thank You.
I bought this for my Mother who is 87.  She is not very computer literate and she is able to use it to read books.  It was a great buy.
"smaller than my original and we lost all progress in the games we play regularly, plus all of our moves we had downloaded are gone."
I bought this for my grandson's birthday and he loved it.
looses my place while readng
"Nice...but camera quality sucks!!!!!! I shouldn't even say quality in relation to the camera...quality is nonexistant!!! This tablet is good for Netflix, email, and apps but do NOT buy if you care about taking pics or video!!!"
I love my new Kindle Fire 7.  It arrived ahead of schedule and it is fun learning all of its features.
"Exactly what I ordered and prompt delivery, very happy with purchase."
Very nice.
Great deal good product
"GREAT TABLET!!! Great for movies, surfing the web, Tumblr or anything else!!!"
I love it!
Very pleased so far
"Battery life leaves a lot to be desired, even when performing a simple task like reading.  The on/off button is not easy to depress or see.  The tablet itself is a lot thicker than comparable tablets of the same size.<br />Screen resolution is very good."
I never got this item or my money back. Not very happy at all.daughter was extremely disappointed and so was I.
"I love my new Kindle.  It has everything I wanted.  I can take it everywhere, it is very portable, fits easily in my purse. I give it five stars!&#34;"
Nice device. Easy to use. Perfect size screen.
"Love it! Fast, fun and HD is great!  From Gen 2 to Gen 4 Fire huge improvement."
fiquring things out on it but like it so far.
"Had it for a few weeks. Slim, fast, great for the price. Feeling heat towards top by lens. Rest of surface feels fine. Hope heat doesn't become issue for me, did not get coverage..."
Very good bargain. Replaced my Samsung with this and I am very satisfied.
I love my Fire! I also bought one for my grandson and he loves it too. The only thing is I wish it was easier to use some of the Google programs on it. I'd love to have a easier way to watch You Tube videos.
"Great little device.  Compact, powerful, very useful in a variety of ways, easy to use.  Highly recommended!!"
"first of all i wanted the 16g and got the 8. This is really no different than the original Kindle Fire I already have. Sending it back. WhenI &#34;chatted with an agent it took 3 pages to get a simple question answered. She kept trying to either sell me more stuff or tell me to return it. She even sent links for return labels. Well, she got her wish!<br />I have just gotten my refund for the FireHD and the case. THEY CHARGED ME A REFUND FEE FOR A PRODUCT THEY SOLD ME THAT WAS INFERIOR !!!!! THEY ALSO CHARGED ME FOR THE MAILING OF THE LITHIUM BATTERY IN THE STUPID THING. THIS IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE  ....... EVER !!!!!!!"
Great item
"Really nice. Better than the one I had. My previous Fire was also 7&#34;, but it was a previous generation. This one is stream-lined and I like the fact that it has collections.now. My other one didn't have collections. This makes it easier to find a book based on genre. I am still getting used to the setup of everything, but I like the way this one is organized. If you are looking for a new Kindle Fire, this is one that i wholeheartedly recommend!"
"Everything is fine arrived with all parts and parcels intact.  Plugged it right away, few hours later, turned it on to a bright, clear screen.  Most of my items from old Kindle had been transferred to new Kindle."
I bought this Kindle for my 10 year old and she absolutely loves it! I have a Kindle and my 6 year old has one also and they are so easy to use! Totally worth the $100!
great need more internal memory though
Really fun to use!!
"Love my Fire HD! I use it for reading, watching Hulu, playing games, checking Facebook. Why only 4 stars? Well, first, the super shiny window is a bit too super shiny and gives reflections of everything. The second is when reading an e-book; I can't easily get to the home icon because the highlighting comes on instead - but maybe it's just my fingers. It was a good buy."
I Love!!! My KFire HD 7..
New discounted price! I could justify buying one more for me:)<br />It's a great tool to entertain ones self. Wife loves the one I bought her. Amazon unlimited is turning out to be an excellent resource for her reading. Tons of good books!
love it
Love it
Awesome product.  Love it!! Don't get all caught up in the iPad hype. The quality and simplicity of the Fire is remarkable.  Great price too!! I would definitely give this as a gift during the Holiday season. Great investment! ! The Fire offers a lot to both adults and children.
I love this Kindle!! such good quality screen!
I love it.  I was looking for written directions (book) to be with it.
Love it!
"Great product! I love the responsiveness! I've had several android devices, and this seems to be the most responsive (especially with the keyboard). The display is great, and this is extremely portable!"
It works great my Grandkids love the free time Kindle area.
My son loved it! He read 5 books before bed on the first night. Awesome tool to get your kids reading.
"My house hold already had 1, so to buy 2 more at half price was as no brainier for us. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the operating system. It works well for what it is, and the kids really like them. But I want a tablet that can do most everything my laptop can do, not what Amazon tells me I can."
"Great tablet , really fast. Also so many apps are available to be used."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this Kindle! I had the older 2012 model (which still works great!) and wanted an upgrade so I got this one. I ordered it and forgot to get a case. I dropped it on day one and it did not break, crack, or even get a scratch! It is my favorite tablet EVER!"
"It surpassed all my expectations. I can do everything on it that I can do on my laptop, except for microsoft office functions. Online support is excellent, and there are loads of games and other valuable free programs you can download. I also can use it to download books and stories from the web or the public library in text or as audio books."
My second one. I loved my 1st one. The batteries just stopped charging
"Beautiful graphics and very easy to use,"
"Great improvement over the one I bought about 2 years ago.  It is capable for programs that convert your speech to text.  This is great to use for language translation.  Kindle tech people did not know that their Kindles had this capability.  The apps download very fast, the screen is brighter and the sound is louder than the earlier version Kindle I have.  I am impressed."
"Really enjoying my Fire HD.  It is great for on the go travel, love downloading books and games"
The table works perfectly and is great for watching videos on the go.
"Love it, Thanks"
Doesn't do dishes
"This is an easy to use high quality product. Unfortunately I found the screen to small for my uses,so I returned  but the unit is well  worth the price"
Love it! Highly recommend this tablet.
"Love my Fire, I had an OLD kindle, this one is so much better."
It arrived in mint condition and looks exactly as pictured.  It's really nice and props up perfectly without problems.  Great purchase!
useless
It is great
"I love it, love the color and was thrilled with the price.  Was glad that I was able to get earlier than anticipated.  Thank you for always coming through for me."
Well worth the money just thing is some games don't work. :(
"Love my new Kindle Fire!  Only con would be too short a cord and short battery life when streaming (approx. only 5 hours tops).  However, the 6' cord that came with my Kindle Paperwhite fits the port on my Fire, so I am able to keep on streaming while it charges, even laying down in bed!"
2nd one I bought. Both of my young kids have one. Free time unlimited is great for kids.
the only thing I would change is in the parent controls children should be allowed to buy free games on their own<br />the only time the password should be needed is to purchase games
Excellent and great very happy with the results
I love the Fire HD 7&#34;. The only thing I was disappointed in is that it is exactly the same size as my previous Fire 6&#34;. Both the outer measurements as well as the screen measurements are the same. The description of 7&#34; is deceptive.
Love my Kindle and love Amazon! A few days after I got my Kindle the same one went on sale and within 5 minutes of contacting them I was promised a refund to match the sale price! So impressed with Amazon customer service!
I wish there were more written instructions for the beginner user.
Beautiful
Love Kindle! Our second one
Love it
"Don't like that you can't personalize the background and I would like to get rid of the  &#34; free time&#34; app but can't.  The battery life is way too short.  Other than that, it's ok."
Love it
I'm still learning how to use the Fire but I like it very much.  It is the perfect size.......lighter than my original iPad.  It's also a great bargain.
This is a great device. Great price. I'm happy with it.
"Couldn't wait to get this delivered. Added &#34;Prime&#34; to it and I'm addicted to it. I use it for everything. Music, TV shows, Movies and much more. Barely use my desktop computer anymore (usually only for printing docs). There are so many TV shows and movies I get free to watch and a free book every month. I read 2 to 3 books a month, so this helps keep cost of reading down as most books are also heavily discounted after I get the free one. I HIGHLY recommend Amazon Prime with the Fire tablet."
Having fun with my kindle.  Easy to use and it offers everything I am looking for in a device.
A++ Unbeatable performance for the price!
Love the usability
"Loved my first one, that is why I ordered a second one."
returning for another
"It's nice and versatile, only, it's cumbersome to use.  Bluntly, it needs a handle of some sort!  Unless you're using it on a stable surface (you know, where you'd be using a larger, more convenient, larger-screened laptop or PC anyway...), it's annoying to try to use this device or accomplish any sort of work on it.<br />You can certainly *purchase* accoutrement (naturally...) to make the thing easier to hold and  use, but you shouldn't HAVE to - it should be designed with better ease-of-use in mind, or such things should come with it.<br />It's also heavier than I'd thought and did not come with a stylus.<br />NOTE WHEN ORDERING:  I had selected a color other than black yet the ordering system neglected to realize this and I in my foolishness I had innocently thought that the ordering system would actually note the options I had chosen and didn't realize that one should ALWAYS triple-verify when ordering from Amazon.<br />It hasn't yet proven worth the $79 + yadda that I paid for it, and I'm thrilled I didn't pay more for it."
Yes just sorry I can't get on things like my other kindle but I really like the kindle fire
"Device is a pleasure to work with.  However, with all the options available to me, I have a heckuva time figuring out where the applicable &#34;buttons&#34; are and if/when I can locate them, I am not sure which &#34;button&#34; to tap.  The Users Manual is not as helpful as one would hope.  I do exactly what the manual says to do, but the results are different than what the device actually does, or, there are often no results at all.  A very thorough Kindle for Dummies type of book could be very helpful at this point."
Absolutely love it... so nice to look up things...
"As a:techno-deficit,  it's taken me a while to learn all there is to know but I'm enjoying the challenge."
Love my Kindle !!
"Amazon Fire is amazing.  Works just like a mini computer.  Has all sorts up apps already uploaded into the tablet.  You can check email, play music, read books, search the internet, take pictures, and upload many other apps too for your other needs."
"So far, I have been pleased with my Fire.  I purchased mine to use primarily as a reader for PDFs (often for manuals and colorful instructional material) because I can reformat them large enough to read.  I still use my Paperwhite, mostly for reading recreational fiction.  I may not use all the &#34;tablet&#34; features anytime soon, but it's nice to know they're there.  I checked out a few Youtube videos, and tried some stuff just to make sure it worked, but I'm more invested in reading right now.  Liked the sound though, much better than I have on my laptop!  The screen resolution is sharp.  I like it a lot!!!"
I love the Fire HD 7!  The price was perfect.
Low batter life and had to do a hard reset within the first month I owned it. Never had this problem with the older kindle.
A very good tablet. Plenty of apps and things to do.
Omgosh I love my kindle!! I can read all my favorite books and search the web!!! Ivan even play my favorite games!! This is one of my best purchases!! Thanks Amazon!!
Great tablet
Really like it....but a little frustrated that it won't play or run some games.  Gives me a message that the device doesn't run the right plug ins
"I really enjoy my Kindle Fire so far. It is VERY useful and I plan on using it for my college courses. One thing that would make it better is if there were a few more options for Bluetooth keyboards that are compatible and affordable, or it may be that I just haven't seen them anywhere."
Great for kids...
New to the tablet experience.  This tablet is a good start.
Excellent performance. Great picture
"Our 4th Kindle, the keep getting better with each new version.  And it arrived a week early."
"This is my second kindle fire and I love it. The picture quality when I watch Netflix is fantastic. I love that I can Skype with friends and family out of state. My 3rd generation didn't have a camera so this is an upgrade for me. So many pluses, I've yet to find a downfall."
"Everything is better, from apps to other areas."
So far so good. Only thought is that it could be lighter
love it. works great
Bought this as a gift and my gf has read over a dozen books since I've given it to her. This was one of the only models that did not support certain downloadable apps the reason for not 5 stars
"fire hd is a pleasure to use this is my second kindle fire much easier to use, than my first one."
Excellent device. Absolutely in love with it. The only criticism is the very limited availability of apps compared to ITunes store.
We have 2 and live them
Fire HD 7...Love it!
"Great item, love it!"
"I love it! I had the hd 6 and upgraded when the 7 went on sale and I'm very happy with it. I've dropped it,my car plays his little 3d game on it(he's not very nice when trying to get that rat) and not a scratch. Its perfect to carry in my backpack and very useful when I need to look up something or just want to watch an episode of something on Hulu. I definitely recommend it!"
I love my new Fire Kindle.  It's light weight and easy to travel with.  It replaces my 1st generation version which I have had since it came out.  The Fire is affordable and versatile.
It's a great addition for our family! Easy to use and convenient. Thank you!!!!!!!!!
no comment
Bien
"Disappointed, screen has too much glare, cannot sit outside with it."
"Because I am visually impaired my Kindle fire helps me read much better than my smartphone , especially when texting ."
It arrived on time and it is great best in its class
I'm an IPhone user. The prospect of leaving IPhone scared me. I love my Fire Kindle so much I would consider going to the Fire phone now. Thanks Amazon!
So far  Ao good  Thank you  Aloha
"I love my newest Kindle, the HD7 version because it runs better, faster and lods pages more quickly.  My WiFi connects immediately at home which means I  don't have to set it any more.  I'd like to have my Chrome browser back instead of Amazon Silk because it does not flow as well in my opinion.  There are also a few apps not a available on Kindle HD7.  All in all . it is a solid tablet, easy to.use for reading and surfing online."
Gr8 display. . Easy to use..
My only complaint is I can't get apps from google play. other than that it's great.
Wonderful !!  Easy to use.  Love the color.  Much lighter than my previous one.
I love it! The sound and picture quality is excellent! I highly recommend it.
I like the cleverness of the screen.
"As a media delivery tablet it is great if tied to a Prime Membership.  I only bought for the 'free' book every month.  Anything else, buy something else."
Im enjoying my new Kindle HD. Screen is sharp and clear. Easy to load and update.
Overall a good product. Only complaint is that occasionally the Fire stops connecting to the internet even though it shows it still is and needs to be restarted in order to remedy the problem
"It's  great , I love it."
"The Kindle Fire is the greatest invention since the microwave oven. I could never read before because I get headaches. Now, with text to speech, it reads to me while doing dishes, cooking dinner, writing out my bills, or any time. Now, I enjoy Kindle books all the time and they can be very cheap. I have got into several series and still try new ones. I recommend Kindles to everyone who likes to read. I love my Kindle!"
"I love my new kindle. From the description etc. I thought they were saying that I would get a free case with the purchase but that isn't true. So you will have to get a case for it. Otherwise, its very nice, has cool features, works well."
WOW! I LOVE IT.  !!
I bought the 7 when I actually was going to buy the paperwhite reader.  I found the new size of the reader to be unacceptable and the size of the 7 to be closest to the old reader also at the time they were the same prince.  One negative comment I have is that the glare on the screen is awful on the eyes when you are in a bright room or outside.  Why could you not combine the screen from the paperwhite and the size and versatility of the 7?
Love this!!!
love it :)
Best tablet ever
I have only had it a few days. The setup was easy. Only disappointment so far is that I can't pull up pinterest.  Not compatible.
"Heavier than I thought it would be as well as thicker. Seems quick enough but not light years ahead of my Nexus. I'm an Amazon fan, but this isn't all that I had hoped."
Absolutely love fire hd7!
I like this kindle fire
"I bought this for reading, but I've been surprised by how much else I can do on it. It's a great tablet for the price."
"Had wait for color, and online order would not take the nonsponsored option. However, the customer service staff could not have been better in dealing with that. Nice, zippy performance, great device!  My third Fire purchase and will do it again!"
I AM ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED SO WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT I HAVE FIGURED HOW TO USE IT AS WELL AS I DID. WHO KNOWS MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL GET A SMART PHONE
I really like Kendal fire.
Great
Great tablet :-)
"I bought this to replace my 1st gen Kindle Fire. It's very easy to transition to. Somehow the newer model still doesn't support the ABC and NBC apps. The wall charger is pretty pathetic, it falls out of the plug without any manipulation. If the apps worked and the charger functioned like every other one I have, it would be 5 stars."
"Nice tablet. Does not seem to like Chrome though. Overall, good value for sale price special."
Perfect...love it!!!!!
"Very nice little device.  Have used it to read books and magazines, and to check email so far.  Works flawlessly with good responses to finger gestures.  Love it!!!"
It's so amazing how you can store books in there and carry it with you wherever you go.
It's perfect for traveling and very light.  Did not want to travel with my Fire HDX 8.9
I used the tablet for a some time it was exellent then i gave it to my grand daughter and she was very happy with it Thank you
So far I really like it a lot.
I love this tablet! It is a fun color and great to watch video's on. The sound quality is good! The apps. work well on it.  It is easy to use . Web browsing is fast and smooth!
I like nearly everything about this Kindle. The price is right and it's useful for everything I need to do. The reason for the 4-stars instead of 5 is because it should have easily been equipped with a memory slot. I would have paid $20 extra for this feature. I discovered after purchase that 8GB is not quite enough. 16 or better yet 32 would make it perfect.
"Upgraded it to 16 GB cause I know my Android phone memory gets full quick. The memory is split to two parts so it wasn't what I was expected. I thought it would be one for me to install more apps. I can only use the first 8 GB for apps. The sound is good for its size. Doesn't sound like tin can like other tablets.<br /><br />Doesn't have Google apps. So if you have other apps you have your Android cellphone, you can't use that.<br /><br />The UI is weird if you are used to other Android like on the cellphone. It has two parts that manages apps. The Carousel and the library. The Carousel is where the most recent apps are displayed and under that is the library with all the apps.<br /><br />The only hardware buttons are the power button and volume. There is no microSD slot for a memory upgrade. For the discount price I paid for it it's ok."
Great price and color on Fire HD.  Very pleased.
"The last generation was much more user friendly. Also, wasn't aware I would have to be subjected to advertising each time I opened it. Unhappy customer."
"Love it! perfect for all of my internet needs watching Hulu, Netflix, surfing, perfect for that."
Awesome system!
Love it!
"I like it better then the Kindle Fire HDX 7, just wish there was an LTE version.  The speakers are better than the iPad Air that I own.  I like the seven inch size(try not to laugh)!  It works well with my Fire TV.  Very pleased.  Price was super!"
I am still figuring out how it works but I really like it so far.
Not an Apple or Samsung product but for $79 it definitely is a better value. Browsing  and streaming video work well and the adds (only on startup page are unobtrusive). Very easy set up right out  of the box.
I love kindle! I have a 2nd generation and its still going! Got a newer 4th generation for my daughter and she loves it. Highly recommend! Simple design and yet does everything we need.
I love it.
"I had one of the original ones years ago. Then for some reason stopped using it. Decided to buy the fire 7 and was amazed when they brought up every book I had every bought and put it on my new kindle. I like all the new things I find to use it for, and am trying to figure out just how much I can use it in place of  my laptop. I'd rather carry a Kindle Fire 7 with me than a laptop anyday. Usual outstanding quality from Amazon. Even tho batttery gave out on first day, no problem, they shipped me a nother one and I'm in business, I couldn't be happier."
LOVE IT!!!!!!!!  MORE THAN I EXPECTED.....I'LL BUY ANOTHER WHEN THEY GO ON SALE AGAIN...........
I had the first generation of Fire and I was very happy to see how far them have come. Great device.
I am pleased however I was looking forward to installing and using Whatsapp however this device is incompatible and can't accommodate it.
"I bought my Kindle on sale at Best buy and I love it! Perfect for reading, warching Netflix, or playing games."
This replaced my Nextbook that I had for 1 1/2 years. Love it!!
Epic
Have an original Kindle Fire. Thought a newer model would be faster and easier to use.  Found just the opposite was true. Returned the HD 7
"Recently my kindle gave out so I went shopping for another.  I find that the kindle has become indispensable.  The upside for me would be the dictionary feature, which is much more extensive than my previous model.  The downside would be that I was not able to reuse my kindle case. It seems that they have changed the model design to such a degree that I had to purchase a new case and a much less sturdy case at that. Also I wish there were an instruction booklet.  But so far,  I am enjoying my kindle, find it much superior and hope to continue learning and reading!"
I love it!!! I read so much this is way better than my nook. I'm still learning how to work it but buy this product today
"After three weeks, no matter how charged it is, it turns off...now I have to send it back"
"This is my second kindle fire and I like both of them very much, haven't had any problems with either of them , would recommend  them to friends."
"I left on a one-month cruise immediately after receiving this item, so had no time to work with wifi.  One issue was that all my Kindle purchases appeared on the list of books on my Fire; used my old Kindle to identify archived books and sent them to the cloud.<br />Used the camera a lot on the cruise.  Great pictures and loved the ease of adding a textbox to each photo as I took it.<br />After returning home was thrilled at the ease of syncing my Google calendar.<br />Excellent battery life. . .marathon Solitare games are not a problem.<br />Still much to learn; I downloaded the instruction manual on my old Kindle for ease of working with my Fire.<br />So far, so good!"
Great Price for this Fire HD
Great image and easy to learn to operate
I love it.
Had lots of fun exploring on the unit.it was worth getting the extra GB for viewing movies.
The fire hd is a major improvement in comparison to the original kindle fire. The screen is so much brighter and more vivid in color. Much faster and also I like that it is light weight
Love it!
While well made the Amazon specific hooks and limitations of which apps can be installed meant I had to return it.  I bought this specifically so my wife could use a coupon app from the play store.  Even after successfully rooting the device I could not get Google Play to work and could not find a way to install the app.
I love it. The camera and video camera is great. I upgraded to this one and am very happy with it.
"Love, love, love it.  Sturdy, easy to use, and a great deal."
I'm still getting used to the interface and the small lettering. Given these difficulties and the clarity of the HD display the device is almost perfect. My best example is that this review was written on it.
Well worth the $ 80 I spent on it. Its worth double that!
This is a good basic Kindle Fire HD7 w/ 8 GB. All I wish is that Amazon would have better music and movies with Prime.
"Crisp screen imagines, clean lines, fast response. I love this! Easy peasy to use.<br />Sitting in the middle of my bed Im surrounded with a lap top an android tablet my<br />Fire, a smart phone, 1 hard back and 3 paperbacks.<br />I think I have every-ones business efforts covered...And no guilt for me :)"
"I love it, I don't think I've put it down since I got it"
"Adequate tablet, especially good for games and puzzles, but not as good as iPad and it should be with the AMAZON name attached!!!"
Works great.  Just what I was looking for.
Enjoy the fast way it downloaded my pictures.
"My husband loves his brand new Fire HD 7. He is retired and I think he spends most of the day entertaining himself with the Fire HD 7. Good job, Amazon!"
Better than expected. Clear and fun to use
This is my second Fire HD and it has much more than my old one.  So much more than just a reader which is what I used my first one for.
Worth the money. Not a replacement for a top tablet though.
"I use it all the time, this was a good buy!"
"I really like the size of this tablet.  The picture is crystal clear, and I enjoy watching TV shows and movies on it plus reading my books."
It's a great product.
"Very disappointed by the false advertising of the Kindle Fire HD's durability.  My son dropped his less then 2 ft from the ground, screen shattered and you can't use the tablet.  Should stick with the IPad because at least you are still able to use those tablets with a cracked screen."
Very nice product.Very happy with purchase.
"This is our 5th Kindle and with the exception of the first generation Kindle Fire, the rest have been great."
"I love it. Everything that was promised was delivered. I love the quality of the picture and sound. I love the apps. It is my go to electronic toy. I wouldn't ever buy another tablet add long add they is a fire available. I also love the prime that comes with it. The free two day shipping, the sheer number of free books, videos, and music is overwhelming and awesome."
AWESOME!!!!
Down loads fast.play games  so many books.sound is great.
Just wow very good product and fast delivery
"This was a birthday present for my son, and boy, did I get this one right!  He loves it for the games and I love it for his programs from school, {reading, math, etc.}.  Thanks Amazon for making a tablet that will take what an 8 year old boy can dish out!!!"
"Love this product, its amazing. It's a very good entry tablet. It's good for watching movies, playing games, surfing the web, reading books, listing to music and etc. I would recommend this product. My pros: it has a really good 1.5 ghz prossesor, geekbench score was 749 single core and 1503 multi core, the internet speed is fabulous I experience 31.04 Mbps download and 5.61 Mbps upload. It runs very smoothly. Excellent sound it is extremely loud, with good crisp, mids and highs with extremely good bass, got 84.9 db out of the sound meter. It feels very light. It has cameras and a microphone. Very bright screen with 569 nits. YouTube player does not buffer. Very affordable price, $139. My con's: Too little storage, gives you only 4.5 gb of storage. The battery life is below average, I experienced 6 1/2 hours. Too little ram gives you 1 gb of ram. The front camera is a bit grainy but the rear camera is good but not terrible. Overall I would recommend this product."
I LOVE IT!!!!
It arrived on time.  Works like a charm.
"I received this as a late Christmas gift and I love it. Easy to use, love the gliding keyboard. I'm still getting used to it, but it is such an advancement from my former Kindle."
Love it!
"This device has been amazing!  It is quick, and keeps up with the streaming I do sometimes.  It is also great for reading books, which I enjoy. I have some headphones for it, and while I'm on the bus I can listen to music which is on the device.  Amazon Prime has provided me with many choices of books, videos and music.  Over the last couple of months, I watched the entire series, &#34;The Sopranos&#34;, for free!  I got the 8 GB version for my son, and he loves it.  The only thing I would do differently would be to get the 16 GB one for him."
"My first tablet, and it is everything it was advertised to be and more. I use it mostly for reading books, but it is also great for playing games."
love it!!!!! more than my touch screen computer
"This is my third Kindle Fire. Although it has the highest capacity memory best software and fastest processor of any owned, this is my least favorite. It feels thick and cheap in the hand and the plastic is of the cheap quality compared to my prior ones which were the original fire and the first generation HD7 which all still work and have been passed to family members. My wife has the HDX seven which is of a much higher quality. You can't complain about the value for the money though. The Amazon fire interface is outstanding and I love the connectivity to Amazon prime videos music and of course kindle books and Amazon store website. Limited applications selection but for music video books and media player for the money the fire can't be beat. My biggest complaint on the fourth-generation HD 7 is the location of the volume switches and the power switch when the tablet is in the stand the volume controls are at the bottom and I have to lift the device. The HDX 7 has great power and volume control locations. Not sure why the keep changing around, but this model is just bad in this regard. I've tried three cases so far and this is been the same with each one. All in all a great value for the money though and will stick with the fire for a tablet."
So easy to use.  I love my Fire!
"Exceeded my expectations despite added ads. Long lasting battery. Easy to operate and lots of options. Rarely use my laptop since I got Fire HD. Good choice, great deal."
Purchased fire as a gift.  Wife loves it thus far.
"Don't buy this version. Although it is just 99 dollar, Google play cannot install on this device."
Love it
It is great. I discover new things on it every day. Love the dual speakers. And it's amazing that just one inch larger screen makes such s difference from the six-in h screen of<br />My first kindle.
A great source for all internet interest...
Gift for Granddaughter great for kids so they can down load a book or game and with mom & dad's permission price was great
So nice I just bought another for me
We love it
"So far I love it! My only problem with my Fire HD 7 is, I cant put Candycrush soda on here! Other than that though... I LOVE IT!!!"
Perfect for my son..
"Was awesome until it locked completely up after two weeks, hopefully the replacement will be better."
Excellent...  The resolution is flawless..
Marvelous.  Bought three of these for my friends and family.  Everyone amazed at its capabilities.  Might even get one for myself when my old Kindle Fire dies.
Love it
Great deal on the Fire HD 7 - couldn't pass it up.  Our family is really enjoying all the features!
YOU WILL HAVE TO REPLACE AFTER A YEAR. I HAVE PROTECTIVE CASES AND ONLY USE FOR READING AND I HAVE HAD TO PURCHASE 2 IN THE LAST 4 YEARS.
"My device only has 5 GB of storage space and yet the product description claims 8 GB? I've recently been using Amazon exclusively for all my purchases. This may now change, I'm extremely unhappy, as I purchased the device for an upcoming trip and now I can't download the movies I've bought on Amazon, because I've RUN OUT OF STORAGE!!! W T F? Looks like I'll be returning to Apple products."
"Very happy with the new improved kindle hd 7 2014. Had the 2013, sent it back was not happy with how it worked. This one much better and very much improved! Thank you!"
Great little tablet. Can hold in one hand easily. Nice color.
Great product! I am enjoying using the Fire and learning more about it each day. Appreciate the user friendly prompts!
"nice machine, glad I bought it"
Love it
"Fire HD 7 is a piece of CRAP! If I wantedhuge dissapointment to have commercials every five secs, I would just watch T.V.. Especially when the citi-bank comes up. You can not click out of it. It just keeps coming  back again and again. Then the screen turns blue and you have to shut down. This only happens about every three minutes. What a  huge disapointment. Particularly since it was a Mothers Day gift. How do you tell your child that they got you such junk???????"
"I have only had my Fire HD 7 for a few days, but so far I have been really happy with it.  This is my first tablet and I actually purchased it because my Nook bit the dust and I needed another reader.  I decided to get the Fire because it was not much more expensive than a simple Kindle.  The only &#34;problem&#34; I have seen is that when it arrived the plastic casing was separating from the back in one corner.  It looked like it could easily be popped back on, but I was afraid to do anything that might negatively affect the tablet.  I immediately called Customer Service and spoke to a very nice guy named &#34;Jim&#34;, who was ready to ship out a replacement right away. Unfortunately, a replacement was not going to be available for several weeks, so I decided to see if I could just pop the casing back on, and Jim helped me with it while I was still on the phone.  I don't think this anything that happened during shipping.  It looked like someone was just in a bit of a hurry to get it into the box.  It popped back in right away and everything is great.  Jim made notes in the file about what had happened, and I will call if I see a problem in the next few weeks."
I Had it less than a week and it just got hot after a couple of uses and it fried. Very unhappy with the purchase. Not only that it came with no manuel and the package was very poor and partially open.
Cant beat the price!
Love this tablet! Everything I was looking for and more!
"I have an older Kindle that I have enjoyed taking on vacation so I could have many books at my disposal without taking up room in my luggage.  I knew there was a newer model that was much more than just a reader, but I had no idea what an improvement it is over my older model.  Now I can add my email account, search the web, and take photos with ease.  It's the perfect size to stick in my purse and pull out when I need to look something up or access a guidebook to a new area and then get live directions.  I would recommend the Kindle Fire to anyone looking for a fun and practical tablet!  I was happy to receive this product in return for my honest review!"
I enjoy internet and that I can read as much as I like . I wish that there was more free books available
It is all I hoped it would be
Love it.
"I love this &#34;Fire&#34;! I read my bible,  underline favorites and can highlight in various colors. I can make notes, I can go on and on about what this can do. I have been telling everyone how  much I love it.  It goes with me everywhere.  Best purchase I have made in a long time."
Great.
"I just use the Fire for reading at this time but it shows it can do much more, I hope to play with it and learn more in time"
Worthless for my use. I did not realise that the only apps allowed would be Amazon.  I use several different book apps and I prefer Google Maps and a different browser.  Ads for this product should warn potential buyers that Amazon's products only work with Amazon's products.  No free enterprise allowed.  I will be getting rid of this Amazon product and purchasing a real tablet.
"Excellent tablet backed up by Amazon. Great audio with earphones, great picture with videos, and very stable."
Stopped working after a week.  This is after I already bought apps from the Amazon store that only work on this. Thought I'd stray from Apple and give the Fire a try. Bad decision. Poor quality.  Will stick with what I know works and will be returning and getting an Ipad instead.   Now I'm also out the cost of the apps. Tried contacting Amazon customer service but of course I got shuffled around to four different &#34;customer service techs&#34;  all of whom could not help me.
I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.
Great
"One of the best purchases ever for a child. The parental controls and timer work perfectly, and have turned the owner into a true reader who has learned to manage personal responsibility of use of free time on the internet. There are so many great apps available as well. The YouTube has a different version so the child cannot access some of the adult things that they would otherwise be able to access on a regular browser."
I am very happy with my Fire hd.For the price in my opinion top shelf.<br />It feels like a solid good build and has a very nice display and Dolby stereo sound.You can watch Amazon instant video on it and not on Android tablets.I bought this on a one day special.I wish that I bought 2 of them.This is the 4th tablet I purchased and the best of the lot.I also bought a Dragon touch Y88X for my Mom and so far so good.
Bought item for a Christmas present spent the money for a protective case. device fell off a coffee table and the screen shattered. I was told that they could replace it at a special price!! 20.00 more then what I paid for the original purchase price. Special!! I spend a lot of money on amazon but after this no more not a dime more very disgusted with them
Works well but doesn't hold charge very long
Product is fine.  I am old school and would have liked some written directions to see where controls are.  I did OK finding things on my own.  One concern was low volumn control.  There wasn't a lot of fine control at the low levels.  Very low or loud seemed to be the controls at the lower level.
"I am an avid kindle person. I love it. This my 3rd kindle. I've upgraded again and I am happy about it. The first time I wanted the fire. I ended up gifting away my first kindle. Now I've upgraded again because I thought I lost my first fire!on a plane. Later it was returned to me but I decided to gift that away. Although I still love holding a good book and the smell of a good old bookstore, the kindle is my go to thing every night before I go to sleep."
Love it!  So clear !
"Light weight, can do anything with it"
I was satisfy with purchase of kindle fire hd  7.
"multi functional, and easy to use"
"Love its responsiveness, sound, and size.  Can't beat it, especially for the price!!  Picture quality is superb."
One can not beat the value of this Kindle. I primarily bought this as a gift to my kid. There is some learning curve as I was using ipad before.  After that using this is a pleasure. Very good interface and quality of videos from Amazon prime. I think it is a must have for Amazon Prime members if one want to his prime membership fee go even further !!.
"I had the 2nd generation Kindle for several years and it worked just fine.  I upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD when my old one finally died and I have been very unhappy.  After only 5 months the Kindle Fire just stopped working, nothing would turn on or function what so ever.  I called customer service and went through the trouble shooting steps and when nothing worked they sent a replacement Fire.  The second Fire worked for about a week and then it also just stopped working.  When I called customer service I requested it to be replaced with a NEW Fire because I believe the last replacement was a refurbished model and that's why it only worked for a week.  The customer service was not helpful and stated they could not guarantee the replacement Fire will be a new one, even after talking to a supervisor they still would not guarantee a new replacement.  Don't trust Amazon to provide quality products or good customer service."
Arrived just as promised.
Quit the third day if had it. Sent it back. May try again at a later date.
"too difficult to get on line,  very frustrating for me. I don't think I'll be using it very much."
bought this for grandbaby's they love it!
Best value for any tablet on market!!!
love all the apps
couldn't get use o it.
Got it for my wife and she loves it!
"My son dropped it from bed to the floor the first week he had it. (2 ft.) The screen cracked in two places. I find it amusing that the commercials show this thing being indestructible.  The Price is right, but get a cover on it as soon as you open it."
Great gift idea. Works well. Look for specials on the daily deal tab as I saved over $50.00 for a 16GB 7 inch tablet.
I'm satisfied
"Ordered when the $79 price was in effect. Was impressed with the display and over all operation of the HD7.  That is, until it died abruptly a couple of weeks after delivery.  Set it down on the end table and came back a couple of hours later to a dead unit.  Charger OK, but nothing from the Fire.<br />Sent it back and asked for a replacement.  Got an e-mail that they did not have it in stock so they would just refund my purchase price and I could  re-order.  So, I reordered and was given the original  price although they were then $99.  Unfortunately, I accidently ordered the HD 6 rather than the HD7 and it was too late to cancel. Returned it and my purchase price is being refunded.  All this time I was still using my three year old Fire and it continued to work perfectly.  I do realize that infant failures can occur in any electronic device, but the reviews on the Fire HD 7 are sometimes less than lauditory regarding its reliability.  I do like the faster processing speed and other features of the new unit, but on balance, I wonder if the new unit is worth the low price I paid.  Maybe so, maybe not. I am thinking about it."
Best tablet yet.
I really like my new Kindle
"For the price, love it for reading, checking email, watching movies, etc.  Small enough to carry in my bag and lightweight!  Great resolution and sound.  BIG downside is can't use to connect with in-flight movie service when traveling!!"
I love my hd 7. I am using it right now.
My old Kindle died a couple of months ago and I had been debating between another Kindle or a tablet.  The price of this Fire was great and love how easy it was to set up and get reading. Glad I stuck with Kindle.
"Sorry , can't compare it to an IPad"
Faster than my other kindle
Love the graphics! Easy touch screen! Still learning. Glad I made the purchase!
Most apps seem to work well. Streaming music on Prime is glitchy on every wifi network I have tried. Display is beautifully clear.
Great for travel and easy to use.
Upgraded from a regular kindle fire. While I like the he display the unit feels flimsy compared to the previous one. Still 4 stars on picture quality alone.
"I love this little thing. I was expecting it to be bigger for some reason but that was my fault for not thinking about the dimensions correctly. I love the sound quality, the HD video quality is amazing. There are tons of apps and the cloud storage is wonderful. There is nothing I dislike about it. Me and this kindle are going to be great friends for a long while."
I really find the Kindle Fire good value for the money.  I now have 3 of them in my family so the kids won't keep borrowing mine.  Love it.
Love it it's so light weight a little different than my kindle fire 3 generation as far as set up. Bought cover for it said it would fit but did not. I am happy with purchase.
"Awesome, my husband loves his new kindle tablet.( I am Jealous) I still have the 1st kindle and had it for almost 4 yrs. Still doing great! Maybe one day i will upgrade. We love our kindles. Thanks Amazon!! Great device at a great price of $99.00. Money well spent. Would buy again."
"I received as gift.  I like the size, easy to carry.  I use my I pad more but I like it this product also."
Love my kindle!!
I do not have it yet.  I have a broken one that crashes every time I turn the page.  Thank goodness I have an Ipad and I steal my sons tablet!  NOT HAPPY!  ETA for the replacement tablet is June!  over 2 months after I purchased the original tablet!
"when the Kindle Fire was announced, I made sure I got mine the first day it was available.  But, that was a mistake.  I know that electronics all have a short life-span, but this is a joke.  The hardware works fine, but nothing works on the actual device anymore. my apps all require updates that the tablet can not provide.  There hasn't been a hardware update in who knows how long.  To make matters worse, it's not just 3rd party Apps that don't work.  I can't even listen to Amazon PRIME music on my 1st Generation Fire.  I can't download an App to operate my Amazon Echo (an older Kindle Fire would be the idea 'control pad' for Echo).  If being an early adopter of Amazon products just means you are going to be left behind and not able to continue to use their products, I'm just going to buy something else.  My wife's iPad (that is older than the Kindle Fire) has the ability to do everything my Fire cannot.  I just don't see the point in spending less money on an inferior product if it's going to last for a shorter period of time, and I'll just have to buy something new anyway."
I love it.  Does much more than I expected and I am still exploring it's capabilities.  Very pleased.
love this kindle
Sorry but I'm not impressed with the Fire HD at all. I haven't decided what I am going to do with it. Right now it's back in the box.
Great for my purse when traveling.Love the kindle.
"Wife is enjoying her new tablet, a bit disappointed it doesn't run vanilla android apps. Otherwise she loves it."
It is a great device for the money.
Great product!
"I haven't had a chance to use all the options, but what I have used I really like."
Excellent tablet. The new generation is improved with the rear facing camera.
Works great.  I have had one for a year.  Now my wife has hers.
"Not user friendly. Slow. Called technical support, got hung up on for &#34;wasting his time&#34;"
love it.
Great tablet for the price.
Exceptional
Bought this for my 82 year old mom and even she loves it.
Excellent love it.
Great tablet but app store has a limited offer
Really cool does all I need it to do
This product has surpassed my expectations. I also save about 40 dollars when I bought it on sales last month.
Great Product
Disappointed with this product. It simply would not hold a charge and refused to charge when plugged in.
Nice!
"Once I adjusted to the smaller size as compared to my old tablet, I love it.  The display is so sharp and crisp!  And it's so fast compared to my old Toshiba. And I bought it when there was a super deal for $79. How can you go wrong!  It's perfect for my needs."
Absolutely love it!
"I liked that it is capable of reading out-loud my NYT subscription, that blowed me out. I didn't like that up to this point is incompatible with MS Office Suite, a deal breaker for me."
"Love it, love it, love it!  So convenient, always handy for a recipe, or to check the news or email. Having a great time with it.  Sorry I didn't get one sooner."
Hi there people
Awesome!
"This tablet meets almost all of my expectations. I do wish that i could make it a bit more personal by changing my background pictures and screan saver picture. Without the ability to do this, it seems a bit sterile and business like. However, this being the reason for purchasing it, I can't complain to much. The display is beautiful! The processor is very fast, playing videos and loading apps without pausing."
"I just my new Kindle HD7.  It is replacing my Kindle Fire which quit working.  So far, I love it.  I loved that it was so ready to use.  Pretty much the only thing I had to do was get it covered with my McAfee Multi Device protection."
Great tablet love using it don't see any problems with it yet.
"Terrible. Not like my last Kindle that only lasted a year. This one, the volume goes down or off when watching a movie. Will sometimes continue to play after power is off. Crazy. I'm saving for an iPad mini. Get what you pay for."
so far it is great..For my Husband.
I like it very much
Love it so far.
Love it!!!  My first tablet - glad I waited.  Outstanding buy for the price.  I know it can do more than what I've done already - excited to see what's in there.
I absolutely love my kindle!!! Plus I got it on a special which is really great too!! Thanks Amazon!!
Husband and I both got one and loved them. They are more than I anticipated. Neither of us are real techs so these are great.
Love the Kindle. Have to learn the new ways though. But it's awesome!
So far I really like my new Fire HD.
"This is a n e-reader with a few enhancements. You can't download all the apps you can  on a small tablet because according to tech support, they are not supported. You can't choose the browser or do some of the other things you can on a tablet. Found it difficult to set up and had to call tech support. Not happy with it. When it is time for a new one - I am buying a tablet again and downloading the kindle app."
"Reliable, fair priced, great speaker...amazing product.  My third kindle and certainly not my last."
It was a great surprise to see all that it does.  It is almost like an I Pad.  I love it and am still learning all its wonderful features.
"Spent two weeks with customer support getting it to function properly.  Now it's just amusingly temperamental.  You may do better buying a pet, a paperback, and some CDs."
Love it
Has been a good tablet. Nice resolution. Pretty fast. I don't like that I have to have a credit card on file to get the free apps.
"Have had all generations of Kindles and Kindle Fires. This is the best by far! Super fast, inexpensive and a lot of fun to play with. No afraid to carry around for the price. My 1st gen Kindle Fire still works great, very durable...."
Like many others could not connect to my wifi. Open public wifi no problem. Contacted amazon help 40 minutes later they said they would replace but it would 7 to 8 weeks for delivery. I opted to simply return it.<br /><br />Device was nice/easy to operate great reslution etc...
Exactly what I exected.  No better product for the price.
Great product.
Love it.  Especially now witn the camera I'm glad I updated my the old kindle fire with fire hd.
Great device at a fantastic price!  Has the majority of the functionality of any of the high end tablets on the market.  Love it!
This is my fourth Kindle and they just keep getting better!
Take it to school watch hulu and other shows play games read it is invaluable
Great!
Minimum repair for 5th Gen. IPod touch $120 new Fire HD7 16 gig $119...love it more no more rotten apples!
I like it better than the original fire but one feature the old one had that the new one has is HDMI attachment.
"I bought this to replace a Kindle 7 HDX that I dropped and broke I was delighted to find that all my books and apps were there waiting for me when I fired it up. The performance I have experienced with this unit has been excellent! I use this to read and to watch video, the quality has exceeded my expectations!"
This is an awesome product. Very easy to setup and use. Just a few minutes after I unpacked it I had it up and running. Very nice and clear display. I LOVE it!!!
"I had the original kindle fire and this one is MUCH better. The display is so much better! Plus, this one has the 16gb option so the memory is much better too. Plus, the speakers are better and the power button is on top instead of bottom which is nice too."
I love it!!
"It's such a pleasure to use the touch screen vs the old, original Kindle. I really love all the new features & acsessability."
I've had it a few weeks and I LOVE it.
"Excellent product for the price, can't beat that!"
I want to know why it says 8g memory when alli got was 3g
the tablet looks and feels very nice I was a big Google fan and found out I couldn't get Google on the tablet very disappointed and hard to talk to someone if you have a problemthe guide is really not that good
Very pleased
This is my 2nd Kindle that I have bought and love  it. It is easy to navigate and meets all my needs.
I got this it is our third kindle in a household. I love kids kindle time.
Still learning but it seems like a Great product so far!!
"Excellent product.. great price, kids love it.<br />Recommend to all."
"Love it. Very clear, beautiful colors. Haven't really used it for everything yet.<br />Love my books!<br />Much clearer than my nook simple.<br />Very fast on internet."
"So far, so good.  It would be nice to have some basic instructions that are not loaded on the device to get started.  If you are brand new to the Kindle as I was, it's hard to get going.  Other than that, I'm thrilled and anxious to use it to the full potential!"
"Nice device for the price--excellent sound and picture.  Now the downside--you cannot enjoy any subscription on the browser or app that you do not buy through Amazon!  Though I have a subscription to New York Times digital, I cannot enjoy it on this device, as an example."
"I love it, so does my granddaughter."
My 3yo used it for less than a week and it started shutting off the wifi for lack of memory/storage. There was hardly any games on it! Returned it and now unable to locate a 16Gb anywhere.
AWESOME! It has exceeded my expectations. The kids totally love it. I love it.
Great computer  And great delivery  Thanks for making my shopping so easy !<br />Elizabeth
"I am used to the Android OS, Fire OS seems less flexible"
"So far, so good. However, I am frustrated that I can't access and use my Google Play like I did when I was on my Nook. See that there may be ways to do this, but it seems that to do so would void my warranty. Would really appreciate it if Amazon would find a way to incorporate this as well as the other apps."
love this
"Looks nice.  Some apps work.  Right out of the box it was kicking me out of apps and sending me back to the home screen.  If you have a smart phone like the gs3 from samsung and you think this tablet will be some what like it,your wrong.  you cant have anything google with this tablet."
"Great color and display size, very user friendly, highly recommend"
I love it it works very good living it!!!!
"This device is excellent! Perfectly clear images (video, books, etc) and easy use. I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade from my e-reader."
I like the HD7.  I had a Fire before so it was easy to move to the HD.
It's simple and easy to use.
Great
"I purchased this for my 5 year old grandaughter, it is easy to use works great for her apps and games.  No issues accessing the internet on this table.  Very light and has a long lasting battery.  Would recommend this to anyone!!!!"
Faster and clearer than the Fire although I don't like the advertisments on the opening page. As yet haven't found a way to get rid of them. The camera is very clear and takes great pictures.
"Kindle is the best.  I am never disappointed.  I have had my other fire HD for a couple years and I still love it.  Every once in a while I have to force stop a program, but heck it's lasted longer than my laptops!"
This is the best tablet for under 150 dollars
I was very happy with my Kindle fire HD 7.  It has met all of expectations.
Loved it!!
"NO ISSUES, ARRIVED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED .VERY HAPPY SO FAR  BOUGHT WHEN THEY WENT ON SALE PERFECT FOR ME JUST LEARNING THINGS WITHOUT THE KEY BOARD SO THIS IS PERFECT  I LOVE IT"
"Great screen quality, however a lot of apps are either missing or the quality of it is no where close to what you have on other platforms. Buy it, only for reading."
Love my fire HD!
"Still getting acquainted with it really, a few snafu's with some of the apps, but optimistic!"
Great
"As expected, a wonderful product."
"Do I really need to say anything?  Cheaper then iPad, does as much, no brainer"
Love it and for my first tablet it is easy to use!!
"I love it do far, still trying to get used to it. But love it"
It is so much different from my first kindle.
Picture is awesome compared to my older kindle fire HD. The price was terrific.
"My new Fire HD 7 Tablet is a great little tablet.  We bought 2.  Great price, too."
Very good but the battery does not last long enough.  I went to Office Depot to buy a Paperwhite but. They were out of stock.  That would have met my needs better.
Exactly what I need and works great.  I like everything about it.
well had a hickup here and there but the online help was able to fix the problem!
This is a perfect device. I am hoping for a more durable case for this newest model.
"The tablet is strong, fast, handy and brings some efficient apps, in general, more than expected.<br />Although it has some things that bother, for example, you can not make your lock screen personalized with your own image.<br />There are also apps good on the Fire phone that are not available for the tablet. It has no place to install an SD card to add more storage. Otherwise it's a good deal for the price."
I am so glad I bought my Fire 7. This is my first Kindle and am still getting used to it and am going to have some one show me more about it. A help book with it would an great idea for us older people. Would still buy it again.It is easy to use.
I love the Fire HD 7. Easy to use!!!
Love the new Kindle.  Lite weight.  Clear screen.
"Works great.  Simple and Cost effective fun for my child.  Slow boot up time, but other then that, no issues."
Much better and faster for gaming.
Excellent
"I really love my tablet,it's very easy to use"
Very nice fire hd.
Enjoying using it. Great product
"The Kindle Fire is by far the best tablet available. The durability and compatibility are amazing, this thing is tough as nails and stands up great with my children. We have three Kindles in our home and wouldn't have it any other way"
"It's a tablet with a kindle! Makes it simple to order a free ebook and read it daily! Easier to read my emails on this larger screen...and can speak my replies! Games are easier to see and play, too!"
"I really didn't expect it to perform so well so it was a pleasant surprise.I am able to do all of my internet shopping (Amazon is the only place I trust) and watching my Prime and Netflix videos with Blue tooth headphones. I bought this for fun but it could do most work for folks at a budget price.<br />I recommend a stylus, cover and screen protectors. My hands are large and I had to zoom the screen to do anything. The stylus I bought took care of that extra step. Video runs smooth and the sound quality and volume are very good. If you like movies and music you may want to get blue tooth headphones for a movie theater and live concert quality sound, they are inexpensive and well worth the money."
"Love all my Amazon Fire products. Each generation gets better and better. Gives me access to email, games, the internet and all the books I could ever want to read."
"Love it!!  I have a Kindle DX, but with this Fire HD I can download books from the local library, that is fantastic!  I haven't tried all the fun things yet, but will soon!!!!"
much better than expected.  fast and smooth and easy to us.  far prefer it to my samsung galaxy tab
My nephew loves it.
"Love my Fire HD, looking forward to reading and playing games. Have one question, if I delete all the books on my kindle will it also remove them from my husbands kindle. Our reading preferences are different?"
Just what I needed.
I am enjoying it more than I expected...thanks!
Very satisfied with  the ease of operation of the device.  Surpasses all my expectations!  Surprises me every time I fire my FIRE up!
Still learning about all the features on it but I'm enjoying it.
"Loved my 1st Kindle, then loved my Kindle Fire and now love my Kindle FireHD.  These are the BEST devices."
I like how easy it is to read the screen and type on the keyboard.
Love this and it holds battery life so long am really pleased with it
Love it!!!
"Gave this as a gift to a friend stuck in a hospital bed after a bad accident since he is a Prime member.  Was happily surprised at its speed, easy setup, and surprisngly good sound from the physically tiny speakers.  I've always beena  bit skittish because of its non-standard Android interface, but given his limited mobility in his hands, the big icons on the carousel for his favorites makes a huge difference and he couldn't be happier.  VERY pleased with this - especially since I was able to get it on sale.  Just wish I had gotten another for me..."
The more I discover the more I like.
"Very pleased with my Kindle Fire. It is a great platform for reading, and accessing the Internet."
Arrived in great condition and so far everything seems to be working great. For the price I'm thinking of ordering another for my son. I ordered it for my husband who wants to read books. I also ordered a case and clear protectant for the screen.
"I purchased the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; for my daughter for Christmas the year before. It has always been in its case, never dropped or banged, only charged only using the Amazon charger & well-taken care of. One day it just randomly cut off on her & never came back on! We troubleshooted it & did the whole 40 second power button thing a million times, even bought the new 9W $30 power charger & NOTHING. Contacted customer service & they don't repair (huh?)...they offered me to mail it back & a $14 credit towards the purchase of a new one?!  $14?! So I mail it back, they'll refurbish it (of course) & make $100+ off of me?! Not so much! I'll never purchase another, better off buying an IPAD at this point.. better quality AND customer service. Buyers beware."
Kindle is pretty awesome. Good for very casual usage. Clear screen and fast. Great value for the price.
Satisfied. Does exactly what I wanted a little tablet to do.
It is an awesome tablet..perfect size.. I probably wished later that I got more gigs. I can take it outside and watch movies.or whatever reading too
Love it......
"Nice tablet for the price does everything it said,could use better search engine,would buy again."
Love kindle have one for every family member
"This is a bit on the slow side and the user interface is not as intuitive as an i-pad / i-phone. I bought this because I'm a Prime member and with that I can download some movies / tv shows etc and watch offline (I'm a cheapskate and don't want to pay for movies on plane rides). Internet browsing can also be slow, even with a good connection.<br /><br />Screen size is good for watching movies / reading.<br />Battery life - standby sucks a lot of power. For the way I use it (maybe once or twice a week), it makes sense to completely power it off. Then it holds charge quite well."
"Screen is smaller than my Fire HD; however, the picture is clear and crisp.  It was easy to connect it with my WiFi network.  This Kindle will be used mostly at home, while the larger Kindle will go to camp.  Good buy.  Price was excellent for a quality product."
"Great!!!! I love you tablets all of my four kids have one as do I. I prefer them over apple, with the prime the possibility for entertainment are endless. ...thank you amazon"
"My husband had given me his old kindle when he updated but it was hard to see what books or to read in B&W.  For Mother's Day he gave me the new FIRE HD & it is amazing!!  The clarity is incredible.  Very light touch needed, easy to sync with the Cloud even at my age of 66.  I love it!!!"
I'm very pleased with this product
"GREAT BUY FOR THE MONEY.  I got it for my daughter and I thing I will get one for myself.  Great quality, speed, and picture quality is fantastic."
Excellent small tablet
I love my kindle fire.
I love is the best  I so happy to buy this tablet
This is my 1st tablet so I can't compare it to anything. So far it does everything I expected. I am still in the learning stage.
Caught it on sale for half off and haven't regretted it one bit. Great for E books and simple browsing.
Now that I have played with it awhile. It us not as sturdy as my older model. I was playing a game and I thought the it was going to break just from me holding it. I put in headphones and it made a noise and would not work. I took the headphones out and it took awhile before it had sound again. While listening to music it cuts in and out. Typing is better. Very laggy for a new device. It was hard putting charger in the first time it didn't fit well.  I am disappointed in device.
Love it!
Love it
Love it every member in the home has them
Love it.  Just wish I had gotten the 16.The major thing is that I had ordered a black and got a white one.I had already put a lot of games and programs on it that upset me about QVC---so I am stuck!!!
Mother-in-law loves it she plays all her games on it keeps her occupied
"I do enjoy my new Kindle, I have one that's 2 years old but I decide to treat myself to another love it."
"came charged, bought for 5 year old daughter, but I am keeping it and giving her my old one!!"
The ads were so intrusive that I could not use the internet or apps.
Very nice.
"If you are looking for a tablet or something alike, I would strongly recommend you to get a kindle Fire. It's an awsome device, and its price is very affordable too."
Love it
Nice
"Great 7 inch screen, got Amazon Prime and Netflix going. Very good sound. Easy set up of email account. Also using it as a Kindle reader since the new readers do not have &#34;text to speech&#34; Good buy for the price."
"This is my second Kindle. Have the Fire 8.9 HD. This one was such a great price, I couldn't pass it up. It's a cutie and does thejob. Fits better in my purse."
"Was tired of lugging my laptop on out of town trips.  I have a Kindle Paperwhite for books and love it, so this was a logical choice for checking email and facebook when I'm away from home.  Love it!!!"
Love it!!!
Not what I expected.
"I got this on a great sale, so much less expensive than an iPad and has the capability for most of what I use the iPad for."
This kindle is better than my last one. I love it. The display is great and the apps run smooth.
Love this tablet. I read on the bike at the gym and it is perfect. I love it.
We had our Kindle Fire HD 7 for only 1 year and 4 months. Then it died. Not a very pleasant experience. Customer service was not very helpful. Very disappointed in amazon.com.
Wonderful! Colors and picture are so amazingly clear. Easy setup.
"I love my Fire 7, 7&#34; HD Display! Graphics are beautiful, WiFi access and of course great reading of books."
Love it!
Great tablet for everyday use.
"I received this Kindle Fire HD 7 as a prize in a sweepstakes drawing. Prior to this I had the Kindle Fire HD 1st generation and I love it and have used it a great deal.  The  differences between this 4th generation Kindle and the 1st generation make it a great deal easier to use. My only concern at this time is in regards to the audio. I've noticed that when I use certain applications, the volume goes up and down.  Overall though, it's a winner!"
"Received the product as promised.  Ordered this device for my wife, who was using a Kindle Paperwhite.  She MUCH prefers the Fire HD."
This is my 3rd Kindle.....they have replaced my laptop.  So much easier to travel with one of these.
Is great and very affordable
love this product
Have only had it a short while . Am very pleased with it . Really good display .
Very pleased 😊
I am totally satisfied with my Kindle Fire.
"Pretty much what I expected to receive. Though I wasn't sure how brilliant the color would be, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I know it's advertised as a 7&#34; Tablet, and I received a 7&#34; Tablet...it's just that 7&#34; is sometimes smaller than we thjink it will be. And that's my only gripe about it.<br /><br />Otherwise it works flawlessly, downloads my purchases lickity split, and has an easy home page.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with it, and recommend this device to anyone considering it."
Perfect !  Does everything I expected and very easy to use.  What a deal !
I love it!!!
I really like this tablet.  It is user friendly even for a non tablet user.  I also feel good about my grand kids using it.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! :)
Love the speed.  Also have 1st generation fire. This one is a lot faster.  Display is outstanding.
Good starter tablet
My wife loves it!!!
love it
I was trying to find a case with keyboard storage for the HD7 7&#34; but there weren't any.  Also some of the apps were not as user friendly as the Fire.
It works great
"Love my new Fire HD!  It is just a step up from my Kindle Fire, but it is a great step.  It has a quicker response and I love that I can play music from my Kindle music library while I am reading from my Kindle books.  I also love that it came in a fun color I selected.  I haven't had a chance to try the camera or some of the other features, but I am happy with it!"
"I like it , but it should come with something to help you learn how to use it"
I like it!
Love it..so much better than other ones that I have had
works great
Was easy to use right out of the box. All you really need is your Wi-Fi password and everything else is cake. Would definitely recommend.
I bought the Fire for my wife for Mother's Day.  She loves it!  She wanted a resource for summer reading and to watch movies and shows from Prime and Netflix.  She got what she wanted and more!  Excellent picture quality!  Th
"Awesome, very easy to use."
Love it.
"Really like the HD 7.  I opted for increased memory.  It performs similarly to my HD 6, but with a larger screen.  I wish I could have afforded the HDX 7, but his one does everything I need, and then some."
do not Like the fact that is exclusive for amazon. Apps
Love my Kindle! It's the perfect size to read and easy to hold. For those who just want something to use to read mainly and maybe a couple extra things. This is perfect. I have a ipad and this is much better to read on and more options for me.
I think this was a great purchase. I had bought it last minute to keep my 3 yr old occupied on the plane and upgraded to a 16GB for downloading. I have Amazon Prime so the streaming is amazing. This more than kept my son entertained when needed in-between other activities. Its great for me as well with watching the shows I want from my Prime account.<br /><br />I do wish there were more truly free apps as a lot of the free kids apps only give you access to some of the items and then you have to purchase additional. Not bad at all just something I think would improve my use with it. I also prefer reading with this instead of my basic Kindle. Overall we got this for a steal price and am super happy!
I love it! !!!
I don't know what took me sofa king long to finally make this purchase but I'm glad I did! A great investment!
Set up easily-- All worked well from the get go.  Very pleased with Fire HD.
8gb is not enough storage for anything.  This was for my son there is not much on his tablet and it is already running into storage issues.  Other than that it works fine.
Best part is I can read outside in the sunshine. It's the perfect size.
Don't know howI lived without it. Great product. I love it!
AOK
On it now..love it!!!😀
The fire HD 7 is a great tablet by all means but me being an android fan I found a few problems like there's No customization what so ever which hurts or No external storage and Amazon's appreciated store is akward if you're use to android or apple products bit other than this minor defects if you'll call them it's a great tablet I use it all the time for a varity of things
We love it
It's nice and it works really good
"I like my new Kindle Fire very much!  I can read books, play games, play music, look up the meaning of any word, log in to my facebook, and emails.  Also, there is much more that I haven't had time to explore yet.  Very easy to use!  Would recommend it to anyone."
Hard to use.  Starting to manage.
Like this tablet very much.
My daughter loves it.
I havent really gotten to use it much but it seems nice the only thing is the picture shows colbat as more blue then purple and my kindle seems more purple then blue but since I put a case on it its not as big a deal as it would be if I hadnt planned on using a case since I dont really care for purple . Cant wait to download some books to start using it.Ok so after using it some time I decided I needed to update my review. I bought the 8 gb and I just figured it would come with 8 gb to use well only about 4.5 gb are available the rest is taken up and I have tried deleting stuff but everything preloaded isnt removable so I have to remove my books and stuff as I read them. And it is constantly freezing on loading so I have to turn it off then back on. It also flips back and forth any time its bumped by my son which is annoying because that's usually when it freezes. Was planning on getting my son one but now Im thinking he will be better off with something else that has more usable memory.
I love it! Has a ton of apps I use everyday and the battery lasts forever.
Excellent product.
Very amazing device:-)
"Books, audiobooks, music, apps, beautifully clear screen and ease of use. What's not to like about the Kindle Fire HD? It's light weight for reading in bed. Now I just need to get a cover for it."
"Love my tablet.  It is a bit tricky getting to the settings.  When I change the brightness or font in the settings, the change is not reflected.  Overall, I love this device."
Yes I love it!
Very happy with my Kindle Fire.
"Excellent.....really enjoying the ease of using this tablet/reader. Love that it has a built-in camera with lots of storage for pictures too. Graphics are superior compared to my older reader, especially for gaming.  Very satisfied with quality and ease of use. Highly recommend."
"I purchased this item 1 year ago for $155.00 and I would not recommend it to anyone. It will crash when running an app that requires a lot of processing ability and the kindle fire is not suitable for any high performance app for game play only apps for reading/weather/news. Furthermore, I was very disappointed when I called customer support and all they said they could do for me in order to fix it &#34; is to hold the power button down for 30 seconds&#34; which no matter how many times I did it, the problem was still unresolved. With the newest kindle fires now cheaper than ever, I would expect amazon to at least let me send it in for them to take a closer look at rather than telling me to reset the device, which is clearly not the case since it constantly crashes and powers off at the most inconvenient of times. This tablet is low quality and their customer support supports my opinion, so I gave it 2 stars."
"I adore this tablet/reader. I already owned one of the first Kindles (a handmedown) and was planning on holding out for the Paperwhite when I purchased another, as I thought I was really only interested in the reader.  Amazon ran a killer deal on the Fire HD ($79?) and I thought, &#34;might as well.&#34; So far, I absolutely LOVE it.  I use the tablet functionality far more than I had anticipated, and the reader suits my purposes as of right now. I've not had to challenge it in much &#34;sunlight&#34; reading as of yet, but think that may be the only downfall that I'll find with it.  Would recommend!"
Way better than what I anticipated. Great device for the price!
beautiful graphics wonderful color light weight durable
"great display. good graphics, faster, smoother than my ancient first generation Kindle Fire. I ignore the adverts, they aren't too invasive. I'm still getting used to the minor differences in the controls. I find it difficult to use  the brightness control and reading things like the time and the battery life. I'll adapt but it could be allot easier to use if it were designed differently. All minor annoyances"
"I like my fire, but it is slow, my phone is faster.... camera, not a fan.... Use it more for games and videos..... But I do enjoy it.....just the speed"
Love that finally a Kindle can print! Email has a few issues for me.
"Great little piece of technology, except the glare from the screen is like looking into a mirror during daylight hours"
Good products and fast service
GREAT
This is an excellent product for the sale price I was able to acquire. I would strongly recommend to purchase
Everyone should own an Amazon Fire and a membership to Prime for all the benefits of enjoying the Fire.
"This was a gift for my son and he's been happy with the device. It's working as advertised and is simple enough for my 10 year old to use. It's great around the house or other locations where WiFi access is available. My reasoning for 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the limited storage capacity. There needs to be a larger storage option available, or even better, SD card support. As it stands, I've been able to load some local videos onto the Kindle so it can be used while we are on the road. I've also purchased a portable streaming media device so there are other options for him to access media while not at home.<br /><br />All this being said, it's a great alternative over the higher priced tablet devices on the market. It's a good price (bought it during the recent sale) and performs well. The build quality is higher than what I'd expect for the cost. I'm sure my son will test the Kindle's durability. For those trying to decide if it's worth the cost to purchase the No Ad model, the advertisements aren't that disruptive. I've only seen them at the lock screen which seems like a minimal distraction. You can always pay the extra later if the ads start to bother you."
Love it!
"It is amazing,I love it."
Got this for myself and I love it!
This is a barely adequate tablet with a short battery life.  I expected much more.
I love it easy to use
Doesn't stay in case very well
just love it
Wouldn't  own any other  type of tablet. I believe  the Kindle is unique.
"Should have ordered with 16GB memory, constantly deleting stuff so it has enough memory to run with wi-fi turned on.<br />Otherwise it functions just fine."
Absolutely love it!
love it
Really like my new kindle.
I got it for my mom for Mother's Day and she loves it. She is an avid reader so this was perfect.
Not that great still have not figured it out
love it
Awesome product. A pleasure this use.
Excellent product
Easy to use.  Very similiar to my old Kindle Fire. I like the newer features and the apps. The one negative is that my old case doesn't fit and neither do my old plugs appear to fit. This is a poor selling point.
"Love, love it.  Best of all it came already loaded with everything from my previous Kindle that got ruined.  Wonderful!"
daughter loves it
I love this product. Great for the price I paid.
"Bought this for my husband who tablet was getting old. He LOVE the ease of using it, the size and the weight of it. I have had a kindle fire 8.9&#34; that I love but might have to borrow this one when I travel."
Lighter than my old one and love the rear facing camera.
Awesome
Great Value
"I was really looking forward to having this, but have found it very difficult to use...for example, after much frustration, I'm STILL trying to find out where the volume control is.  Trying to figure out how to do the simplest things is a hassle, and it will probably end up unused in a junk drawer somewhere...I'm disappointed."
"My daughter who is 11 absolutely loves it!! It has been the best item I have purchased for her in a long time....it was a birthday present so it also made me &#34;the best mom ever&#34; , and that I couldn't thank you enough for!"
"This was a graduation gift for my granddaughter but she is very happy with it. I asked her about a recommendation and she said 5 stars so I am going with that. :) She said she used it for games, wi fi access to the internet, movies and she draws art on it. 5 stars."
"Amazing graphics and gameplay. My only complaint is that the appstore doesnt have some apps, so you need to side load them. Asides from that, the perfect tablet."
Not as expected
"Looks very well made for a made in China product! Had it a couple of weeks with no problems. Charging line is kind of short in comparison to my paper white. Like the color choices. Will add more at a later date when have used it some more. It is now 9/08/2016, and no problems. You can watch movies and other stuff with good fidelity. It is really like a big phone. Have now had this unit a good while,(12/24/2016), as of this writing and have no complaints at all with it. Vids are great and sound is great for a unit this size. The things you can do with this unit are ever expanding!!"
"Love the vibrant colors. Perfect size. I went from a Kindle white to this and I love all the added features. I can read my email, books and watch videos! Would recommend."
"Great tablet! Purchased for my 9 and 6 year olds.  They love it.  I purchased 2, one for each and it was a little cumbersome creating the profiles for each linked to my account, but I eventually figured it out. I love the parental controls. It makes it so much easier to protect and limit the amount of time spent on games while allowing for unlimited reading. Perfect for learning. Would definitely recommend for other parents who want a tablet for their kids."
It is an excellent product.
I absolutely love this tablet way better than my iPad
Good product
"Awesome tablet.  I have a 2.5 year old Kindle Fire HD that I have used every single day since I got it. I am now hooked on the ability to change font size, brightness of display, etc and can't imagine ever reading another paper book. I started getting concerned about what I would do if my Kindle Fire died & was also on back order.  When I saw it on sale a while ago I decided to jump in and get it as a backup to my other Fire HD.  I am blown away by the changes and improvements so my old one has become my backup."
"Leaves a lot to be desired when you compare it to the iPad, but it does the job at an affordable price. The fact that it comes with advertisements (you have to pay to get rid of them) is rather annoying, though. Anyway, I returned this and got an iPad."
Love my new Kindle! Faster than my 2nd generation Kindle.  Only problem is my HOS game didn't transfer making me have to start over.
"For the price, a great tablet.  good value.  apple still better but at much greater cost."
works just fine
The kindle Fire HD 7 tablet is amazing. I absolutely love it and you sure can't beat the price. It has met all my expectations and then some. I'm finding it hard to put down. If asked I would not hesitate to recommend this tablet to any of my friends or family.
Nice upgrade to the original.
A little more complicated to use than my previous Kindle.
Love it.  Only wish i could use it outdoors.
Love it
Great
"the second time I tried to use it, it would not turn on or charge. I had to return it. I'm waiting on my refund so I can try to get it replaced."
Very satisfied haven't used it a lot as Grans have confiscated it 😍👍😍
"I have been flying frequently from coast to coast to see my sick father and didn't like lugging my laptop around so bought this to take with me. My teenage son kept telling me not to buy it. Well, he came with me on my trip last month (right after I purchased), and he renamed it and started saying &#34;where is my kindle&#34;. He really enjoys using it to watch show and stuff on it and play games. He downloaded a few movies and shows to a small external hard drive that he plugs into this. Battery lasts for hours! Happy with purchase."
"Still learning how to use my Fire HD, but so far so good and very happy with it."
"I have a regular-sized iPad, but I needed to have a 7&#34; tablet for a few particular times (not enough to justify $350 for an iPad Mini). I wanted to spend as little as possible but also go with a reputable name like Asus, Samsung, LG, etc. Fortunately, this one went on sale for $80 at just the right time.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1) I've used Android before, and knowing that the Kindle Fire is based on Android, I expected a user interface more like Android. The Fire, however, is completely its own animal. I mean, I knew Amazon had forked Android (&#34;Fire OS&#34;), but I didn't realize how dramatically different it was. Now, my experience has generally been with stock Android installations, so maybe Samsung or Asus does something completely unique as well. Personally, I think iOS has a better UI (both in general and for most of the apps I use). But since this isn't my &#34;regular&#34; tablet, I can live with Fire OS.<br /><br />2) One thing the Fire OS really does is make it easy to buy digital content from Amazon. That sounds a bit cynical, but if you're an Amazon fan, it's really a plus (especially if you're a Prime member). Apple has it's own ecosystem - with this, Amazon has one as well.<br /><br />3) Very good audio with the dual stereo speakers (one of the few things I like more about the Fire than the iPad, which has a mono single speaker, though you can get stereo with headphones).<br /><br />4) The display is nice. Not as sharp as &#34;retina&#34;, but the higher dpi makes up for it (I realize other Kindle Fires have a higher resolution, but remember, keeping the price as low as I could was the driver here).<br /><br />5) It's kind of heavy. Not bad, but a little weightier than I'd expected.<br /><br />6) The camera is crap, but I don't take pictures with my tablets. No one should take pictures with their tablets; you look silly.<br /><br />7) There's no SD slot, but unlike a previous Android tablet I used, you can actually copy files to the deviceitself. You can't really use Dropbox (which is what I use to copy stuff to my iPad), but you can use Amazon's Cloud Drive. The interface for that is web-based, but it's actually quite nice. Personally, I don't care if I'm using Dropbox or Amazon, the Cloud's the Cloud.<br /><br />8) I got the 8 GB model, of which you only get 4.5 GB for yourself, which is kind of lame. But I don't plan on being a heavy user of this, so I don't expect this to really be a problem.<br /><br />Overall, I like it. I'm not going to abandon my iPad for the Kindle, but I should get a decent amount of use out of it."
"Easy to carry around and maneuver . Camera is not good, and why can't they have a normal plug part to the USB ?"
"I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He hadn't been thinking about buying a tablet but he loves it so much it's pretty much won the title for BEST GIFT EVER.  That's a pretty difficult feat in our house. Anyway, he's been having a blast finding movies and old television shows to watch, surfing the web, checking in on facebook, and beefing up his library of e-books. He's absolutely delighted with everything he can do with it, and so I'm delighted at how much fun he's having with it."
"This thing is awesome! It's fast, lightweight, and fairly priced. Great device!"
So far so good
"Great Streaming video through Prime - took over 3 hours to download movie which was was fast of thre selections.  slowest was 720p, next was medium quality (what ever that is ) and the there was the fastest download. at who knows what quality.<br /><br />I think this is a scam still to make you buy the movie. Shame on you Amazon and Prime!!!!!!!!!"
Was a little hesitant at first to purchase this Kindle after my last two tablet purchases were a bust!  I have to say I am really enjoying it. Very well made with heavy duty materials.  The only thing I wish could be improved upon is the battery life (thus the 4 stars).  Couple this with the rooCASE (also sold on Amazon) and you'll find you just purchased an item you can travel with anywhere!
I am very pleased.  It's everything they said it was.  The price was right too.
It's not blue enough for me. It's darker than I expected.
Great job amazon as always!
"A great tablet. My wife loves it, easy to use and hold."
"This is my third 7&#34; Kindle Fire purchase. I started with the original Fire, then upgraded to the HDX 7&#34;. This fire lives in my office and is used primarily as a reader. I like the rear-facing camera and don't mind the slightly lower resolution of the screen compared to my HDX. I notice a slight speed difference, but not enough to really matter. I don't play games on it, so can't comment on that aspect, but I do use it for music, audio books, Facebook, etc. It's also used to put products onto Craigslist and Ebay. Of course, it's used to order products from Amazon.<br /><br />If Amazon had chosen to upgrade the HDX 7&#34;, I would probably have purchased that one instead of the HD for the added memory, but I'm satisfied with the HD for my needs.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent product for someone who is as deeply embedded in the Amazon universe as I am, providing a reasonable reading platform and other functions of adequate quality (camera, audio, etc.) for general use."
"This is a good little machine. It's a good reader, streams nice video, and for the price is a handy little item to have around."
"Love the size and the look.  Perfect for going anywhere.  Tv, computer, camera all in one.  Wonderful device.  Does it all."
"Just got my first ever Kindle.  I love it.  I needed a new reader so that i could... READ.  I also like to check my email & facebook.  It takes awhile figuring out how everything works since I've never had one so I have a bit of a learning curve right now but I'm excited to learn.  I've just added all my songs so I'm playing them to see how well they work.  The sound is great.  The ads (YES there are ads this comes with if you want the discount) don't bother me, you turn it on, see an ad then swipe to open the kindle & the ads go away till next time you let it sleep & open up again so if you are busy its not like the ads are popping up all the time.  You can add more than one email account (took  me awhile to figure this out), so that's great for checking my email.  I synced my music from my Windows 7 Home Premium Computer with drag & drop.  I got a warning that a device driver for Kindle was missing & it may not work right but I figured out the drag & drop to sync so so far so good.  It is slim & lightweight.  The battery will probably last a couple hours but turn your wi-fi off if you are not using it & it will last longer.  Took me just over 3 hours to charge up from 20% to 99% so that's not bad.  Leave it alone while charging, I was told the charger port could lose its connection if constantly pulled & jiggled, so if you leave it alone while charging & only pick it up to plug & unplug & don't yank your cord out you shouldn't have a problem with the port.  I ordered it last Friday & got it Tuesday (yesterday) with 2-day shipping with a free 30 day trial of Prime.  (2 business days) so that was great!  I will periodically try to make updates on this review, so that you can see how well its working for me or if I start to have problems.  5/26/2015 - I have had my Kindle about 2 weeks now.  I'm still enjoying it for the most part.  The battery life could be better.  It lasts about 8 hours so I've had to charge it daily.  I guess if I rarely used it then the time between recharging would be longer.  I am still trying to find apps that work for me & my personal preferences.  I have facebook, Olive Tree Bible app, several books, a game, lots of music.  Still trying to find a simple, easy to use note pad.  I think it would be great if the Kindle came with its own notepad, that would be a useful feature.  I had to purchase a 3.5 mm auxiliary cord to play my music in my car.  Although the kindle connected to my car's blue tooth it will not play my music.  I contacted my car manufacturer (Nissan) & they said it was not compatible with their blue tooth & to try an aux cord.  That works (although I think the cord is not great or perhaps was too cheap $6 because the sound goes in & out - but i don't believe its a kindle issue but rather the cord issue)  However after thinking about it , my kindle has dual speakers & I can just play my music straight from my kindle in my car & we can hear it good so you really don't have to have an aux cord.  I did take it outside to read, as long as you are not standing in direct sunlight the screen is visible enough to read (get in the shade somewhere).  October 11, 2015. Kindle still very useful, unlike many negative reviews I have dropped my kindle on carpet up to 3 feet at least and the screen has NOT cracked , with several added apps it has become sluggish but after removing them it works fine.  I guess I should just stick with sending emails, surfing the web, checking Facebook and using my preinstalled apps but I am still a happy customer."
Love it! The color is so beautiful!
Love it!
I am unimpressed. I had hoped to replace my iPad but this doesn't come even remotely close. It is just a way to check social media and read books all of which I can do on my phone and iPad. The only benefits so far is my cellphone battery lasts longer and the Kindle is easier to hold than my iPad. I would not have bought it or kept it except it was on sale.
I love mine and I'm trying to learn to navigate.
I'm really enjoying my Fire.  It does so many things!!!
Excellent
I've only had the tablet a short time but so far I like it fine.  I mostly read and handle my email and just entered my Facebook account.
Works well
i really like my Amazon Kindle Fire HD.Got for a Birthday present.I really wish for 2 things. 1- bring back Adobe Flash Player.2-Bring back payments on Amazon Prime.instead of paying it on one lump sum.The kindle is great and I do enjoy the excellent picture Quality on it.
The memory was stated as 8 Gb I downloaded 2 movies an got an message<br />not enough memory.<br />Checked the memory said 5 Gb 500 mb used left just got the kindle.....
"My Fire HD 7 is Fantastic  !!  The light behind the screen is perfect for reading. Great to access my e-mail, etc. etc. Each feature is Great -----the BEST Kindle I've ever had."
"Good tablet, my wife loves it"
I am very satisfied and pleased with the Fire HD 7. It is phenomenal!
Nice tablet.  We got it for Mothers Day for my Mom.  She likes it.
"It's fast, slick and great!!!!!!"
Took a little getting used to after the Kindle Fire but I really like the Fire HD 7.  Picture quality is quite good.  Better than my I-phone.
"I ordered it as a gift. It came with my name listed as owner, not my gift recipient, which made it difficult to makr it a personal iterm for her. we're trying  to seer how to overcome this problem."
"Compared to the Nexus7 it replaced, I can barely stand this thing.  It's battery life is laughably short.  It's keyboard is very slow to respond to typing commands.  It only runs a kind of bastardized version of Android and rooting it isn't possible.  It isn't synced with my phone because of this.  Google play store apps don't work, only amazon apps,  and there's nowhere near the selection.  I can't use Instagram for instance, and that's a pretty popular app.<br /><br />If it wasn't a gift, I would have sent it back, like the same day.  Even my GF who gave it to me hates using it.<br /><br />If you have an android phone, get an android tablet.  If you have an iPhone, get an iPad.  If you have low standards and self esteem, don't own a smartphone, and enjoy taking a charging cable every where, this is the tablet for you."
"I have yet to learn all that it can do, however I'm pleased to have made the plunge into the tablet world with this device. It's a good size that's relatively easy to hold. I am impressed with the versatility and the graphics. It's a convenient way to view my pdf documents as well as Kindle books and videos. The audio is mostly good; I'm hoping there is a way to boost the audio signal on some of my music...perhaps there's an app for that. I feel a bit clumsy with the scrolling and selecting, not having tiny fingertips, though there is likely a learning curve. Battery life seems decent. I find that it's easy to use up the internal storage; I suppose I'll have to learn to use the cloud storage option. I would recommend this device; the quality seems good for the price."
"I love it. Changing from apple tablets to fire. fast ,perfect picture ,performance perfect, incredible."
"I had to replace my first generation Kindle, reluctantly; but I'm really enjoying my new one.  It seems to respond faster and I will use the email feature this time--it is much more user-friendly.  There are some features I would like to change to be like my old Kindle, but if I can't, I will deal with it and learn the new!"
Great device.. Great deal..<br />A super quality product for the price..
I had no idea how great this device was.  I've had ipads for several years and had no idea the kindle fire was so compatible.
"I can log right on ~ I can check my mail , play my games , and check my f/book acct ............<br />love it ..... Later on will pick up more for my children"
love it!
"I like most aspects of the Kindle, however, I am finding it difficult to use some of the features and wonder about other things like how to delete something, how to program something and how to stop a command once I have started.  I'm sure that as soon as I get a bit more familiar with it and the on line instructions, I will do better.  I especially like it for nightime reading when my husband is asleep and I am not."
"I was very disappointed because I thought I had purchased it in pink!  It also works so differently from my original ones....it is taking quite a bit of getting used to.... have not gotten it to actually load my books on, I can only read when connected to the internet."
I am  enjoying my new kindle. Have had problems getting facebook and e-mail yet. need to solve that problem.
I had a Kindle fire but I always wanted the HD. I love everything about it.
The hd quality is great watching videos are so clear I love the sound quality. I was so excited when I saw it has video and you can take pictures while recording
Love it.
Your download app icons go blank sumtimes
"So far so good. Great picture quality and speaker sound. I do however have an issue with how downloading music is. It is very tedious to find what songs from pc to download, I wish it were a little easier to locate, like most tablets."
"I love this tablet. I love how it seamlessly connects with everything I do. I use amazon for everything, i order my school books, diapers, books, magazines. I have had a prime account for 4 years mainly for the two day shipping but now with the fire: videos, borrowing books, photo cloud, everything just works together perfect. If I am trying to do a few things at one time such as download a game and a book, while playing a game, my fire sticks and shuts off.. Now I did only pay $99 for this one, so the higher end fire may not do the same thing. The speakers are amazing!! it plays very loud, sound can be heard across the room. I watch videos all the time while cooking and I can hear the videos over the kitchen noise. it is something that I needed. Reading books with ease is another joy. the one problem with that is goodreads does not work, i keep getting update errors.... I love the carousal look where the last few things you did are right at your fingertips including my shows that I watch! I have used my share of tablets and I have to admit, for an amazon lover such as myself, adding a fire to it has made it perfect!"
Order two Kindles for my 2015 Christmas list.....great price.
This was given to me for mother's day mostly for reading. It's way better than my phone!
Well worth the price.
"My Kindle Fire had major problems, now it will not hold a charge, even tried other chargers,  cords to no avail. Less then two years old, warranty purchased, but not the extended warranty. ..expensive lesson!!!  Not happy with Amazon,  their tech support was of no help!"
"I love this tablet.  I am not a tablet pro, nor do I game or anything like that.  My husband bought me one so I don't have to take my laptop with me to stay on top of our VRBO rental via email.  The battery lasts FOREVER and I listen to audio books all the time.  Easy to respond to emails on the go.  Can watch hours of Netflix on the plane also.  Seriously, compared to my son's Nook battery, this one is amazing!  I also love the touch screen.  It is super sensitive, way better than the Nook once again, my son noticed that right away also.  Can't comment on the camera as I have a good one and don't need to complicate where my files are.  Very happy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
So far it is meeting my expectations. Size is just right and great colors. Very easy to use. Biggest con is the battery life. It seems to drain alot faster than I would expect.
the battery does not stay charged as described.
Nice product  fire runs smoothly and delivered on time thank you Amazon !
love this Kindle
"I am LOVING this!  It's my first tablet of any kind, and it's exactly what I've been holding out for.  It's small enough to put in my purse, but has a beautiful display.  The wi-fi capability makes it useful practically anywhere these days, and the battery seems to hold up well.  I am a commuting graduate student, and already a classmate was complaining about our text not being available through her iPad, but it's on Kindle for purchase.  Some text needs a hard copy, but for some books, this is a GREAT option-- one less book to carry!  I also like to travel with my fiance, and I used to have a carry on full of books and magazines and other entertainment items, and this will lighten up my carry on and bring everything to my fingertips, for the most part!  I also submitted a question to their support team within hours of owning it, and my inquiry was not only answered promptly and thoroughly, but with INCREDIBLE customer service.  I'm already a loyal Amazonian (that's what I call myself), but this entire experience has made me an even more enthusiastic customer.  &#60;3Amazon and my new Fire. :)"
When I first received the Kindle Fire HD it turned off several times as I was using it.  It haven't since and is everything I excepted. I loved my original Kindle Fire but not enough memory.
"I've used an iPad since the second generation, and even have a first generation iPad at this point. Both of those devices can be left on standby for days, if not weeks, and still have a charge when you turn them on. I can't even leave this device for a day not charging and have a charge! I've also had to restart the device more times than any other similar device I've owned. If I hadn't paid less than $100 for it after a special I honestly would return it. I guess you do get what you pay for!"
"I GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE LOVED IT!  HER CAR WAS BROKEN INTO AND  IT WAS STOLEN.  IS THERE A POSSIBILITY I COULD ORDER THE EXACT SAME THING AT $79?"
"The pictures are brighter, clear and the sound is outstanding !!"
Love the Fire!
Great device for the money. Has a few glitches.
"The new Fire HDs have no battery life. I tried 2 Fire hd 8.9s in March 2015 and had to return them. They do not stay charged overnight. I decided to try a Fire hd 7 a week ago and its the same problem. It goes dead overnight. Its ridiculous. I play a game for 1 hour, turn it off, and its dead in the morning. Do not buy any Fire hd unless you want to keep it plugged in 24/7.  My Fire hd 7 from over 2 years ago keeps a charge for a week.  These new versions suck."
"I bought it one month before you dropped the price,  what more do you expect?"
So nice and clear and easy to use!
Battery life is terrible. Just surfing the web for about 45 minutes and lost 50% of my battery life. Had I known I probably wouldn't have purchased.
The &#34;Special Offers&#34; 'feature' is pretty frustrating.
Little heavy for tablet and thick but screen is good
You have to recharge it everyday.
I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. This is the third kindle in the family.
Coming from an original fire the build quality is a lot cheaper. First day I got it watched a movie from prime and the thing froze making a loud humming vibrating noise; had to hard reset. Screen is a lot nicer than previous models and os is very simple.
Could have been a 5 * but the connector for charging was not included as promised so I can not<br />charge it using electric outlet.
I SO love my new Kindle Fire! It's the perfect size and it does so much. Can't go wrong with it!
I LOVE MY KINDLE HD7!!!
"Battery did not last, even with light use. Returned for refund."
It's just wonderful!
My learning curve was not as easy as the Galaxy but I have been able to download some of my favorites. Pictures work better because of the cloud. I like how the local paper comes in. ( Better tah the Galaxy). It is really too early in my learning curve to give a fair and just assessment.<br />I will use it but I am able to store apointment on the galaxy I will eventually be able to on this.
It is good for what I got it for.  It also has a lot of extras that are very nice and convenient.
This is my 3rd Kindle and it's just getting better and better!  Wahoo!
"I love everything I can do with it. I thought it was mostly just for reading books, but boy was I wrong! I haven't used my laptop hardly at all since last week and it's so portable."
Love it!  It meets all my expectations!
"The Fire HD 7 is a pretty good little tablet, especially for the price.  If you are buying this to read books, do very light internet browsing and/or listen to audiobooks, consider my rating 5 stars.  However, if you are looking for something like a bigger version of your Android phone, look elsewhere.  The primary reason for only 3 stars (and why i returned it) is b/c you are very much forced to remain primarily within the Amazon world (and again, if that's what you want, 5 stars).  You cannot install or gain access to Google Play Services in anyway so if you wanted to play clash of clans or get any of your other Android apps (that aren't in Amazon's AppStore), you can't. Some apps can be sideloaded but even then, you can't load your backed up data from Google.  Also, much to my dismay, there is currently no Root method available so you can't use a different app launcher (i could not stand the Fire's interface) or install alternate versions of Android.  Honestly if i could root this thing, I would have given it 5 stars."
Amazon you've done it again! I love this device.  Awesome! Arrived earlier than expected. Packaged nicely in the Amazon box. I'm so excited. Thank you!
"Except for the money to replace our stolen Fire, this was a GREAT GREAT DEAL!!!!  Sweetie Pie is soooooo happy now....and thats all that matters.  Even the roocase we bought for this Fire was the bomb.  HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY,  as Phil Robertson says :)"
"Love it except for the advertising on the main screen. I understand it's purpose to make the item cheaper for me, but I would have liked to know in advance before purchasing and having to google how to get rid of the ads. Overall works great though to stream."
I did not find this Fire HD user friendly.  I may return it.
"It's killer.  And for the sale price of $79 bucks, how could you possibly go wrong?<br />Get it and be happy (it's a simple pleasure that works smoothly)."
Love it!
Great device
Having a blast with it.  Does everything they said it would.
"I love it! As an Amazon Prime subscriber, this device really helps me make the most out of it. The picture quality is beautiful and the system is fast. I'm still learning many of the features but I can definitely read, browse the internet and watch videos easily on the device."
Easy to use!  Love everything about it!
Operating system takes getting used to due to moving from Apple Iphones. Works nicely otherwise.
"I ABSOLUTELY love it!  Extremely smooth running, fun to use, and amazing for the price!  Amazon really one heck if a product here.  Keep up the great work Amazon!  This Fire is amazing."
Very please with my HDFire
Terrible.  You must be directly in front of the screen.  It serves as a radio in the kitchen.  That is it.
It is great...
I have just started to use the fire hd and am now getting use to it. Having a kindle before has helped but I need a bit of time
"Poor wireless card, poor battery life. I returned it"
Great product. Was hoping to be able to use Skype since this one has a camera. Over all fast clear answer vivid color
Love it.  Easy to use and very friendly.  Sound and pictures are superb.
"I'm finding it about what I expected but having to now learn a third system is a little difficult particularly without any useable instructions book.  Ive tried two and both are  just repeats of just the very basic, no help"
nice but confusing to
I give this tablet 5 stars it is really super
My daughter love it
Nice but does not support all the apps I use
"Though I hate the carousel, the price was more than reasonable for the product.  It's fast, it has two cameras, and it is a great product to use for travel capacities."
Very pleased with it.  Just wish it was where I could add a data package to it.
I love it!
I love my new kindle fire.
"I love the improvements on the new Kindle Fire. Email functions much better than the original Fire. Also the keyboard letters are further apart and I don't overlap hitting more than one letter like I did on the last one.<br />I like that all my books, apps, and contacts were saved in the cloud or came over automatically from the previous Kindle. I had no trouble activating or getting started with the new one.<br />My one complaint is the location of the power button and the charging port are not in a good location. When I put the cover on it, the elastic band covers them.<br />Also, the camera cannot function with the cover on since it covers the lens. I don't think, however, that the picture quality is very good."
"It arrived on a Sunday, as the agent said. Very satisfied. It just doesn't save the accomplishments with your games, as this was a replacement. Everything was on my kindle.<br />Thanks,<br />Maddy"
Happy with my new toy.Fran. donovan
Bought it for my my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.  She loves it.  The price is outstanding.
My dad and I love our Kindles! Can someone let us know if we can borrow each other's ebooks? I've tried finding ones that he owns in the lending library and he has tried finding some of mine to no avail. Thanks to anyone that can answer our question!
I love this thing! Perfect for watching my Amazon Prime movies!
"Wi Fi would not connect to my internet nor couldn't use. Sent back. Others like it real well, not good for me."
"I bought this as a mother's day gift for my mother-in-law. it is excellent. added the twc app so she can watch tv while in the kitchen, skype to talk to her grandkids and tunin radio to listen to her favorite radio stations from around the globe."
"Use it mostly as a reader, but love the capability of it to do so much more.. Been with Kindle from the beginning."
Love it!
I love my kindle. It is perfect for doing the things I enjoy
Bought this for my grandkids to use at my house .....excellant product and serve the purpose
Great product. But too much glare on the screen
"Nice, not much different from my old kindle fire hd. I had read that I could fling whatever is on my kindle to my tv. If so I can't figure it out."
This is my second Kindle fire and I love it. I had the original and decided to upgrade to the latest version. This one includes the ads and I don't really see an issue with them at all. It was worth the savings.
"I didn't realize that I wanted a tablet of any kind until I got this! I love it, it's awesome & seems to work great so far. If I had one negative thing to say, it would be the battery life doesn't seem to last long. But I'm sure it depends on what you're doing. I would recommend this to anyone."
"i have been using the fire 7 hd for 2 weeks and have not had any issues, everything loads normal, my daughter uses it sometimes for games and parental control is very helpful, easy to use, highly recommend for adults of kids."
I was patiently awaiting to purchase this Kindle Fire HD to replace my older Kindle.  Amazon had printed that a new shipment was due on May 14th.  Imagine my surprise today when I logged on and saw that Amazon had them back in stock WITH A 40% INCREASE in price!
Love it!
Great tablet
Love the Kindle Fire
Like the size. Easy to carry when traveling. This is my second Kindle.
"Love it.  Perfect size, no fuss setting up and adding on my social media accounts,  Although this is advertised as a tough little toy when dropped - I'm going to get it a cover, just in case.  And it came early - in time for Mother's Day - so we spent the day in the hammock in the backyard getting acquainted."
"I am not sure what I am rating, but Amazon usually has it all together!"
So far it has been great. Still figuring some things out.
"A slight improvement to my Kindle Fire HD 2013 - &#34;slight&#34; only because my 2013 model is absolutely fabulous, so there wasn't much room to improve. But - the improvements are: For a fantastic sales price I got a Kindle Fire with a camera, which my 2013 model doesn't have, for a small price difference I have 16 GB now instead of 8, and the greatest improvement - the sound! As other reviewers stated, the sound of those little speakers is fantastic - great for watching movies or listening to music. This is the only tablet I will ever need. No need for a pricey i-anything."
"This was received as a gift. I have not had a Fire as of yet, so I was really surprised and happy. So far I love it, pretty easy to operate, and easy to load apps. I would recommend one of these to anyone, what a great way to still surf the net to shop and follow family and friends."
I love the size and how light weight it is. Wishing it has the auto brightness though. Wishing it has a little more aesthetically  pleasing buttons
"This is our second Kindle Fire.  We have the original Fire HD 7, and this one is smaller and more sleek.  We also purchased a matching case in the Cobalt blue.  With the cloud storage I was able to pull all my apps off the original Fire and download them on the new one.  Made life easier.  Would highly recommend for anyone who likes to browse the internet, read e books, watch youtube videos, etc."
I am very pleased with my Fire HD 7.  I already owned a Kindle Fire and the HD 7 was a natural progression.  It is very user-friendly and easy to set up.  I would recommend it to anyone.
I absolutely love it.....
I love the product but don't like the fact that there are no instructions included with it.
Great ...so sharp and clear.
I love it.  Arrived as promised. Condition perfect. Fire HD 7 is easy to use and does more than just a tablet.
Love my new kindle ordered at 10a.m.Thursday and got it on Friday by 3p.m.  Unbelievable.  Battery lasts very long and ample storage for a lot of music and books I've downloaded to device.
"Just remember that I'm judging this tablet as a budget tablet not a super expensive powerhouse. If you want a powerhouse that can do everything, I suggest an iPad, Nexus, or one of the more powerful Samsung tablets. There are a few bugs but they wouldn't make me not by it. This tablet is a great deal and I would recommend this to almost anyone looking for a great tablet with a low price tag. I would buy again and probably will buy more Amazon devices in the future (I'm hoping that they come out with a smartwatch 😁). P.S. I got this $60 off so that made it an even better deal. 👏👏👏"
"I love the fire HD, this is the 3rd one I've bought."
"Received as a gift, what a wonderful surprise."
Love it still learning all that it does
Absolutely beyond my expectations! I'm so glad I chose the Kindle versus the iPad!
Husband got it for me as a gift. I love to read. All my books transfer for my othet kindel apps. Love the size. Works great .
"I was playing a game this morning and it came on my screen and said my battery was low and that it was bad, but my battery was saying 92 percent charged, is there a problem"
"excellent product, so far zero problems. Great screen, and this unit is fast. Nice upgrade from original fire"
Received in good time and works great<br />great
"I have had 3 Kindles, all of which have quit working conveniently after the year warranty was up.  All three have had issues with charging.  They quit working and no longer hold a charge no matter how long they are plugged in.  I am HIGHLY dissatisfed with Amazon's customer service and the quality of their product.  I would NEVER reccommend a Kindle to anyone.  I will be purchasing an iPad; at least I know Apple products continue to work for longer than a year."
I love my new HD Kindle Fire 7. I wore out my 6 after 3 years of daily use.  I loved it as well.
"Really enjoying it, my old one was slow, so this is great and I love the magenta color. Nice to have a camera too,still learning new things with it."
Am purchasing one for #1 son after #2 son gave me one for Xmas. Do recommend getting a stylus. Greasy fingerprints are not fun. This is a great buy!
"The kindle fire HD is an excellent device. The screen in clear and easy to read. The wifi works well, if not exceptionally quickly. The colors make it easier to read and better to look at. It synchronized the books and bookmarks as soon as a wifi connection was established, making it very easy to transition to it from a regular kindle. As for cons, the whole device is a lot heavier than the plain kindle, so holding it for long periods of time while reading is a little more of a strain. The world of mobile devices doesn't accomodate the kindle like it does the Ipad and the various android devices, so you could find some limitations you weren't expecting. For instance, Alaska Airlines has a mobile app to watch their entertainment on it's flights. There is no app for the kindle, just the ipad and android tablets. Overall though, I like it, especially at the special price."
New
Battery dries so quickly.would never recommend it to anyone.
so far so good.
I love this tablet because when bought it it made me feel happy
Bought this one to replace an old one.  Wish I could have retrieved the old games and books.  There was a email address change and I lost all the old data.
I love the Kindle
"I love it still learning how to use it (not hard at all) I have a kindle reader which I liked but it didn't light up the pages , so this is great for reading and so much more."
"My new Kindle Fire 7 HD is great! I really needed a new one, my old one wasn't working to well. I'm still playing around with it but I can't wait to read a good novel on it. All smiles over here!"
The best tablet if you don't mind being attached wifi all the time or use very expensive mobile data. 80% of the app and games can't run without wifi so when there isn't any additional storage options not too much entertainment can go on.
"Sturdy, reliable my 3rd Kindle"
"I had no idea how powerful the Kindle Fire is until my daughter gave it to me.  I thought it was only a reader but you can access the web, do email and Facebook, take pictures and so much more. Glad I didn't get an IPad that would have cost so much more for the same capabilities."
All I use this for is reading my Kindle Unlimited and Goodreads books.  It's perfect.  A little hard to figure out how to put icons on my home page and surfing isn't as simple either but it all balances out.  The main thing I need it for is excellent!!
"The ease for reading on this new Kindle is fantastic.  I love the library showing all the books in there.  There are so many things that shine on this little thing that makes it seem bigger than it is.  If I had to say what isn't as great let me first say this; I've been used to the paper white for 4 years and so reading outside was no problem.  With this Kindle you can't read out in the bright light so for that I'm keeping my paper white kindle.  I love how these two sync with each other to make it easy to go from one book to the next device.  I also love how this one is so easy to read at night.  You can adjust the light so it won't be too bright at night.  No more attaching a book light to it.<br />I'm not familiar with playing games but for my grandson I'm going to have to learn.  There is a lot to learn about downloading games and playing them.  Luckily I don't have to teach him to play but I did need to set the parental controls to make sure he (5 yrs) doesn't accidentally buy extras during the games.  Had to learn that.  Also I'm not used to the battery dying so quickly...about every 3 days.  So for these simple little reading issues I'm keeping the Kindle paper white to use also.  If most of you don't have one let me just say for all it's lack of color, it's the best reader ever.  Still, I love this Kindle Fire HD 7.  I'm glad I have both."
Good product.
I love my original Kindle Fire and I like my new HD7. I will love it also I'm sure when I learn more how to navigate. I do love the new camera and other options that comes with it.<br />Julia
wooks as expected
I love this tablet so much.  It's great.  Can't say enough about it.  Highly Recommend it.
This is my 5th Kindle Fire!
"I am very disappointed that an 8 GB model actually has 4.5 GB available to the user, and that the 16 GB has only 11.5 GB available. It just seems terribly dishonest to me that Amazon calls these 8GB and 16GB. In my book that is called lying. I guess that I'll be deleting stuff often as I got the &#34;8&#34;GB model.  I'll be surprised if they approve this review, but I just had to share if I can. This is a dishonest policy! BOO!!, HISS!!! I guess that's business though."
love it
Excellent product. Compares favorably with my iPad.
No sir I do not like it. Its stops working sometimes and need hard reset. The volume is poor like the iPad... You have learn how to maneuver the buttons positions to actually start liking it. Did not bring anything for free.. I mean nothing.<br /> This thing is tough and feels right on the hands. Crystal clear movies and a books... Lol that's about it... This is not made for games movies it crashes. This was made for shopping and navigating websites
Awesome!
"The Fire is just what I needed for my wife. She is disabled and reading is a big part of her life. She is getting to know how to use it, the only complaint she has is it doesn't feel like a book but she is loving it."
I was very pleased with my new Kindle. One problem is that I have to keep recharging the battery it does not want to last long.
"Love, love my new fire.  With my prime membership I was able to have shows to watch on a recent trip that I could watch without internet and then not feel bad when I deleted them because I had not paid a fortune for them.<br /><br />The screen is so clear and easy to read any time of day or night."
Product was delivered as expected
"I recently purchased a KindleFire HD7.  I purchased it mostly because of the advertising that states that it is rugged and can be thrown on the ground without worry.  Today, I noticed my screen is cracked.  I am a retired senior citizen and really have given up throwing things around.  I am very careful with my thing and I am now very disappointed with this device and do not recommend it if you are buying it because you think that it is rugged.  I have had an I-Pad or 2 years and had no problems with breakage."
Works good. Could have more personalization options
Kindle goes everywhere with me  one of my best buys ever
Great love useing it
Quick delivery. Had a 2011. Love the upgrades.
"The 16GB is definitely the way to go-I bought the 8GB for my daughter and we were constantly having to delete things, or download them to the home pc so that she could add new apps, or even take pictures and save them."
"This tablet is a great deal, works well. My only caution is that I have already paid for some games, but those games have a kindle version which is not part of the original purchased game so I would have to purchase them again."
Boughts the fire for my wife and she loves it!  We have always read at bedtime and now she can read with the light out!
Outstanding reader and small tablet. Very good resolution to picture and love the backlit screen. Battery life good as long as I keep the WiFi turned off. Highly recommend this as a reader and as a first tablet.
"This is my second, maybe third Fire HD.  Along that ownership path I have experienced many improvements. This recent purchase of the Fire HD, is my last.  It's a keeper."
Does the job good. Perfect size for me.
"1st one ever ordered. Got it as a gift for my wife. She had it for 2 weeks with little use. One day (last day of the 2 weeks) the display screen just went blank. It was charged and would make noises, but no visual. Amazon was great on sending a replacement. If you do order this be sure to get the extended warranty/coverage."
Wish I could have custom backgrounds but for the price this is a fantastic product
This is my First Reader.. It's so much more.. I can check my email surf the web and shop and send email and so much more.. What a sale.. Glad I have one..
"It is much faster than my older Kindle, but battery life does not last 8-10 hours as advertised.  Overall I really enjoy it."
"First time owning a mobile device other than a dumb cell phone.  It is nice if I can get a wifi signal.  Bummer that I can't get Google Store apps as the ones that Amazon offers are crap.  Great picture quality though.  Still trying it out, may change my mind at some point in the future."
"It does all the functions that you expect a table to do, Netflix and Youtube videos are clear. The tablet is made to entertain you through Amazon Instant video, Kindle, Prime Music, Pandora, Facebook, and Games. It is a great buy"
Such an improvement over the original fire! I love it!
"I love it. Screen needs to be readable outside , no glare"
My husband loves his new kindle
"I have the iPad Air as my main tablet, but at $75, I couldn't pass this up.  I use it mostly in the kitchen for recipes and streaming music to my bluetooth speakers, and it works very well."
Fun and easy to use.  Great for reading.
This tablet/reader is perfect. It is very light weight and the pictures are vibrant. Battery life is good.
Love my kindle
It meets my every need. Love the fact that it has a camera and also appreciate the smaller size.
"I love my Fire HD.<br />I love The Cloud on my Fire HD!!my books, my music all in The Cloud."
I love my Kindle. Perfext size for reading books and not too big and heavy. I take it with me wherever I go and always have my books at hand!
Great product!
Still having problems with it. Can't do what I wanted to do with it??<br />Maybe I need lessons??
Love it!  Never leave home without my Kindle.
"I wanted an e-reader that could do some light web surfing, e-mail checking, etc. and this fits the bill.  Not too heavy, fits well in your hands.  If you like the auto-wake/sleep function, it works based on the case, not the device itself. I got an incompatible case and have to hit the power button to turn off and on. One other issue is that I use the Zinio App to read magazines, although I was able to get it installed through the Zinio.com website, the app was not in the Amazon App Store. Would have made it so much easier."
"When I bought this, I expected to have a mixed experience, because of the lack of support for apps from the Google play store. I was mistaken. I have thoroughly enjoyed using this tablet. I have begun to use it more than even my android phone! I have encountered the bug that causes the device to not be able to connect to WiFi, and have had to factory reset my device a total of 3 times in the past 2 weeks. That hasn't been too big of a deal, though, because I use the backup feature built into the device. Overall, this tablet has been one of the best devices I have owned!<br /><br />If you have been looking for specs on this device (like I was), this device seems to have a Snapdragon 400 series (I believe it's a 410 on my model) quad core processor (1.2 GHz for 2 of the cores, and 1.5 GHz for the other 2), and 1GB of RAM. The other specs seem to be consistent when you search on Google.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cheap tablet that is well built, and don't mind not having all of the apps from the Google play store, then this is a fantastic choice! If you are unsure about this device (or any of the tablets/phones offered by Amazon), then please do some research in the Amazon app store for your favorite apps, the hardware specs, and run searches online for reviews that talk about what you want the device for.<br /><br />Would have given 5 stars if the WiFi bug was fixed. Amazon, that is a DEVICE-BREAKING issue! Please address this before people lose faith in your products, and in you! This issue has been found across ALL of your devices, from what I have read on other sites and reviews of your other products, which makes it hard to justify buying any of your other devices for now."
Great have as extra tablet when kids come over!
"Absolutely, wonderful!"
"So far  it is great,  I am still learning about it. How to operate it. It all  takes time."
I love my kindle
Awesome
keeps freezing up. disappointed.headed for one month now its dead and nobody is willing to help don't recommend this
I still have Not figured out How to take a photo.  I really wish y'all would send a &#34;How To&#34; with the device.
Nice small tablet to carry around. Sound and Picture video quality is really good.
"When you purchase a device that advertises as having 8 gig storage, you kind of expect close to 8 gig available storage, not the 4.5 gig they finally tell you is available after several calls to support.<br />The official story from their tech support: a little under half of the 8 gig is used up by system files and apps required for your kindle to operate and these files cannot be deleted. So - your &#34;8gig&#34; device is actually 4 gig!<br /><br />By the way - no one in support could explain to me why,  after already taking up half the space for system files, there was an additional 650 meg locked up on my half listed as 'system'.<br />So - to recap - if you purchase an 8 gig Kindle Fire - you better be expecting 3 gigs available for you to use!!"
My wife loves it
"Had it for a week or so, been great.  It's very responsive, and the FreeTime app is great for my daughter.  It'd be nice if it had an SD card slot to add storage space."
"ordered for my daughter,  she  says its hard to navigate.  but im sure with time she will get It down."
Love it!!!
Still getting to know it but I like it very much so far.
Crystal clear HD and very easy to use. I love that my family can share our purchases on multiple devices.
"Why am I writing this review 5 months after the purchase? That's how long it took for the Fire to stop working. My cheap Nook knock-off has lasted longer. I have to say: I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase and can say with no hesitation that if this is how Amazon's electronics are then I am glad I made the decision against Fire TV and phone. The setup is counterintuitive. The child profiles are hard to manage. The browser is second rate. I think I'd rather just buy another better tablet in the future. On a positive note, I'm happy to say the tablet worked well with our Wifi and the display is crisp. On a separate negative note, there are ads on screen literally every time you turn the device on. Overall, I would recommend to pay a little extra for better quality."
So far no problem. Hope that it lasts longer than my last fire did.
"Ok, how do I get to numbers when typing."
Excellent value and capabilities.  Amazon continues to impress.
Very handy device. Great for catching up on shows and movies.  Sound is better than I thought it would be.
I miss my Nook...
Very happy with my purchase and very prompt delivery.
"My Fire HD 7, 16GB is amazing, reliable, fast and versital! I can use it for the internet (Wi-Fi), reading books, Facebook, e-mail, and playing games. There are so many free apps to choose from. It is just the right size for reading and carrying in my pocketbook."
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. Once Amazon replaced the original charger which didn't work, my husband has loved,it. His only complaint has been all the pop,up,ads. Would love to know how to get rid of them."
"Excellent tablet with a few features that I am not familiar with, so I have more to learn. I received my Kindle late Friday and I have used it since. Lighter weight, front and rear facing camera etc. I'm a Happy Customer."
"Have been wanting my Fire HD for a while. Now that I have it, I cannot put it down.Still looking for certain apps. However it is a great purchase.  Love it!"
Great product!!!
"Amazing video clarity ! Very fast between pages! THE bargain in 7in. tablets. I had a 7 in. fire tablet for 3 years that still looks and functions like new even though I took it to the gym 5 days a week, so now my grand kids are having a ton of fun with it. The Fire HD is a huge leap forward in capabilities even though the price is about the same as the old tablet was ! You can pay more but WHY ?"
Don't like as much as 2nd generation.
I love it. The color is awesome!
Still learning how to use it.  I can't complain since it is only $99.
This was an early birthday present for my boyfriend. very easy to set up and this is being used daily for gaming!!  He loves it!
Excellent tablet for the price.
I upgraded from an original Kindle Fire and I am so pleased that I did. This new Fire HD 7 has new features such as cameras and performs even better than the original
took too long to get male voice reader. Apps are hard to find. Getting books from cloud to device is next to impossible.
As with most Kindle products there is little room for criticism.  The technology is amazing.  This is my 3rd and the only possible complaint would be battery life.
"Very nice tablet, works wonderfully!"
"A few reasons why I am giving the Fire HD 7 4 stars instead of 5. 1st reason is it isn't a typical Google based Android tablet, so if you want any apps or games from the Google Play Store you will need to install some other app so you can use the google apps. 1Mobile Market app seems to be a good app for Google apps to be working on my Fire HD 7 so far. Of course I only had a few games & apps I wanted to use that Amazon did not offer on their app store so I have no idea how well it will work with a lot of other Google apps. Also, make sure you go into the settings & allow non Amazon apps to be installed.<br />I have noticed a few apps in the Amazon app store won't work properly. The companies that make these apps need to update them or something... Biggest disappointments are Dish Anywhere app not working on the Fire HD 7 & Starz Play app not having my TV satellite provider. Hoping these companies can address these issues.<br />Now for the other problem I have with the Fire HD 7. Parental controls... Some apps I have downloaded I can not allow my children to play. Won't even give me the option to allow them to play. I love the fact the Fire HD can be set up with multiple profiles. No need to go out & buy a tablet for every member of the house now. Still I wish I had a little more control over the parental controls. Such as allowing my kids to do a search in the app store but with restrictions on spending through my Amazon account. If there is a way for them to look for games on their own profile I have not figured it out which would means it is to difficult & needs to be made easier. Instead I have to sign into my profile & let them browse the app store to find the games or apps they want to play with. IF there is a way for my children to browse & download apps & games on their own profile someone needs to inform me of how this is done. It would be nice if I could allow the app store to be selected for in the parental controls so I can allow one child but not the other.<br />Battery life seems a little bit on the weak side. Seems it drains pretty fast compared to some of the other tablets I have had for my kids. battery life could be better but I guess it isn't terribly bad. One last thing, the cameras. The pictures I have taken were grainy looking. Of course the rear facing camera takes a better picture I would have hoped for a better picture & the front facing camera is really low quality in my opinion. Of course I don't take a lot of pictures with my tablet so this is not a huge problem as it is with my kids who take pictures of everything.<br />Overall I am satisfied with the Fire HD 7. My true rating would be a 4.5 out of 5 stars."
So far so good....booting up was very easy and clarity is exceptional. Have already downloaded games. Now going to download books and later on movies.
Turn it on & use it - it's that easy
"I love my HD 7, HD Display WI-FI, 8gb."
"Bought this for my 89YO mom so she can keep up with family photos on Facebook. There is a learning curve for her, but only because of her age. The device is fine. It certainly compares to an iPad, for a much better price. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one for myself when my iPad dies. Mother loves seeing pictures of the kiddos. I may load some books on it too. She loves to read. Baby steps...."
Only issue i have is removing things from cloud
so far I am loving my Kindle
I enjoy the new version i also have the fiest kindle this is awesome
So far I am enjoying the kindle fire. It's great for my 3 year old granddaughter and I like the way it syncs to my other kindle
"Easy to read and takes great pictures.  I haven't been able to get my info (contacts, photos,) from my cell phone to my kindle.  I,m not great on technology. Some easy help would be appreciated."
okay
Awesome! Even better than my original Fire!
Trouble connecting to Bluetooth and turning the unit on. Disappointed
"I am really struggling with this tablet. It won't allow me to do much. It is slow. It shuts itself down more often than not. It will not allow me to download anything, but yet it doesn't have any type of flash player, necessary to view certain websites. It's very frustrating."
Excellent
claims to be android backed but they only have select android apps<br />this would be a great product if it was fully open to the android platform and you could get to Google apps and forms wasted my money.
I ordered in magenta got a black one not happy
I love the kindle.  Its just the perfect size for putting in my purse to always go with me.  Its light enough that it doesn't hurt my wrists holding it for hours on end as I slowly work my way through the 1000+ books I have for my kindle.  I also love a lot of the other functions of it so I can do facebook and my mail and The video screen is awesome for watching movies.  And it hooks up to my blue tooth speakers so I can watch the movies and have the volumn loud enough  to hear it through the speakers. And the battery seems to last a very long time even with constantly being used day after day. This was a very good buy
"This is the 4th Kindle I have purchased very satisfied. Sleek,fast, great apps, great size"
Changed from a Nook to the Fire HD. Bigger screen makes it easier to view games and movies. Fantastic picture!
Excellent.
"I was very sad, my first kindle fire was done in after 3 1/2 years. I was not ready to let go but needed to replace it. Anything I would have wanted to have updated was done to this new model. Took a bit of transition but I am totally into this device and all it does. My husband's first gen. fire is still going strong but he sees his future with kindle fire and it looks great!"
"Meets all my expectations for video, reading, exploration. Convenient and just the right size for travel. Great price,also."
"Received the new Fire HD 7.  While my 2 yr old Fire HD 7 was working just fine, I like the new one.  It's faster,has front and back facing cameras, and its magenta color should make it easy to find.  Also, it shipped 2 weeks earlier than I expected."
"I'm really enjoying my new Kindle Fire HD. It's light, fast and the colors are fabulous."
"I love this Kindle Fire.  Set up quickly to home WiFi. Great for checking email, reading books, and the camera is an added bonus.  For the extra special price I paid for it - $79, no complaints at all."
"I have a solitaire game on the kindle, and it periodically freezes, and I have to shut it down completely in order get it to work again; very frustrating. I haven't tried my other games yet. But no problem streaming  a movie."
Love the device<br /> Syncs perfectly with my kindle reader.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the length of the charging cord.  There is chair in my house that close to an outlet.  I have to be a contortionist to use it while plugged in.  My kindle reader has a cord that is about<br />2 feet longer. Makes a huge difference.
Love it!
"Functions well, but the case is very slick, unlike the HDX.  But very nice picture."
"I have a 2nd generation Fire HD, and now this 4th generation.  I have to say that I love that it has a forward-facing camera.  However, the operating system on this one is terrible.  It's difficult to do the simplest task, such as turning the volume up and down - you have to go into Settings, Device Settings, etc, rather than just being in the toolbar at the top like the older version."
"Bought this for my mom, she loves it."
This is a great device.  Just like a laptop at a tenth of the cost.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Easy to carry and very functional.  Especially if traveling!
I have not had my kindle long but it is close to my expectations. The only difficulty is that the battery charge doesn't last as long as expected. But other than that I am satisfied with my purchase.
This tablet is Awesome. The best I've ever seen!
Perfect
"I love my Fire HD, but there are some features on my old Fire that were more convenient."
I am very happy with this purchase.  It is amazing.
I find that the Kindle Fire doesn't keep its charge very long. No big deal but it goes through the battery fast.  I don't like that every time you log on the Amazon promotional offers are constantly popping up and you have to swipe right past them.  Those are the only complaints that I have so far. I would recommend this item.  The resolution quality is awesome and technology abilities are great. Highly recommend. Hope I remember to cancel my 30-day $99 Amazon Prime membership that you HAVE to sign up for to get started using your Kindle Fire.
My 2nd Kindle.  &#34;Hope I don't need to buy a New One every few years because of charging issues. Hope They finally figured it out.&#34;
I love it I also have the fire and HDX but this has a front and back camera which I really love. There is so much I can do I am told.  I just have to learn and it is very forgiving.
"After buying a brand new Fire HD for my wife as a present, the tablet only lasted about a month before my wife had issues with the device holding a charge and just didn't work. We were more than happy to have exchanged the tablet for another brand new tablet (what I paid for), they only wanted to send us a refurbished one. This was completely unacceptable considering I paid for a new one which ended up not working and that was the only option they gave us. We gladly sent it back and asked for our money back. Never again."
"This is an awesome Kindle.  All my books were automatically loaded and it runs like a charm for Facebook, E-Bay or Utube.<br />I get my gmail in a snap.  Love to stay connected to Amazon games and purchasing.  This is my third Kindle and the best upgrade yet.<br />Even has a camera.  I-pad has nothing that this tablet can't do and the price is within most people's budget.  Love it and love Amazon.<br />And, most apps are free!"
Love it!
"I haven't been able to learn how to use it yet, as using a tablet is new to me.  I will need more time to work with it, or get someone to help me learn how to use it."
I've been having fun with it.
"Easy to use, light weight and size adequate, small enough to fit into a small purse."
Love it!
works as good as its advertised
Kindle Fire was everything I expected.  Easy setup and functions well.  Would have raited a five but Still like my IPAD for reading books better.
It got locked up on me when trying to look up another user on my account
It is all I wanted
"The tablet arrived in two days, free shipping, as promised.  To my wonderful surprise, it was delivered early enough for me to take it to my granddaughter.  She loves it!  A very happy customer."
I am extremely pleased!!!
very resilient and the resolution is spectacular
Great tablet for the price.
Great for books. Wifi connection makes browsing the web iffy and I think the available web browser is kind of crappy. I often encounter moments where I use the browser and it fails to load pages repeatedly. After a few minutes and a retry the page loads fine. May be due to the power saving option that disables wifi when you aren't using it.
"I've been using the Kindle to read, play a few games,"
Love my Kendle!  A tablet even a senior citizen can use. Still learning and having fun in the process!
I like it it is clear its not as free as I thought almost everything cost money.
"My favorite feature is profiles. I can set my kids limits on everything. Reading, movies ad games seperately. I can also set a time limit that they have to read before they can play or watch movies.<br />And they are pretty tough, my friend has an older one and I watched her son drop it from the top of the stairs and not a dent, my galaxy tab3 would have shattered. I haven't tested this though, nor have my kids.<br />Defintely worth the full price or the discount. Does everything other tablets do. Though, Amazon has great apps for those tablets. I like that my account is in sync with my Amazon prime account. Makes it easier to order anything (movies, music, books anything else). You can lock the ordering too so you don't have to worry about unwanted purchases, just impulse buys :)."
"So easy to use! Perfect for me and my family. Take it to bed to watch tv, play games or download FREE audio books! I love it!"
"Love my new Fire HD 7 I'm sorry that I didn't buy it sooner. So many free apps to choose, the color is wonderful and<br />the screen size if perfect for me.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Betty"
Great picture quality! Wish there was an unlimited Internet plan just for the fire.
nicer than I thought it would be. it has a louder sound than my a fire hdx  and I also like the rear and front facing cameras  . I love both models
It would have gotten 5 stars if it came with an instruction book. I would love to see what all my Kindle will do.
Fantastic buy. Runs smooth and easy to use.
What a beautiful purchase!! I absolutely LOVE my fire!!
Excellent item.
This model will NOT screen mirror. It's a good kids tablet but it is really only a toy and does not pack the punch needed for a heavy duty or power  usage. For $79 (on sale) give it to the grandkids ages 5-11 they won't complain. It's useless for anyone over that age. Battery life is HORRIBLE. I'm sending it back tomorrow.
"I'm pleased with this purchase.  The battery life is amazing, even when playing games or watching a movie.  I have tried the camera and am impressed with the quality of picture taken.  I would recommend this product."
Its really cool.  I love how clear this picture is and the options that are available to the user is really awesome.  I'm glad I purchased this and would recommend it to all of my friends.
awesome product my wife loves it
"I like the clearness of the books,pictures and games. I also like hearing the sound without the earplugs.Being able to take pictures front or back. I am learning a lot about my Fire 7,7&#34; HD display."
"Great tablet and excellent reader, great games, apps and a wide selection of books."
"Was a replacement for another Kindle that wore out which was one of the originals  Is better then I expected and so fun to use. Is used to mostly read, and was a great deal."
It's awesome
This device allows ads to interfere with a game and freezes it for about 30 seconds.  My older kindle does not do that.  Very disappointing :(:(
Grandma loves this!
Great value.  Purchased for my spouse and she is enjoying it.
It's what I expected for the price. It does freeze up once in awhile.
Just wanted a tablet code my husband to use instead of his phone that was for work and didn't have a very big screen. Works perfect for everything we want to use it for and we like having it portable to use for Amazon music instead of using the phone and using up data.
There are just 2 things that ther Fire HD7 is short of in my opinion.  No zoom lens on camera and no GPS.<br />Is there likely to be an upgrade?
"I have grown to love this, but the battery goes faster than I expected, even though I have few apps. I'm still figuring it out, like how to install android apps, but the email app is great, I can see my books and documents, and the screen is super clear.<br />One thing not everyone else uses, but I love, is having it read my books to me. I don't buy the fancy, narrated audible version, I just have the computer voice read. The voice is better than the Kindle DX I wore out. It is wonderful to be reading in the morning, then get in the car and have it continue exactly where I was reading out loud until I get to work."
I just can't put it down it great!!
I like it but still having truoble connecting ti the internet for some reason:-(
Met my expectations easier to use.
I love the Fire HD.  The quality is prefection. It's speedy and I can read my text book while lounging in the pool.
great for the money
"I'm not delighted with the advertisements that come to the screen when I turn it on.  There may be a way to avoid that, but I have not had time to find out.  The reader itself seems to be superior to my old Kindle Fire."
I haven't fully checked it out but so far I am happy. Battery seems to run down faster than my old Kindle but probably to be expected.
"It's been great so far. I have a first generation kindle fire which I will give to a daughter.  She wants it for reading books.  I haven't gotten used to the split keyboard in the vertical format.  I don't have a reliably fast internet, and I think this generation kindle fire runs faster, especially when streaming video."
"It is an Awesome Tablet, my son loves it!"
"WONDERFUL!!  I'm very pleased that I bought it for myself.  This was a smart move on my part. The screen is large enough for viewing, the keyboard is large enough for typing."
"After one week, I Enjoy my Kindle. I've had the Kindle Fire HD before. So far I'm not seeing really a big difference. I'm not too Thriller with the start up page. I'm really not Interested in all those commercials. And I do Miss the &#34;Bookshelf&#34;. The Kamera could have been left out, it's not that great. But otherwise, I'm liking it."
Great value for the money
So far I'm loving it
Love it
"Works very well, downloads fast.  Only thing I would change is not being able to change the background screen images."
"I loved, loved,loved it.  It has been my constant companion since I received it.  You guys really hit the spot with this one and I had $40.00 off of the item also........"
Great Kindle...really enjoying it.  Use it all the time.
Love it
Why did I wait so long before buying the Fire?  My son loves his and is never without his.  I love the display and that I can read in the dark and have access to so many apps.  I don't need a lap top since I can carry this anywhere.  And the price was perfect for what I needed.  I'm enjoying this.
"We are still learning how to use it, so far we loveit."
"Compact, full featured, fast and portable. Meets all my internet access needs."
Was surprised the big difference from my Kindle Fire.  I am sure I will enjoy it very much.
"It came set to Spanish. After a very long time seeking assistance, the language was set to English.  Bad news is, My step-father loves the thing; it was a mother's day gift.  I might have to get another one for him."
"Disappointed to find it doesn't support Google play store. Also it has no micro-sd card support, only limited hd storage and cloud storage if you are connected via WiFi, which I'm not. You should use a password storage/manager like LastPass because kindle doesn't help with that. Also get the 2year protection plan because the screen cracks easily, I'm talking a drop from knee high while in a protective case.  Anyway, fun toy."
A friend of mine called to tell me that this Fire was on sale at Amazon.  I had debated about purchasing this one as opposed to the Fire HDX. I am amazed by the clarity and sound of the movies that have been watched so far.  Downloads are fast with no problems.  Still have much to learn about the device but so far all questions have been answered on the web site
Great product.  Really like that screen does not get dirty.  Very fast.  Good size
"I received the below mentioned complimentary product for the purpose of this review. All opinions are 100% my own<br /><br />Kindles have come along way since I bought my first one when they came out years ago. I have always been a fan of the Kindles but, I have to say the Kindle Fire HD 7 is much faster and the resolution is so much better than my old one. I love being able to take photos (my older Kindle does not have that ability) using either the front or rear camera. Also another great feature for me was the choice of colors They have so many to choose from it hard to decide.<br /><br />I am so happy with this new version. The older one I gave to my 5-year-old granddaughter so she can read books and play some games. If you're looking for a new Kindle I would recommend the Kindle Fire HD 7."
"Display is great, turn on is fast and response.is fast. Very well built, will find out more as I begin to use it more."
"just getting use to it,,,so far it.works fine.."
Love it.  Works perfectly for what I needed.
"The definition is great but I'm incredibly disappointed that I can't download a NOOK app so I can read the books I purchased on my previous kindle. Also, the ads on the start page are very annoying. What happened to the books and technology images?  This was a gift from a friend because I'd commented that my web speed on the kindle I had seemed sluggish on my 2011 kindle so he gave me the new one for my birthday. But I'm disappointed that I can't read my nook books on it. Why is that????"
"Bought four of these.  One for myself, my 5 year old twin boys, and 8 year old daughter.  We all LOVE them!!!  I found it pretty easy to set them up and put all the parental controls on them.  I did have to call Amazon a couple of different times to figure out how to do a couple of things such as download a game from one and sync up to the other three but Amazon customer service was great, walked me through the whole thing, and I waited less than a minute to talk to someone.  I would recommend these to anyone!!  I got the heavy duty Kindle Fire Poetic cases for each of them so I don't have to worry about the kids scratching the Kindle or breaking them and have been really happy with the cases as well!!!  I also put the Amazon Free time on all of them so the kids have a huge selections of kids shows and games to watch/play.  Very happy with our purchase and I am sure we will get years of use out of them!!!"
Works awesome love the apps its perfect
"I really enjoy it up to now, even my wife likes it considering she has an older Kindle Fire 7 inch that doesn't have a rear camera. I have been using it to surf the web and watching movies on it and the best thing of all is that I only paid $79.00 for this great device. Thank you Amazon, you're the best! By the way, I also purchased a case for it some days ago."
"Very pleased with my new kindle fire HD!  It was more than I expected, and the shipment was fantastic.  Great product."
"battery goes low fast, do not know how to use it. i'm older it is confusing"
I love it
"I am the biggest fan of the Kindle e-reader . I never leave home without it. Due to the price , I decided to purchase the Kindle Fire 7. The Kindle Fire is a fine tablet and easy to use. My biggest regret is not getting the bigger hard drive. I went through the order process too quickly to notice the drop down option for the 16gig hard drive. So if you are reading this review. Spend the little extra and get at least the 16 gig hard drive"
Did.not have the features that I expect.
love love love my kindle!!!!!!
"I did not know I would not be able to access google maps, play store and music. So can not read my books from there on the Fire."
"While reading, it often pops back to menu screen and when I attempt to return to the book I'm reading, it takes me back to where I was when I started."
I have always liked kindle the only reason I gave 4 stars was I don't get Google play on it otherwise it's a great item no regrets
"Works well as an inexpensive tablet.  Reading Kindle books is easy and the basic operation of the Kindle Fire HD is pretty simple.  Much of what I've learned about navigating the device has been intuitive. If my needs extend to considerable typing, a laptop or desktop with standard size keyboard is still the best choice but for portable, around the home work this device works well."
I like it real well!
"I have several electronic tablets.  I have the kindle reader, a samsung tab, the original kindle fire, and this new Kindle 7.  This is the perfect size.  I can carry it in my purse, take it with me to appointments and read to my hearts content.  When wifi is available I am able to do a little shopping on it as well.  I use it primarily for reading, but the other apps work great."
"Love it, love it, love it. Kindle Fire just keeps improving ! My praises are many, my favorite new praise is it seems to play most videos now. What with Adobe not supporting tablets & such, it's been a real Bear to get most videos & instructions to play but not so much with this one & that's Great ! 🙌"
Couldn't be happier with my new tablet!!! So much to offer and the price was great. I highly recommend this  product.
I love this tablet!  Easy to use and great graphics.  Now just to get 2 of the kid ones!
"Appears to be easy to use.  Like having all my books available in Cloud for all my compatible devices, but don't like that I can not put the books I have read into folders to separate them from the books I have not read."
Great product!
"I find it easy to use, download apps, movies and all the rest. It is heavier than the paperwhite, but I will adapt!  This is my first &#34;tablet&#34; and I think I am going to like it!"
"UPDATE:  I forgot to mention that my first generation Kindle Fire HD has just been put out to pasture.   We had been trying to stream Netflix and Amazon Prime movies/TV shows to our HD TV - and getting frustrated in the process. The Netflix app often crashed, or told us we needed a high-speed connection to make it work (we have the fasted Internet connection possible for residents - 50Mbps). Plus, the shows frequently were so pixelated and clunky that we had to restart the Kindle frequently. Often, the episode just buffered endlessly.   We moved the cable modem and wireless to within 15 feet of the Kindle, thinking that may be helpful. It wasn't.   So we bought an Apple TV device - and were floored by the Blu-ray quality of the images. No buffering. No Netflax app crashes. The Apple TV device absolutely blew away the Kindle HD we were using.   My assessment is that the Kindle Fire HD (First Gen) wasn't built for speed, didn't have a fast enough processor, and had problems with wi-fi.   If you have been having rough, choppy streaming, slow connections, frequent app crashes, or buffering issues, it's likely because your Kindle Fire HD isn't up to the task. Buy an Apple TV device and enjoy super high-quality streaming without a hitch - in full surround sound.   I'll never go back to the Kindle Fire again - no matter what the generation. It's not good for streaming. We don't read books on it. And music doesn't sound all that great. In short, what's the point of having the Kindle Fire HD?   ___  I bought the first generation Kindle Fire HD with the 7in screen. For the most part, it's operated okay - if a little slow and fussy at times. (More about that in a minute.)  I was going to buy the latest generation of the Fire HD 7in. But the availability reminds me of the old joke about Henry Ford making cars back in the day: &#34;You can have any color you want, as long as it's black.&#34;  That's the case here.  Amazon advertises a multitude of colors and options. Yet, when Itry to select a 16GB model in any color than black, I'm switched to an 8GB model or 6in screen model. Or, when I try to select the option of no advertising messages I'm shoved into the color black or 6in screen model. When it comes to those sponsored ads, what difference does it make what color or GB memory size I select?  I've been considering getting a new tablet, one with more memory or in other colors. I've kicked around an iPad, another Kindle, or a Samsung.  The fact that ordering the Kindle in any color other than black or size other than 8GB is near to impossible may tip the scale for me.  The Kindle Fire is okay. But I've owned iPads before and they're more powerful and now - thanks to the iPad Mini - just as light or lighter.  We use our Kindle Fire HD 7in for streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime movies/episodes. I've had problems keeping TV episodes on my Kindle Fire HD because Amazon keeps removing them. And I'm not talking about stuff I download from Prime. I'm talking about stuff I've paid for, that I allegedly &#34;own.&#34; It sometimes turns up missing. I'd have to contact Amazon and explain what's going on. The rep would apologize and download it again for me. Later, it would disappear again.  Silk is an okay browser. But it's no Google. Plus, there are constant questions from the apps about how we want it to proceed.  The first gen Fire HD 7 was a great entry-level tablet for streaming stuff. But it's not all that good for reading (Paperwhite is superior for that purpose), and the battery runs out pretty quickly. We're constantly charging it - with a very short cord that makes using it while charging it difficult.  I may have taken up Amazon on their $99 price for a new HD 7. But, as I wrote, it's 8GB and black (with special offers) or nothing. There's so little memory available to users that the 8GB is not even close to what we'd need. Plus, I would have liked to have had more color choices than black.  I guess I'll try iPad or Samsung for my nexttablet.  That's not a slight against the Kindle. It's been fairly reliable for what we use it for. But I think we need to try something new - even if it does cost 2-3 times more. You get what you pay for."

"OK, I really like this little tablet. For the money I do not think it can be beat.  ( I did get fortunate and caught it on sale for 79$ and paid the extra 15$ to get rid of the annoying ads and as already a prime member they registered for me.)Though I almost destroyed it when I started to put it in a protective cover I dropped it on the kitchen floor (about 4 ft) and it still worked like a fine watch. Whew! Not even a crack to the plastic casing. Although I would not recommend doing this. LOL I find the operating system to be quick so I am very satisfied. I use it a back up to my laptop when it is easier to take along than the laptop. I think the camera is satisfactory, though I use my Canon for most of picture taking. I would recommend this to anyone."
Absolutely love it. Purchased an HP stream 7 and just not as satisfied as with my Kindle Fire HD 7. Had the original Fire and loved it and will probably stick with Kindles from now on.
"Great price, great product.  Love it."
It's good
A very nice upgrade from my Kindle Fire.  Very pleased.
it's a good tablet to have around the house Terrible battery life. 24 hours max whether you use it or not. If you are an android user interface will not have a learning curve otherwise get ready to learn. Screen resolution is fantastic.
So far I am enjoying
Great Deal!!!!
"This by far is one of the best buys the color is to my standards, I gave it 4 stars because it some times does notlike to responde to commands, but a great machine."
"It is definitely a upgrade from the Kindle fire  I'm still playing with it to learn more of the options  but..........So far I love it.  I did have a time figuring out the Gen #  Now that I know I can order the right Cover  1st one I had to trim out for the camera but not a problem  It was cheap and to just have as a quick Protection at the time.<br />I did buy a Invisible Shield  had trouble with that.  My fault as the 1st time to do this.  should have watched a You tube installiation to help with this  Result I'm NOT happy with the shield, to My liking"
Great product and excellent price
Started with a 6 and lost it on a plane so upgraded to the 7. Better sound and memory if u upgrade for only $20 and got rid of ads for $15 (that's annoying) I could deal but I don't want my kid seeing ads.
Love it the grafics are amazing
Not comfortable to read with for more than 20 mins or so heavy and not very comfortable which was a surprise considering this was kindle.  however the browser and internet and all systems seem to work very well.
"Still can't get my books on IPhone or IPad! Otherwise, I just love it!"
The girlfriend spends hours on this thing. This is fine by me then she isn't asking for sex.
Does everything I need it to do and more! All at a very reasonable price too.
The effective screen size is smaller than 7&#34;. Screen response is bit leggy.  Very heavy for size and battery runs out in about 9 hrs with average use. No video running. Amazon store runs smoothly but Web surfing on its browser is slow.
I love this thing. The picture is so clear and it does everything I need it to.
AWESOME!!!! LOVE IT!!!!
I just keep ordering these. I like the look and feel.
My kids can watch Netflix while waiting at appointments and I can do everything and anything I need at any moment. It's lightweight so I don't even feel any extra weight in my purse.
"After finally getting it set up and the password straighten out, my husband really likes if! In time maybe better than his old one!"
Great love the duel cameras and the speed
My 3 year old loves it. Perfect!!
So far so good!
You can't go wrong with this fireHD kindle. Love it  This is my second one. One for traveling the other with the grandchildren. Love it love it love it
Died after two weeks
Great product. Simple and high quality. More than exceeds my needs.
Nice!
I had the 8.9 hdx but when it died no repairs were offered.  Best buy had none and we're not expecting any.  Feared u were discontinuing them because of defects(mine died at 15 months) but I loved it. This was just smaller so I went with it hoping u are revamping the 8.9
This was a mothers day gift and she truely loves it. Now if I could only break her away from it to help around the house.
Beautiful display. Very easy to use too. The Fire HD can do almost everything that my PC can do. Just love it!
"It is great I had to replace my first one, it also was great till it stopped working.  I am very happy with the kindle."
Wonderful!!!! Love it!!!
"Great new kindle, very fast with web and a great picture, very easy set up right out of the box."
"An affordable tablet that exceeds expectation. This is the fourth kindle fire I purchase and just recently bought another one for my son. Could've bought a comparable tablet but by far,this has the most free books on the market and as we are a family of readers so this was a no brainer. Everybody in our household now owns a kindle fire. We love the apps, the games, the book format, and now there are different colors to choose from with no additional charge. Just wish there's an optional expandable memory as the games and apps do take a bit of space (I know there's a 16 and 32 gig on the HDX but buying a memory card is cheaper ). Also, why didn't all the kindle fire not have the mayday button, I do not know but it wouldve been a nice feature. It's like saying you didn't pay nearly enough so you don't get it. It's all good though because they do have the tutorials if you're a kindle newbie.<br /> Will be buying it again, for sure."
Great quality!
Not that satisfied
"Kindle Fire HD is an amazing product! I thought that the original Kindle Fire was great (and it is), but I'm enjoying the HD even more!"
It is a great tablet. Got this one to replace the one my husband got me 2 and as half years ago.
Love it!!
"Nice compact size, fairly light weight, and definitely worth the price. I use it mainly to view content on Amazon Instant Video and it performs well in that environment. Battery drains pretty quickly."
"This is the 9th kindle I have purchased.  4 kindles for Xmas presents for adult children , 2- 7inch fires for myself and hubby, 2- 6inch for grandkids and now the 7inch HD. I had my fire for several years and the battery life was getting low so was excited to get the new HD.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  graphics and pictures are clear and crisp.  Faster than the fire. Like the camera that wasn't available on the fire, pictures are a bit grainy but don't plan on using it for professional grade pics.  Love the volume control on the outside of the case. nice keyboard. Obviously, I would recommend Kindle over the other tablets out there, for the price and features you can't get anything better in any price range"
"After 2 hours on tech support yesterday and 1 1/2 hours today, I was told my 16 month Kindle Fire HD has a hardware problem.  There is no where to take it for repair (or send it) and I was offered a $15 discount on the purchase of a new tablet.  Very disappointed.  I am surprised Amazon does not stand behind this product."
"Sharp graphics,quick response,glad I got one."
Works great
Taking a little time to get use to this version from the 1st generation.  Only problem I have had it froze up on me once at the end of a book I was reading. But it was worth the money and Kindle Fire compared to others out on the market well Kindle Fire wins!!
"It is really hard to see where this tablet makes sense.  It is no cheaper than other androids.  I have compared it to my other 7&#34; tablets and it sucks that battery quite a bit more, both when used and when resting.  I am constantly running into apps that won't work, app stores that cannot be accessed, and things that are glitchy.  Amazon has decided I CANNOT have my own wallpaper.  I CANNOT use Google Play.  In order to get Chrome, you have to really dig deep on the web, but Amazon has decided I CANNOT synch any bookmarks.  In general, it is a pretty limited tablet with some very useful features shut off.  Amazon support is sterling and some of the best I have found so that may tip the scale.  But if I had only one tablet, this would not be it.  Look carefully at what it will not do and be sure you don't want the missing features.  I am always reaching for the other tablet to do a lot of things that all the other tablets do with no problem.  I use the Fire about 30% of the time when it is for an app, but not for web access.  It is just to frustrating."
The Fire is so clear to view.
"Will not connect to 5ghz band on Trendnet AC1900 Dual Band Wireless Router, TEW-818DRU with standard firmware.  This router has 802.11 a, b, g, n and ac functionality.  I read the specs for the Fire HD tablet before purchasing and it stated does support dual band, and since I already have FireTV that connects to this router no problem, I was surprised when the Fire HD tablet would not.  I googled around for solutions, seems other people are in the same boat with pretty much no success and were very disappointed.  I tried a lot of things and just gave up, and I'm really good with tech, being a linux geek.  It could connect at 2.4 ghz (the router has separate SSID's for each band, and each band has a unique SSID) but my whole reason for getting a new tablet was to replace my aging samsung table which does not have 5 ghz support.  So, I sent back the Fire HD tablet.  Was very disappointed."
"This met all my expectations, I really enjoy using it."
It's.great.falls purpose for which it was purchased.
Love my new Fire.
Good
Nice tablet with very good color and brightness.
nice tablet....
"I've only had my Fire HD for a week. My son likes watching cartoons on my iPhone but then I can't use my phone, so I decided to get the Kindle for him and I both to use. He loves it so far. I have watched a few shows on it without issue. My only complaint is that downloading shows and navigating is harder because I'm used to my iPhone set up. Still figuring out the Fire."
"This device is very user friendly!! I absolutely love it! I got it as a Mother's Day gift! I had a Nook but it just didn't meet my expectations at all. I was very disappointed with it. Now, with my Kindle Fire HD 7, I feel like I got a Huge upgrade!!  I can't say enough about it! Really, really highly recommend getting one of these!!"
Great reader and perfect size
I had an older Kindle that quit working.  I like the larger screen and am still learning the differences and the navigational tools.
"Seldom is an electronic device all you want. This new Fire meets my wants. It is lighter, faster and a more clear display than the first generation Fire I replaced. The original Fire I had would not charge because the connector to the charger turned out to be faulty. Found out that was a common defect in the later life of my original Fire. The trade-in value was about $7.00. That was disappointing but the cost of the new device was very reasonable. Plus I  am still connected through wi-fi with Amazon for quick book and game downloads. Really fabulous and highly recommended."
"Fast processing and stunning display. Seems very durable for a tablet however I do not like the fact that you can not turn off special ads without payment, there is no way to customize home or lock screens with wallpaper, turn off carousel, have no access to Google play store or play music, and have to 're purchase all me stuff through Amazon."
"Love this device, it's small enough to not be intrusive, yet big enough that I can watch movies comfortably. The color is a bonus"
"So far I'm pleased with the overall performance and the features that are standard. A great value and thus far do not regret not buying the Galaxy I thought I'd rather have. I read a lot and didn't want to hassle of going outside of Amazon and the Kindle store.<br />I get email, facebook and other items I used to use a laptop to access. The camera is surprisingly high quality."
"Unfortunately, for the games, so does my husband and grand-daughter! Love the ability to set up tabs so each can have a place to play all their favorite games without messing with anyone else's game scores or book pages."
"We love it! Nice big screen. Had to give 4 stars because of the packaging. It was in a thin bubbled yellow envelope. It was tattered and torn. It took a beating. I took it out, charged it, and looked over it. No damage on the outside. Really hoping it wasnt shook up too badly. I only messed with it for about 15 minutes. Put it away for my daughters birthday on the 23rd. It would've been nice to have it in a box with padding of some sort. Kind of expensive to just be shipped in an envelope..."
It is quick but aops fill up the space quickly so I am removing apps often.
Still trying to figure out what everything is....but I do love it!!
"This is an excellent device, and it's easy to use."
What fun!!!  The adults as well as the children loved them.  The laughter was loud and fun.
I bought this for my grand daughter and she absolutely loves it. It works wonderful and it's a nice price.
A replacement for my other one. Works well.
Very good screen. Very satisfied at such a price.
It was a gift for my husband who lost his original one on the plane. He is thrilled to have one again.
"This Kindle Fire is better than the first one I owned.  The graphics are sharper, the response is quicker, I can take photos.  Happy that I upgraded!"
Great value.
We love it!
"Very easy to use. I'm not very good on computers and such, so I am very pleased with my new Fire HD 7."
Love my kindle fire. I have had several. The plugin always gets loose and won!t let me charge it any more
"Really fast and crystal clear tablet.  Easy to read outside, much better than my first kindle.  I believe I will be very happy with the Fire HD."
This is my second fire hd 7. I gave my first one to my 6 year granddaughter.
Awesome little tablet!  Thrilled to get it!
"What a versatile little tablet! So many different functions and capabilities. It is absolutely a worthwhile purchase and its intrinsic value far exceeds the price I purchased it for! Bravo, Amazon on your development of an outstanding user friendly product."
The Fire is a great value.  We own 3 and all work great.  We have even dropped one from the counter without damage
Love it!!!!
This is my second Kindle and I'm enjoying it.
I needed a tablet to read PPT slides. However quickly I noticed the screen was too small and it was really clunky. I did not like the OS and just felt it was not worth hating.
"I bought this because my sister kept telling me I have to get a Kindle, I currently own a Tablet which I love.  This Kindle was at a good price for that day so I purchased it.  I am learning to get around with it and I am loving it.  Thanks to my sister and thanks to Amazon for having a one day sale.  It is awesome.  I just ordered a cover and stylus for it, so excited.  Thank you Amazon Kindle."
I love my new Kindle Fire 7 HD.
"Absolutely love it. This is my second Fire, the first one has given me nothing but enjoyment."
Great size! Haven't had a kindle so getting used to it. Can't find my bank app but not Amazon's issue. Really like the portability of it. My ipad3 is too big and bulky.
Love my new Fire.  I had an old Fire that was giving me problems and glad to finally have a new updated version.
got it for my wife - she is happy with it
"This made it to me right on schedule. I find it very easy to use, lightweight, kid friendly. I absolutely love it!"
I always love kindles I just wish they were lighter not so heavy.
"I love this, it's not just a reader anymore!  Took me a little bit to figure it all out, but it's easy - especially if you've used an iPad or iPhone. My old Kindle has served me well and I loved it, but it's getting a little quirky so when Amazon had this on their Gold Box deal I couldn't pass it up.  I'm so glad I got it!  Email, camera, reader, internet access - the only thing it doesn't do is make phone calls.  And the screen is amazing, it's so clear and colorful.  Haven't tried the music player yet, but I have no doubt it's as great as the other features.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone."
"Love my Fire HD 7!  I waited a long time to convert from the old kindle to a Fire, but the special offer drew me in.  So glad I have it!  It is easy to learn how to use.  Just love it!"
"Front and back camera is a plus, Camera quality could be better but overall I like this version of the kindle. The color is awesome, and the kindle is light weight (not heavy or bulky). Definitely a great choice!👍"
Haven't had enough time yet to do much with it. I just wish it was larger but that is my fault nothing up do with the item.  Very happy I got it much earlier than was stated.<br />Thank you
Beautiful product!
Not an iPad but 1/3 the price! I am still learning what it can do. So far so good.
"I have had a first generation Kindle for years and loved it.  Unfortunately that Kindle was recently stolen so it was time for a new one and I love my new Kindle.  It is faster, bigger and the HD screen is a great improvement.  This generation is an even better version of an already great product"
"Much nicer than the original Fire that it replaced. Battery life could be better. But all in all a nice tablet for Kindle reading, as well as general use."
"Note worthy updates in this 4th gen relative to 1st gen.  Nice, crisp display.  Kindle shines again."
I really like it
"I've had this for 1 week and it's already slow, has needed to be restarted several times and the pictures it takes are crap. This is my 3rd kindle I guess I shouldn't keep trying them. I wanted to like it because it's affordable but they don't work well. Trying a different brand next time."
"well Amazon...I love it if I could totally understand the user guide. You need to include a printed on paper guide for people who are not tech. smart. I had to pay 6.99 for a user guide that should be free. Come on guys, lessen the call to HELP and print up a guide.<br />Next make the on/off button larger for old eyes and why not give a discount to we seniors who want to buy?<br />I am slowly learning to love it and love having bought PRIME as it gives me many advantages."
Light and fast.  Got it with the kids case.  Daughter loves it and kindle free time.
I love it!
Bonniebooks37@yahoo.com.  Heavier than my nook but  offers many free books which Barnes and Noble does not ! Instead of the Nook I  now recommend kindle fire to my friends
"I'm still learning all this can do.  I am new to using a Fire Kindle, and wanted one so I did not have to lug my computer all over.  I like what am able to accomplish so far, and will continue to learn."
battery could last a little longer
Awesome
It is not easy to use. I can't get the apps I want.
My son loves it. And I bought the extra protection plan too.
The capabilities of this tablet is far more than my expectations.
"I love this kindle, I had one of the early kindle fire that I used for a long time but the new Fire HD 7 is really a big improvement."
I love it! It's the perfect little tablet and reader in one and the price is unbeatable.
I ordered 3 kindle one for myself and one for each of my daughter s. They arrived early and in perfect condition. They work great. We love them.
"I have to say that as a tablet it functions very well.  Having said that there are a few idiosyncrasies with the os:  not very intuitive, you are already in the mode to make changes and it keeps asking you to input the code.  You have to go through the whole menu to access deleting apps.  Otherwise I love the freetime for my kids and being able to limit my kids time on.the device.   Last but definitely not the least:  When I purchased the Kindle I was not aware that there would be FORCED ads on the lock screen.  I DONT LIKE IT, IT IS INTRUSIVE.  I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THESE FIRES IF I HAD KNOWN.  I'm not sure if there is a way to opt out of ads just yet, I've only had these for a few days.  If that is the case I will change my review. *UPDATE* Got rid of the ads!  Mostly works well.  I like the different accounts I can create for the kids.  It doesn't always work smoothly but mostly it does."
I am somewhat disappointed a lot of the game apps I play are not available for the fire. So much of the Fire is geared towards Amazon. I really thought I was getting a tablet that would fulfill all my needs. Just a lesson learned.
I have been a proud kindle fire owner since the first fire tablet hit the market.  This is by far the best one so far. I love the new layout and the fact it comes in your favorite colors. I bought the 16 gb and for only $119 which is way less then I played for my 8gb original fire. The speakers are much louder then previous models. The battery power is about average for this type of device which basically means it sucks. I do miss the longer charging cable of previous models but other then that I am extremely happy.
Terrific product. Loved my tablets so much started buying these as gifts. Got this on a one day sale for $79 saving sixty something bucks. This made the perfect gift I could not be happier with the purchase and the recipient could not be happier with her birthday present.
"I have 3 kindles and a Samsung tablet. I love my kindles! They are easy to operate, reliable, and have amazing battery life! I even talked my sister into getting one and she loves hers!"
No real directions on how to best use it!
Amazing!
Kids absolutely love their new tablets
Love it!
"The HD7 has met all expectations.  Bright color.  Easy enought to use for a non-technical person.  The only problem I had was with the screen protector which is stiff, not so easy to install without getting little particles of dust that create air bubbles and the screen reflects glare.  If getting a screen protector, get one that is a little more pliable and non-glare."
Very happy! I can't put it down. I only wish it had more of the apps I was looking for but it has what I use most.
Excellent
What a great deal!  And this is my second Kindle Fire!  Highly recommended!
Wishing I could get some of the Google apps .otherwise very happy with the tablet
im still learning how to use it. wasnt born with a tablet in my old hand. I do like the features.  worry about remembering to cancel that news paper in 6 months. think ill keep prime and cancel cable tv.  good experience so far.
I love this device.  It is easy to use and I can watch my movies and play my games.
Excellen
The Internet is extremely slow. I would not recommend this product.
"Fire HD7 is outstanding in every way. User friendly, intuitive, keep up the good work. I also have the first kindle fire."
"I love this!  Easy to use and a very nice size.  There is so much you can do on this and I haven't scratched the surface yet.  Love to read my books and playing games are visually stunning.  All the pictures are so crisp.  I have not used the camera yet, so can't comment on that.  I have to say that downloading books from my Kindle keyboard is a pain.  It only lets me do 10 books at a time and I currently have over 500 to move.  Ugh!  A pain.  But it's cool, I'll get it done.  Eventually.  Everything else so far is pretty sweet.  Thanks!"
Love it. Great picture runs fast
"I have an older Kindle and love it!! Fits easily in everything and the battery lasts forever! My hubby bought this for me to try and it's pretty great! I love that it had all the features his IPad has....games, camera, books and Internet. The only downfall is when I'm outside reading I still have to use my other Kindle because this has a bad glare and you can't see to read!!"
"The battery life, so far, has been good, but other than that I feel it is a promotional commercial for Amazon all the time. Small screen, difficult to maneuver from site to site. Don't like the browser it selected and it will not allow me to change. Wouldn't buy again."
"If you have spent much time using an iPad, you will find this device frustrating.  I'm a software product manager, and it I spent 15 minutes just trying to find the Settings screen.  I finally found it by using the &#34;Search&#34; feature and searched for &#34;Settings&#34;.  A week later, I'm still not sure if you can find the device settings from the OS menu.<br /><br />This device is very spammy.  The home screen each time you start up the device features an advertisement.  Within the first 3 seconds of using the Silk browser I received a &#34;You have been selected for x...&#34; popup.  To receive said popup I simply typed youtube.com in browser and clicked &#34;Go&#34;.<br /><br />I summary, the Kindle Fire is a cheap iPad knock off.  Half baked, and not very thought through.  Then again, it's cheap"
Great so far.  Still learning how it all works!
"The Fire 7&#34; HD is a great inexpensive tablet ($99 8GB model)  . It dose almost everything the big guys do in a compact package. The screen is acceptable although a bit too glossy for my taste,but easily corrected with a non glare screen protector. The ability to connect to Amazon and down load movies,music,books with one click make this a great &#34;user friendly&#34; device.<br />Only 4 stares because of it's inability to connect it directly  to your HD TV. Amazon Engineers fix that and you have a 5 star winner."
Very nice.  This is the second one purchased for our family.  Use it all the time!
Love the new Kindle. Has enough bells and whistles for me to enjoy when I check what's going on in the world of sports. The only setback is sometimes the wifi doesn't connect even though the main box in the house is connected.
Love it better than my nook!
"Google is actively trying to strangle non-Google licensed Android devices from the market like this one. So before you buy this, consider:<br /><br />1) No Google Play Store, where all of the best apps live<br />2) No Google Docs (Drive, Sheets, Docs, etc).<br />3) No Google Maps either<br />4) No Google Chrome<br />5) No Gmail app<br /><br />You can read books, watch videos, etc. Think of it as a window into your Amazon content. Do NOT think of it as a general purpose Android tablet."
The Kindle met all my expectations
The battery life is not long and I found it difficult to shut down applications.  If I have music going and I'm reading a book the battery will be gone in a couple of hours.  If I want to close the music player I have to turn the device off  and then back on to accomplish this.
I LOOVEE my new Amazon KIndle. It is fast easy and replaces my Kindle Fire without HD. It couldn't be better!!!!! My 74th yr birthday gift!
"Purchased as a gift for nephew, and the look on his face was priceless. He loves it and uses for music, books and games."
"It took me a little bit to understand how to use my Kindle Fire HD, but once i figured it out I LOVE IT!!"
"Excellent multi tool for someone on the go. Not just a reader, but a way to keep in touch with the world around you."
Much faster than the original Kindle Fire and the screen is brighter and more vivid.
"I love it! The processor is fast,  the screen is crisp and I love that it's comfortable to handle."
"So far I'm really liking this kindle. I have had the original fire for several years and loved it. After it started having problems I knew I had to get another. This blows it away. I love that it is connected to my Goodreads account. I do wish the covers for my old fire fit this one. But oh well, it's a good excuse to get new ones. There are so many upgrades from the original In can't believe I didn't get this one sooner."
"Great priced tablet for reading news sites in the evening. Amazon ecosystem is great, especially if you have a prime membership. Pleasantly surprised with the screen quality and speakers (great for prime music/pandora and not too shabby video). Definitely recommend as a media consumption tablet."
I love it  didnot think i would because I like the REAL books so much.
My granddaughter loves playing games on it!
A like it very much.
"I was happy when it arrived. It was well packaged, and arrived on time.  When I turned it on,  the image looked rather clean.  Then I set it up, nothing too tedious. Then I opened the interface.  The organization of the interface is annoying and haphazard. The options menu,  which you can always access, is well enough executed. However I noticed ads on everything, even my screen saver.  Thus far I've not found how to disable it, and set a background.  Furthermore,  although this is written with Android, you have no access to the Google play  store, and as such you are missing get out on many of the apps you may have on your other devices.  All in All its a nice monitor which streams Netflix well,  and you can read books on.  Besides that,  meh"
"It was a gift from my brother and I just love it..  Quick  an convenient way to look up my email and FB.  Love to read so it is so great as a reader,"
Would like something a little larger but really like the price.
There are a lot of apps that are not available on it
I love it
It was not even worth the $79 price. Simply awful processing power. When buttons were pressed sometimes seconds to react
Received this for my five year old. She loves it. I have one and it's an 7 HDX and I love it also. My 10 year old has one and enjoys playing games and reading books. We enjoy it and love having them.
Greatly enjoy my fire HD 7. Recommend it highly.
I am not happy with this device. It has almost NO STORAGE.  It bumps you off the internet and says &#34;critical storage&#34; low.  Can't keep any pictures or video.  I keep deleting and clearing the unused items and they come back! Was really excited about the Amazon Freetime Unlimited but it doesn't work if there's no storage!  I wish I spent the money for an iPad!
After using a first generation kindle I am in love with this new kindle.  I'm still learning as I work my way through it.  Only downside is that I miss the light letting me know when it's fully charged.
This has definitely met my expectations. It was delivered ahead of time. And the price for this item was exceptional.
"It is great, just need to learn how to work it. But like it..."
So far it's great! Had to go out of the way to get the Nook app for it which made me nervous. The battery life doesn't seem as long as my Nook Color's is. But I am loving watching Netflix on it.
It's great. I have a kindle & all of my books transferred to my new Fire. I can read emails & save photos to amazon cloud on it.
Works great and quite durable.  Good value.
Having more fun with it than I thought<br />Glad my girls talked me into buying.
"I bought this Kindle Fire HD for my daughter, due to the FreeTime capability of setting time limits and restricting access to certain things.  From the minute she pulled it out of the box, she has loved it and continues to fall in love with it more and more with every app I add.  I just wish I could put Prime Video access to the Child account, as I do allow my daughter to watch cartoons on my Prime Video account.  I use the password protection option on my Video access to keep her limited.  That's really the only complaint I have so far.<br /><br />My husband and I will be using the Fire HD primarily for reading and Prime Video.  The Kindle Lending Library is awesome.<br /><br />My daughter took it with her to visit my parents and they both want Kindle Fires now, so I guess I'll be ordering more for Christmas. :)"
It was supposed to be a surprise but you emailed me and spoiled it!  So I received my mother's day gift early. I am really enjoying.
love my tablet
I love it!
Came fast and works great. I don't need a lot of memory so the 8 GB is plenty. Yes I would recommend this item.
Great tablet for the price
"Easy to use, nice size. Love it."
It was a gift for my wife. She hasn't put it down since she got it.
"Have only had it for a few days, but so far it's great.  No problems with anything.  Good, clear music and pictures."
So happy & excited to finally have a Fire HD.  It's everything and more than I expected.
So far so good...
Internet doesn't stay connected.  I have no problem with my other devices.
"It is much more than I hoped for. Great sound, picture, camera. I love the addition of the slideshow to photos. Was pleased to find the speech to text added to the keyboard which helps me who had a stroke and only have one hand to type . I use my Kindle for just about everything and I can't tell you how much I love this upgrade . Keep up the good work!"
Absolutely love it! Now I have two Kindle Fires and it's fantastic.
This was a great deal for $79
Tablet is great for the price. Got it for only $99 on sale at Amazon. For that price this tablet was a steal. Functions well and has a great sound!.
"I love my new kindlefirehd! Love that I can print from it!! I had kindle fire for over 5 years I think and got this upgrade for Mother's day. Old one was great too, but love this one better!! I love the camera with front and back capabilities, and the video. Could be little bigger in size but this one fits my hand better. Thank you Amazon!!"
I like
"Love it.  Fits right in my hand, light wait.  Perfect for surfing the web and playing my games, checking on my email."
Love it. Good price. Great Kindle!!!
"Wow, I love it. It does everything and more than I could ask for from a tablet at this price!!! Thank you for making it."
Love it ! Does a great job
"Beyond my expectations. This is a great new toy for me. It's just fabulous. I watch movies, listen to music, you can do so much with this device. Picture clarity is awesome. Love it!"
"I'm still learning all the Kindle Fire HD7 can do, and I'm impressed.  My only complaint so far is that the online Help system has told me that my device should have come with a mini-USB cable, and mine did not.  So until I get one, I'm unable to transfer photos or music from my computer to the Kindle Fire.  A small issue for me right now, but it's irritating that a part that should have accompanied my device was left out.  Oh well.  It's still a terrific device, and one I'll be using a lot."
Perfect! I love it
"My wife has an ipad and loves it and says it is really operator friendly.  I have a Kindle paper white and when the Fire tablet came on sale I bought one and found it extremely easy to use and though the ipad photos may be somewhat clearer I found the fire tablet's photos to be fine and I actually found the photos better not being so sharply focused.  It handles my e-mail and internet usage just fine and will be tying it in with my fire TV.  I can't comment on gaming as I'm not into that usage and therefore I give only 4 stars as I suppose gaming is a big deal and I've no idea how it does.  That being said for the price it does everything I needed quite well. Oh ya, wi-fi works just fine."
My husband loves this!
loved it but husband took it he loves it
I love it
this device does not come with the free trials that it states. also i am unable to load movies onto it. customer service is not helpful.out of the many different people i spoke to they all had heavy accents and spoke poor English. they were not able to answer my questions or help. they told me they would fix the free trials for me but then put me on hold and came to tell me they would not fix them.
Just what I was looking for
I was ready for an upgrade from my Fire HD.  I am not disappointed!
Love the Kindle Fire HD even though I didn't buy it from Amazon
Great!
less then 4 gb are availed on this model. If your advertising it as an 8 gb then like any other device make it able to support at least 6.8 g.  Not 3.9.  Or give us the ability to expand it with a micro SD card. other then the obvious lack of anything close to 8 gb of space this tablet is a great buy.
Great! Kids love them! !
Great product.
Love it.
I love it!
Great. But you better get more than 8gb
"The Fire HD 7 is 8GB, but the user only gets less than half of that for apps, books, photos, etc.  This isn't very much!  It would be nice if the devices were rated by what is actually available to the user."
I love it!!! Product was just as described!!!
"I really think the 3rd Generation Kindle is a much better quality device because it is much clearer. This reminds me of the Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; tablet. I did not like it because of it's quality also. The 4th Generation also does not have the HDMI outlet on the device. Still learning more about other features. Maybe that is why when first advertised at $159 for 16g then all of a sudden a price drop to $99.00 was the reason, I don't know, but the price could've dropped even further to $79.00, just disappointed in the 4th Generation Fire HD 7, 7&#34; Display.. Will hang on to my 3rd Generation Kindle Fire HD 7, 7&#34;, 8GB.. Glad it does have front facing and back facing camera. By the way, camera pictures are not a good quality, either.."
Wonderful product
"so many new things to try on kindle,only disappointment with purchase was no power/charger included,luckily my phone charger works for Kindle to."
"It,s ok.I thought i could just use my old password from my kindle.Now i have to download all my games and start over."
Love everything about it except the ads when I boot it up! I guess special offers means annoying ads when you turn it on!
I had to get a power cord for my old reader. While I was waiting on it the fire went on sale. Now I don't have to wait till one charges. Love my new Fire
Had difficulty connecting to the wi-fi.
Happy with my new kindle only wish I had know that I could not use my old case. Plugs and off switch in different spots old case would not work because of it.
Reasonably priced. Serves my purpose. Picture and sound quality pretty good.
"I bought it for my 2 year old son since he kept taking his grandparents, best purchase I've made all year. He loves it and its stable enough for a toddler to handle. :)"
My new kindle fire HD is everything I expected and more. The picture is crisp and clear. I'm still learning my way around it.  I'm happy for such a frist rate product<br />And the great price.
Love it. I already own a Samsung galaxy 10.5 but was to bulky to take every where with me. The fire works perfectly fits in my purse and fast enough processors to do anything you need.
No problems.  Works very well. Am very pleased.
My problem was that I couldn't get everything transferred over to kindle fire from my kindle. Some did and some didn't and never did figure it out
I don't like it
Love it !! Thank you 😁
We like to call ourselves Amazon junkies. :-) We love the Kindles. Eaxh one in my family has one. Wouldn't have anything else!
"Easy to navigate, simple to set up wireless and apps. Movies look fantastic in HD."
Love it!!!
Good value
Love my new Fire HD 7!
Reasonably priced but photos weren't too great.  Other features were great for the price.
A great tablet at a great price.
Very happy with the Fire HD 7....especially the camera.  I would give it a 5 star rating if I didn't have to see the special offers every time I open it up.  Any way to get rid of them??!!??
"The kindle tablet is extremely durable. This allows my 3 year old to use it without fear of breaking. The tablet has taken multiple spills, dives and crashes and has never suffered a broken screen. I highly recommend a screen protector for this tablet if you have kids using it. I have had all sorts of mystery substances over this tablet but it still runs like a champ. Since the get go my kindle has suffered crashes, and freezes. I have tried unsuccessfully to download a app killer but that has done nothing. The tablet restarts whenever it feels like it, and the screen saver gets frozen.<br /><br />*Pros<br />Extremely Durable one of the most rugged tablets I have ever used<br />Lots of amazon apps to download<br />Ez with the amazon apps<br />Free Music and Books threw the amazon store<br /><br />Cons*<br />Frequent Crashes, Freezes and Malfunctions<br />If you already have prime the free year of prime is not included."
This is like carrying around my ipad but so more convenient.  Great buy!
"For my applications, HD 7 is very appropriate. I read and get news and the WIFI is now available wherever I need it. (I had a 3G Kindle.)"
Bought this for my nephew to replace a cheaper tablet. He loves it!
Awesome little tablet.
Just as great as the old one that quit.
"Definitely not the best tablet out there, but this one is quite capable. If you want a study, usable media device this does the trick for quite cheap. I wouldn't say it could replace a laptop or even a more powerful tablet(iPad) for work related tasks. Only downside is that it's totally geared toward making you buy more stuff at Amazon."
Great!  Very easy to operate..
Amazing.  Got this for my mother-in-law who is older and less techy but loved this. It replaced her laptop and was a nice step in the right direction for getting her ready for a smartphone.
Excellent!  Best tablet for the price.  Only drawback is no direct access to Google apps.  I get it; I hate Google too.  Get many more Amazon apps.
The best tablet for the money!  Amazon Fire 7 has more than exceeded my expectations!
First it didn't fit right...and very cheaply made. Too much to send back..not happy!
"It is everything I expected, very satisfied with this product."
"Hate the instant on commercials!  Like my old 1st generation Fire better in a lot of ways.  New one doesn't hold charge as long.  Not sure if I like the front & back camera.  Feels like I'm being watched all the time.  They even said that they could 'observe' me & when they did a + sign would come on.  It comes on frequently. They said I could turn it off, but I've forgotten how to navigate there to find it.  The only reason I bought a new one is because the battery on the old wouldn't hold a charge at all if unplugged.  I need a longer cord for the new one so that I can use it in bed when the battery goes dead (this never happened on my brand new Fire 1 for a long time.)  Can't find where to purchase a longer cord on my new Kindle or on Amazon. They have it, because they showed it briefly & I thought I could go back later & order it, but couldn't find the site.  I like the fact that I can get to YouTube & watch any video I want at any time, as long as the battery is working. Couldn't do that on the older model.  Maybe it's still too new to me & I haven't gotten used to navigating it yet.  All in all, I would buy it again because the price is so low & the value so high compared to anything else.  It's light & small size will fit in an average purse which is wonderful for me.  The picture is excellent & the sound louder than my old one. I can hear it clearly now. LOL!"
"Not so ez to buy apps for my grandaugtjer I wanted this to be a learning tool and Have a lot of dificulta get in the right things, cindy"
Everything about it is super. There's. No other in comparison. My granbabies enjoy all it's. Features.
Only had it a short tie but its better then I expected.  Still has small print though...old eyes need it just a bit larger.  Will give a better review after I've had it for awhile. I should get the keyboard for it.
Similar to the kindle fire. Easy to use.
"Very nice quality unit, a little heavier than I am used to with my paper white kindle. Took me a little while to figure it out even though the instructions are on the unit, it took me a while to find them. Very nice display and response."
"From Anna,<br /><br />To Whom It May Concern, Slow to learn how to work my Kindle.<br /><br />Anna"
I love it!
This kindle is a piece of crap the keyboard is awful it is always spacing and skipping on it's own.  Was told this would be better than my previous kindle and paid a lot of money.  Very very disappointed
"Wish it was compatible with more third party movie/video streaming applications. Would elaborate, but really no need."
Excellent tablet
Love this Fire HD 7.  Purchased it for my granddaughter but instead gave her my Fire HD and kept this one for myself.  The color is also beautiful.
"I am very pleased with my Kindle, sorry  nit  took me so long before purchasing it  sooner !"
"I do not have a problem with the Kindle itself.<br />What I do have a problem with is I ordered this as a gift in a specific color,<br />while it did arrive new in package with no damage seen, the color specified was not what was delivered.<br />What is the purpose of having a choice of colors and when the item delivered is BLACK, not the color wanted/ordered.<br />I do not want to have to return a gift that is very much appreciated because of this.<br />Again my family enjoys the Kindles and we have no problem with the product.<br />This is not the first time that I have had issues with AP being mistaken about a product."
"Fell I love with it.  Nice size to read off of.  Love the ability to adjust fonts, etc.  Battery life is surprisingly long"
I think it is great
Not happy  with this Kindle.  Will return it.
I've had the tablet for over 2 weeks now and I love everything about it .
"[[VIDEOID:6f43399544259e4fc8d0cd0ba10ddb80]]This tablet is amazing. I had originally purchased the HD6, but it started freezing on me after two days. I also thought the screen was a little small for a tablet, and thought the HD7 was just a better deal all around. I purchased it on a sale day so I got the HD7 16gb for $100!<br /><br />For the price, this tablet is amazing. My boyfriend has downloaded a bunch of game apps and plays them constantly!  The graphics are amazing for the price of this tablet. I seriously don't know why anyone would bother purchasing an ipad or any other more expensive tablet!The battery life is pretty amazing and the quality of the whole tablet is fantastic.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase this again!"
Its great I love it and it makes it so much easier to read books
And I can read at the beach with my sunglasses on!
"I enjoy using my kindle everyday, many times a day!  The camera is fun and easy. This kindle hasn't met all my expectations and more."
"My second Fire, only updated with cameras (yessss).  For the price, there is no better tablet."
"So far, I love it."
"Much better than my old Kindle Fire but I am keeping both.  I can use a keyboard and all other bluetooth capabilities.  Get 16 GB or more memory, otherwise it may be impossible to store anything worthwhile (music and videos) for a trip."
"For the price and the specs, this seemed like an awesome deal. The tablet looks great and not cheap looking. The tablet runs pretty smoothly. Apps and games run without a hitch. But there are some things to note!<br /><br />This tablet is less than $100, so don't compare to fancy tabs like Samsung Tab 4 etc.<br /><br />This is not your normal Android. This is a modified android. Consider this a new type of OS then. IE: you can't access Google play store (though there are lots of apps from there on the amazon store), you don't have a 'desktop' or 'home screen' like an android, you can't put a wallpaper (without mods) and there are no face buttons (Back, home etc). The buttons to go back or home are on the display, not on the tablet itself, so it will be up to the GUI to display those buttons.<br /><br />The home screen consists of a menu on top, a 'carousel' which shows your recently used apps, and a favorite list on the button (something like your android icon dock on the bottom). It takes a while to get use to these differences and once you do, it is actually really comfortable.<br /><br />Of course, if you can't adapt to it comfortably, you would be require to perform a few tricks and back flips to by pass or modify these (all without rooting or hacking your device... no worries)<br /><br />Treating the Tablet how it is, I am not disappointed by its performance. I ran a few games, watched a few movies, used a few social apps and I did these without headache or frustration. In other words, it does what it does properly.<br /><br />The rear camera has no LED flash, and the picture quality is somewhat okay in bright enough light. Not the best, but acceptable. When there isn't enough light, the picture gets grainy and looks like my old phone camera.<br /><br />The speakers are fairly loud and comfortable for personal use. Of course you can hook up an external speakers or headphones via the headphones jack.<br /><br />Battery life seems long enough, although I haven't really put that to the test as yet...<br /><br />Screen display is bright, crisp and clear. I could easily dim the lights during the night. The image quality is very good.<br /><br />Storage space is the downfall here. I am not going to load it up with movies and stuff, but with 5GB barely to use, you're going to have to manage your apps and files a lot. Thankfully, with the apps, I can store my apps on the 'Cloud' if I don't need them at the moment. When I'm ready (need internet connection) I can pull the app from the cloud back onto my device and use it as normal. There is no external memory (SD Card capability) so use your online storage like Onedrive or dropbox etc for your files, documents and pictures.<br /><br />I still have to test out other features like connecting to a TV via the HDMI adapter, connect a bluetooth keyboard etc, but as far as just using the tablet goes, I am satisfied!really put that to the test as yet...<br /><br />Screen display is bright, crisp and clear.

Best tablet it better than my wife ipad
"It really is great, much better than my regular HD."
Great price and a great buy.  Thanks Amazon!
Its just fine.
As always...very pleased with Kindle!!!  I would not pick any other device.  This is my third one (the other two passed onto my kids) and I'm in love!!!!
"Have not had it very long so I do not want to be unfair. I am unable to down load instructions after 45 min connected. My 11 year old plays games ok, also is able to order items from Amazon using one click without my password. I tried to order books but was informed my activities would be posted to face book. No ones business what I read, I do not use face book for that reason. Still can not find out how to view movies.  I will keep it since my son plays games, but he can do that on my phone."
Great!
"I love my Fire HD. It's easy to use.  I Facebook, search the web, anything I can do on my laptop I can do with my Fire HD."
Easy to read. Easy to shop. Fun for the occasional game although that iisn't my main focus. Seems to hold a charge well.
Very nice little machine. Bought for my son. He is six and loves it. Very sturdy takes a licken and doesn't miss a beat. Bought one for my daughter few months ago so she could keep in touch with family back in new york. Both kids love their kindles. Tough machines that work very well. I am a little jealous my tablet doesn't work nearly as well.
"I bought this for my 82 year old mother so she could enjoy reading.  I wasn't real sure how she would respond to the Kindle as she is not a techy person.  She LOVES this Kindle!!  She says it was the greatest gift ever.  She reads, checks out facebook, goes online, looks for recipes, etc.  She uses the various apps to go to different sites, etc.  I think Amazon needs to promote this for Seniors and maybe have some featured healthcare apps.  Mom could never get used to a smart phone but she rarely has her Kindle out of reach."
Great tablet but then I've never been disappointed with a Kindle
"This is the sixth kindle that I have purchased.  Most were for my immediate family, but one was a gift. I have been pleased with all of them. I bought this particular Kindle to replace an old one that I had. I really like it."
I was so surprised to receive this as a birthday gift from my sister. It is more than I had expected.
I received this as a gift just before I left for a trip.  My kindle enabled me to be able to pass away my time sitting in the airport and on the airplane while being entertained watching TV shows and movies and playing games.  It is a comfortable size and weight both for viewing and for holding.  The external speakers are great for listening to music and watching movies.  I had no problems connecting it to the internet.  Very happy with my gift!
"Dissapointed that I was unable to install Google Play, so I would be able to connect with my Chromecast.  I shoud have researched further before purchasing."
Every part of the purchase process was flawless. Only negative is.... if you are not in touch with a computer...there are no hard copy documents included to give you a clue as to the set up......the device is really amazing if you can figure out all of its capabilities. Sound and picture is beyond expectations......also if you want the 4 g version of the Kindle it is difficult to find info on the process of getting connected.
"Great little device, especially at the featured price."
"Nice tablet, very personal."
doesn't hold a charge;  takes all night to re-charge
"Wonderful device!  Much, much more user friendly than the deluxe Samsung tablet I had for which I spent $350.  The response time on the Fire HD is almost instantaneous when connecting to the internet, etc.  And when I have any questions, I can get live Amazon help very promptly!"
love this. Pictures are clearer and can do many things.
Perfect tablet.
Love it. Use it every day.
Seems to be fine.  Have not had time to figure it all out.  No instruction book.  Bummer
My kids love their new Fire HD 7 Kindles!
Enjoy the kindle very much. Handy to grab and pretty easy to use. Whole family likes it.
"I already had an 8.9&#34; Fire HD and have enjoyed it immensely. I was considering the purchase of a Kindle Paperwhite as it is much lighter and easier to read a book from.  Then my wife received the Fire HD 7 in a raffle at work, along with a Fire TV Stick. She presented both to me and I downloaded my library to the Fire HD 7 and found it light, easy to use when I am reading in bed and find it a great addition. I have gifted the Paperwhite to several family members in recent months and they have absolutely loved them, however the Fire HD 7 offer so much more and still has the light weight making it a great option for the avid reader who still requires internet access and use of various apps."
"After using an old Kindle for years, this neat bright screen is great. A lot of new things to do online and off. Thanks."
Works great love it for movies
Love it....started to buy ipad...but glad I didn't. Hoping this will come out in a 10 inch...will buy a new one then.
"Everything as advertised with no surprises, just the way I like! Got her real quick in superb condition."
"Great device for the price, exceeded expectations. Fast shipping via Amazon Prime"
Very powerful!
great product
"It is great! I love all your kindles, the only tablet I have ever wanted to own!"
"I am an unapologetic Android user and The Kindle Fire is one of the best tablets (e-readers) on the market for browsing the internet, watching videos and straight up reading a book.  It is intuitive, user friendly and  faster than last year's model.  The new interface makes it easy to share apps, books etc. between family members, each family member can create a personalized profile for all their preferences.  Now it also allows sharing between Kindle Fire devices.  I'm really hooked on the whole Amazon ecosystem, so I'm perfectly happy using the app store, but those that use Google Play specific apps will miss Instagram, Dropbox and other apps. not found in the Amazon store.  I keep upgrading and giving the old one to a family member.  Now my whole family has one and sharing content is very convenient.<br /><br />I bought the first version of the Fire in 2011.  It is still running, the software can be upgraded and it is awesome, my daughter uses it everyday.  I also have the first generation Ipad in 2010 - the operating system can only be upgraded to 5.1.1 - NOTHING runs on it anymore.  It is a glorified TV screen, and even at that I can't download the TV apps like Showtime anytime or HBOGo. It cost 3x as much as the Kindle Fire and yet it is already obsolete."
Great for my boys ages 7 & 5. They like taking pictures with the camera and watching movies on it! I like that it comes in different colors and for $79.00 it was an awesome price! The only thing I would change is that there would be more storage space.
What a Timely gift; perfect birthday surprise and I am speechless.
Genuinely sorry I waited this long to get the Fire HD kindle.  It has bigger type and better graphics than my first two kindles.  With this one I might even begin to enjoy watching videos?
I love it .
This was an upgrade from my first fire I have had for several years now.  It is great for my travel entertainment needs.
"I already had an IPAD, iPhone, regular basic Kindle and I wanted to see what this could do for me. I love it! It's almost like a computer in a little container. I can access internet, email, movies, videos, camera, photos, etc. and the main reason I bought this was to read books. I liked looking up books on the IPAD because it was in color but I liked reading them on the basic Kindle because it was smaller and easier to hold. This is the best of both worlds. Now I can look for books in color AND read on the same device because it is small enough to do this. The clarity of the videos and photos is excellent also. Its also easier on the eyes than a small iPhone! I highly recommend this for the cost and features!"
Just what I wanted and met all of my expectations. This is my second Kindle but first Fire and I love the product.
This was totally worth the price!  My first kindle........don't know how I lived without it!
Absolutely all as advertised
Couldn't pass up purchasing the Fire at a great price.  Adds another option for internet apps.
I love it.
"Using mostly for reading books - but nice to have the wi-fi options, as well.<br />Wonderful tablet for my basic needs.<br />Thanks to Amazon for a winning product."
I replaced my regular Fire with the HD Fire w/camera.<br />I'll do the negative first.  the battery will only last about 6-8 hrs before it will need to be recharged or plugged in.<br />The positives...clear sharp screen. Love the sharp pictures it takes. But they are fuzzy when telephoto'd (zoomed in).
"Going from the original Kindle to the Fire HD 7 is going to take a bit of getting used to. I love that it is compact and can be easily carried with me while traveling, and is also pretty easy to navigate,  without having  to be a techie, but I hate the screen savers and I am hoping there is a way around them so that I can use my own. Since I really only use the Kindle for reading I am very happy that I upgraded-- old kindle still works fine but didn't have a back-light (the external light was not very sophisticated looking while out in public lol) but it served me well. I would recommend buying or upgrading to the Kindle Fire HD."
"I use it a lot,, Easy to learn ,,, Only thing is I don't know  what apps I get  with it ."
Excellent product.  Clear crisp screen.  Perfect for streaming movies!
"I like the color and the Kindle, especially the extra storage space. My only dislike is that it does not pair with Bluetooth devices with microphones and that sucks."
Love it...
Awesome good for carrying to work and travel fits in the smallest purse I have
Screen clear slightly smaller than expected
Ok so far
love it!!
I was really disappointed with this product. It works fine but I am a WordSearchBible user.  And in fact the reason I purchased the Fire HD was because of my desire to use it with WordSearchBible.  I am quite disappointed to discover that the two don't communicate and I have lost my money on this thing.
Love it but the battery lifesucks
It is a good replacement for my nook which had hit the floor one time too many.  Was a bit disappointed that I didn't get the larger one...but this one is great.
Love this little thing!
Pretty nifty.  Lots of neat things.  Still figuring it out.
I've owned it for about a month and am still learning how to use all the features.  Battery doesn't seem to last very long.
This fire hd 7 is faster and better than my kindle hd
User friendly. Simple to learn. Excellent resolution
The service was just fine. I was well please.
Excellent
"I've always considered myself a fairly good manager of my time, but this gadget finds me wondering where the time went. Overall, I'm am quite impressed with the Fire HD 7...especially the stereo speakers."
"I got a gift certificate for my birthday and this seemed like the prefect fit. I was looking for a tablet and this fit the bill. The picture is great and the wifi is fast. The only drawback I've found so far is that some apps don't work on it, like Instagram. I found a way around it but still. Also I write scripts and I have yet to figure out how to get PDF files from my e-mail into my book library. Beyond that my biggest problem, is that it does almost everything my iPhone does, I just need to remember that I can do all of that from my fire now."
I lost my first Fire HD7 and got this one as a replacement. Still love it!!! And so worth the money!!!!
Love it
It ok I have iPad mini but this is good though
It's a good product at a reasonable price. But it will be perfect if the screen resolution can be higher.
Love it
No complaints! Great price & product!!
I like it at this time. Have been having freeze ups during game play.
So far I am very pleased with the Fire HD7.  It meets all of my needs and requirements.
It is great!!
"Love It..!!<br />I received a Kindle as a Christmas gift a few years back, and between me and my Grandsons it had been used almost everyday.  I think we all wore it out!!  It quit working,  its one thing I just can't live without, so I just received my new Kindle Fire, I Love Love Love it.  Thanks Amazon for such Fast Great Service!!"
I Love it more than I expected!!! I can do everything I wanted to be able to do. P.S. Love the Color!
"I love it. I have an older version that I set up for my 4 year old, giving the leap pad (which I will never buy again) to her 2 year old brother.  This kindle is thinner and not as heavy as my previous kindle, which took a little getting used to. It almost seemed flimsy in comparison, but it isn't flimsy at all. I managed to have a clumsy day and dropped it several times, without a case. No dings, no scratches, nothing. I bought a case, just to be safe. The external volume control is a big improvement over what I had before as well. Mostly, I read. And this is great for that. Easy settings, including an optional adjustment for digital books that makes it easy on the eyes. And it works, I could feel the difference immediately, subtle, but such a huge difference. The set up felt more streamlined as well, with toddlers parental controls are a big thing for me, once I registered this kindle it knew what setting I had on the old and just took me there (with my permission) to set them up on this one as well. Very simple and quick in comparison. I take it everywhere. The game and few videos I've seen on it are clear and sharp, speakers are good, for what they are, I tend to use headphones if I watch something on it, but I rarely watch anything unless the kids are asleep.  Camera is fine, about the same as the one on my phone. But again, not something  I use a lot. With all.the apps and WiFi, it has boundless potential."
I love being able to read books and also access the internet and my e-mail.
Perfect size and amazing display clarity. I have a 10&#34; tablet and the Fire is more functional due to the better size.
I love it!
"I have bought Kindles for 4 of my grandchildren. They are durable (we do have them in &#34;kid cases&#34;) and easy for them to use. I love that I can subscribe to the Free Time for them and they can share apps and books. This newest one is a little lighter and faster than previous versions. Because there is a parental control with Free Time, I don't worry about too much screen time. They use them to listen to music and watch TV and movies as well as using apps and reading. I have found Amazon to have awesome customer service over the years also. My grandchildren that use Kindles range in age from 4 to 13 and they all enjoy them. As far as battery life, we are in the habit of plugging them in overnight on the days they use them and seldom run into low battery problems."
"Bought this to replace the version that had no camera.  Works great, I'm happy with it."
I love my new Fire!!!
"Excellent device! Received this kindle as a birthday gift from my loved ones. Just when you think they have reached their peak with the kindle, I'm totally blown away with this latest offering. Hey it's kindle time!"
Bought this for my husband.  To date he has only had the chance to look at this kindle.  The improvements are wonderful.  Use the timer daily and will have much more use for this newer model.
It's a great device love it as much as my previous  kindle fire
"Love,love it"
Love it. Much faster than my first gen Kindle. User friendly interface and good integration of multiple e-mail accounts.
Perfect once I figured out how to use it. LOL
I absolutely love it!!! Not only did I get it for a great price but it performs exactly as I had hoped. I am especially happy with the ability to view on my Amazon Instant videos on a tablet. Definitely a smart purchase.
"i am still working on it , but so far everything is perfect, very happy with the Fire HD 7."
my husband loves it!!!!!!!!!
Love my tablet I will upgrade soon!!!!!!!
First tablet for my husband. Its easy for him to learn.
"I could not find any better than the Fire tablet. It is a solid, and fast and the best it is the price. I love it."
Love it
Disappointed that viewing the screen outside is so difficult. Would be better if screen background could be reversed in daylight
"Love it.  I had the first edition of the Kindle and this HD 7 is so much better and more user friendly.  Also, the price was far less than I paid for my first Kindle."
Awesome!!!!!!!
It was beyond my expectations.  I love it!
"Very fast to load and move from one window to another.<br />Screen is amazingly clear but gets fingerprints very easily.<br />Easy to use but some things just dont load well.<br />For the price, its a super self-gift.<br />Still learning how to use it fully."
Everything I knew it would be. Great display. Am going to hook it up to my smart tv in hopes of divorcing from cable. Perfect size too.<br />Mine came in blk instead of cobalt. Not to worry.
awesome!
Very nice 2nd one I've bought.
Love it
It froze. Had to return it.
I also have the original Kindle Fire and there is a dramatic difference between that one and the Fire HD.  Amazon has truly stepped up to the plate and made much-needed improvements in the display and sound quality.  I never even need to use my ear buds anymore!
"It is great except memory is only 4 GB.  To be fair, I have not yet contacted customer service."
Nice display and good speaker.
Getting used to it...think it will be fun. Hard to replace my old kindle keyboard e-reader
Love it!!  I just wish it had The Pulse app. like the first kindle did.
"Its what I expected from amazon, great device."
"I love my new Kindle but a miss a couple of thing from my old model (2nd generation Kindle Fire HD 7).  The HDMI port and the more rounded edges which made it more comfortable to hold.  I would also like to see a SD card slot and a built in mic for voice recognition typing.<br /><br />I bought this one so that I could have one Kindle just for reading and the other for games.  That way, my grandkids can play games when they are over and I can still read.  I actually paid $100 less for my new one than the one I bought over 2 years ago.  Thank you Amazon for the great sale."
"I have and I-pad and wanted to keep my reading books separate.  So far, I am really enjoying my Fire HD."
I purchased it primarily to read me to sleep and it exceeded expectations. For learning content I set to x2 reading speed even when taking a nap.
"Woo-hoo! Great price, perfect size you can do everything. Love it."
Love my kindle! I had the old style Kindle when it first came out and I love the new updates the newer systems have. The app store has so many to choose from and its the perfect size for any reader. The color is crisp and the screen is clear no matter the angle I look at it. I love how my prime account connects to it and allows me to watch my instant videos and borrow books. A must have!
It's a Kindle! But more. I'm stilladjusti g to it from my other tablet. But I'm liking it a lot. Good battery life too.
First I would like to say I've had a Kindle for about five tears and loved having it just a reader but I could use text to speech  with it. Unfortunately it broke  I needed a new reader so I bought a paper white very nice but after I got home and looked at it there was no headphone jack  after some research I found the only way to get text to speech was with an Amazon fire  I bought it am very disappointed didn't want all that stuff  don't need it weighs too much and doesn't hold a charge just wanted a reader with text to speech I hope a person from Amazon sees this what are the chances!
Better than advertise
"Hubbs loves it - very please, better than my Kindle from last year LOL (should have traded it out!!)<br />front and back camera - very sturdy, he is pleased with his new toy and all the apps that it can get (spent the first day just loading like 100 apps, then had to go back and 'weed' them out because he ran out of room!!)"
Did not disappoint.
"I had the original fire  and loved it. My husband said I could get the new one for Mother's Day if I gave him my old one. Never a question in my mind. Love the new one even more. Picture pops out to you, sound is good and download is quick"
Nice affordable and easy to use tablet.  It replaces my 1st generation iPad - and I am glad I made the switch!
Best tablet i have had!!
"I guess I didn't read the little print.  I wanted to download designs and hook the ipad to my sewing machine.  Now I find that I can not do this.  My fault, but I was still disappointed."
I like it because it is easy to use. And an upgrade from my tablet.
I love the kindle fire... This is my second. I'm set
"I have one of the early kindle fires and am just as happy with this one!  Probably would not have paid full price (since my old one still works just fine--definitely like the longevity of Amazon items), but $79 daily deal I could not resist.  I like that I can now put collections in my favorites since I do a lot of our homeschool with my device.  This way I don't have to weed through all of my other books to find what I need.  I also like the reading list on the browser page and am using it similarly by separating all recipe items there and using bookmarks for everything else.  I like the durable feel, yet still lightweight."
Love my tablet
The kindle fire HD is perfect.<br />I received it quicker than the delivery date and love the cover as well.<br />Thank you
"It has a very sharp display,and works well for what I wanted. I have a Kindle, but I like the fire better for reading books. I bought it when it was on special for $79, so I think it was a great deal."
"3 stars because I am not sure if I received a well-built kindle fire hd7 at this time. Here is the reason for my concern. I noticed that the back cover seems to be too loose. It is visibly noticeable, and when pressed it has quite a bit of play meaning it moves. Will this cause performance or functionality problems in the future? I don't know; therefore I am not at liberty to give it 5 stars at this time because this is a heavy concern for me.<br /><br /> Amazon, should I be concerned about my new purchase? Is this a red flag?"
"Description,and what came with the FireHD7 was a great help when deciding on my purchas"
"I love it!  I'm still learning, but enjoy what I know now."
"The device works as promised and was a great value for the money. The only improvement I could suggest would be the ability to install Google apps like Gmail, since it is based on Android."
I love this kindle it does work great and it's my 2nd one I upgraded from the original one it is so much better. Until we had are first fall and my screen broke I have seen the tv ads on there testing for the new improved screens so I didn't think anything about taking it out.then it falls off my lap and hits the ground and it's broke
I am really happy with it Got a good deal
By far the best operating system for the best price.  Easy to operate and is the right size to take any where.
"Works great. internet is fast, HD picture is beautiful. The only negative part is that the charging cord is so short and this doesnt come with any accessories, not even a complimentary screen protector. Everything else about this product is great."
Great ☺
I love it. Works exactly as described.
My third kindle fire. They just get better all the time.
My girls love them
"In mid-April 2015, Amazon offered the 16GB Fire HD 7 for the terrific price of $99.  I purchased the tablet for the sole purpose of downloading Amazon Prime video content, and I am very pleased with this feature.  The tablet itself is rather thick and heavy, and the colored plastic backing makes the tablet feel cheap, but the display is clear and sharp.  In my opinion, the &#34;carousel&#34; feature is an unpleasant way to display content. However, at $99 for a 16GB tablet, I am satisfied with my purchase, and I love being able to download Prime video content."
"Nice so far...looking for a cover, without much progress."
Returned.  Not at all what I was looking for.  Wanted another tablet to be able to install a game my grandson wanted only to find out the Kindle was not compatible with the game.  Ended up with an LG tablet.
"Not at all intuitive; I am fairly proficient with techology, but most of the time could not even get out of the kid's ware section.  We ended up returning both the units that we purchased and will purchase iPads.  Disappointing."
Excellent performance with great graphics.
Nicely made
Great tablet!
"I bought this, thinking I might return it, I didn't. I can't. I love it."
Great device. Good purchase!
It is easy to work with and will let me do what I wanted to do with it.
"Way more than just a kindle, great little tablet, great definition while watching videos. Loved it, amazing product at amazing price."
"Very happy with all the features and capabilities. Ideal for avid readers and movie buffs. They do need to reduce the weight a bit and increase the duration of the battery charge. Also, would be nice if calendar and contacts could sync with outlook. Maybe next version."
"I wish it had the wifi internet option, but I need the rear facing camera more. The price was perfect, reading .pdf files and listening to music works perfectly."
"The new Fire HD is great. I have a 3 and 5 year old and along with a case, these are holding up to the demands of small and reckless little kids. Their weight is also perfect for them. The parental controls are easy to set and several of the apps are fun and simple. And since they are not the &#34;kids&#34; tablets, my husband and I have fun using them as well with a profile set up just for us. They hold a long charge and are wonderful for a car trip. I do recommend headphone (that's a personal preference and has nothing to do with the performance of the tablet)."
"Please reconsider spending your money on any Kindle Fire tablet. For one very simple reason. The browser. The Amazon Silk browser, without question, is the most unreliable browser I have ever had to suffer. I will never make the Amazon tablet mistake again, whether I next purchase an Android or an Apple. Save your money, your time, and the aggravation. Expect terrible customer service if you do attempt to contact Amazon regarding any problem you have with these pieces of junk. Very disappointed and now much wiser Amazon Fire tablet owner."
Love my new Kindle.  It's perfect to take along with you. It's a great value!
my grandson loves his knew tablet it is great.
I'm in love💜 with my Amazon fire HD 7
"Less then what I expected.  I've had the HD 7 for a week and I am already experiencing problems connecting to the web.  The HD7 has Frozen while I was searching for information on the web. I am very disappointed with this purchase.  When reading I can't take advantage of  the back arrow feature because it sends me back to the home instead of the last page I viewed. The back arrow feature was what I liked most about the Kindle Fire it made Bible studying easy.  I liked the Kindle Fire best. There really isn't much difference between the two other then the camera, size, back arrow, and home screen"
Had a first generation kindle so enjoying the updated version
Better than advertised!!!
"So far, I LOVE IT.  It is small, fast, and exactly what I was looking for. I got the Citron color and I love it!"
"I like it, but the camera does not come with flash light. so it make it  nearly impossible to take pictures at night."
"Great product, greater price"
Awesome gift
Love this Kindle Fire.  This is my 4th generation Kindle.  Still have 3 of them and love the fact that this Kindle sync's with my read only Kindle.
Works perfectly.  Easy to set up.  Great birthday present for the daughter.
"This is an ok Tablet, we have owned various Android and Apple products so @ $79 i decided to give it a try. It appears they restrict you from downloading basic apps such as youtube which i find annoying. I bought this mainly to read and as a back up remote for my fire TV so overall its OK."
"It's a song book, it's a library, it's an internet tool, it's a birthday present. My husband loved it so much that I ordered one for myself."
Awesome tablet super user friendly.
love it! everything I was hoping it would be.
"Really, it's 4.5 stars, but I can't post that.<br /><br />I'm loving exploring the features on this new (my second) Kindle, and the options are great.  I was surprised at how heavy it is in comparison to my little Kindle 4, but that's a small price to pay (and so was the actual price, since it was on sale for $79!!)  I do wish the User Guide was more accessible/downloadable, though, and I didn't realize I'd have to be in range of a wifi to use it unless I download something...less access to try the many many new toys and email options since I have wifi access only at work.  Despite these points, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"I have upgraded my kindle several times over the years.  I use it on a daily basis and never have problems, except for the start up always seems to be problematic.  For my newest upgrade, it is the charger or the charging cord not sure which.  I can say that every problem I have ever had with my kindle has always been addressed by the customer service staff to my satisfaction."
I love Amazon tabletsare the best
Very handy and amazing for this price!
Very nice tablet. Easy to use. I highly recommend it.
"Have first generation and this one. Disappointed with battery life. Battery runs down during hibernation. Have 2 iPads as well, when they hibernate battery usage is minimal.<br />Plus side more compact for travel, hdmi accessory better price than apple products.<br />Overall"
"Got 2 of these for my wife and I! They work great, super fast,load movies and games great,love reading on it, and it has the best speakers ever!"
"So far so good-easy to use, great graphics and sound-easy downloads-use for birding apps and works as I was hoping it would!"
"Initially I was in confused state, wether to go for e-book reader or not, I have purchased one of the costliest reader but gave it up due to its weight. But after getting the Fire HD7.7 I was amazed by its design and weight. The design is very impressive (thanks to design team). The kindle app is very simple and no nonsense app, able to read the books very easily.<br />The HD Quality is awesome, After using this device I dumped my laptop, just hanging out with my Fire HD.<br />Thank you very much Amazon, you did a splendid job by releasing the fire HD which sits in my hand very beautifully.<br /><br />Cons : Color, probably my mistake in selection. There is no Red/Space gray/Gold. I would love these."
"A GREAT tablet for such a cheap price. I got mine for $99, and I like it just as much as an iPad. Amazing HD display, fast and good graphics, and a nice size screen. It is also perfect for streaming Netflix or watching YouTube. My only complaint is that the battery life is a bit short, but that is expected since it is a budget tablet. The picture quality isn't is good as an iPad by far, but again, that is expected because it's a budget tablet. All in all, I highly recommend the Kindle Fire HD 7 to anyone who is looking for a new and affordable tablet!"
Love this item!
Got this one for my mom and she absolutely loves it.
"The Kindle Fire commercials that Amazon is running on their television commercials about the Kindle being tough no matter how you drop it, is a flat out lie!!!  I had a Kindle Fire a little over a year ago and I drop it aprroximately 3-feet from the floor and the screen went completely black and it would not work again.  I called Amazon support and they would not replace it at all no matter who I spoke to.  I decided to purchase a Samsung tablet from a local store and I have drop that a few times now, not on purpose of course, and it has never failed me.<br /><br />DO NOT BELIEVE AMAZON'S TV COMMERCIALS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, THEY ARE COMPLETELY UNTRUE!!!!  Amazon needs to pull these ads immediately and stop their false advertising!!!!"
The tablet is great. However the battery life is awful.
"Although the screen is small, the video and the audio are clear and crisp. I love sitting in bed at night at watching old television series that I was too busy to watch when they first aired."
Amazon is amazing
"Easy to learn, user friendly. Like the availablilty to WiFi so I can access email, fb when I am away from home. Nice size, light weight."
It's nice for the price. It's all you really need for a tablet. The camera is not that grate but everything else is perfect. Hd is nice
Awesome tablet!!!
I did not like the shipping it was too slow ...I wish it could be more faster
"I love my Kindle's.  I don't care for the new browser though on my new Kindle HD 7&#34;.  If you are down scrolling and need to back up, the browser from the top of the page releases and falls down over the print you are trying to read.  Then you need to back up or down again and the browser becomes temperamental and does this &#34;jerk&#34; movement.  I tried to unsuccessfully bring it to the attention of an Amazon tech.  but got no where.  I wish they had not changed the browser. I give 4 stars because of the browser problem. It's miserable!"
Does not always respond to touch of stylus.
Loved it!
Excellent.
Very good Tablet
Like camera feature
Blown away by every aspect of this tablet... picture quality...sound... features...ease of use!  Wish I'd ordered with the larger storage capacity... I no longer have any need of my laptops!
"I am very impressed with my new Fire HD. The functionality is outstanding. The only thing I like better about my other HD is the tapered edges, that's just a small thing. Over all I would recommend the Fire HD7 time anyone."
great product wife loves it
So much faster than my old Kindle. I love this thing and take it everywhere.
Love the price and it works great.
"We are incredibly disappointed with this device, which partly reflects how psyched we were to get it, but also reflects its appallingly short battery life (like, left OFF on the bed during the day, goes from 100% to 50% -- unless we've got poltergeists, I can't imagine how that's happening) and difficulty to use. Considering returning it and getting another Nook HD instead, that's how bad it is. We can't easily change profiles, can't download music from our Prime library, can't read books I've bought *and* downloaded. It's just awful; maybe I got a defective one."
This was my first kindle device that I bought in 2013.  I love this device for the doing music sound. In 2014 I purchased the Kindle HDX 7&#34; and the display and shouted are remarkable. For those of you who prefer better sound quality I would stick with the Kindle Hd 7&#34; if you mainly want music and internet email surfing. The sounds quality is not as good on the HDX For some reason..For grad school my HDX had plenty of space for my online books cc and is great for watching videos. I love the 7&#34; because I can fit it in most if my purses<br />Dee Dee McGowan
Very good quality. Just what I needed to play games. It is a computer and tablet all in one.
The item has excellent clarity on the screen.  The only change I made was a screen protector.  This reduced the glare off the screen.
its a great device
I'm pleased with my new Fire.
Love my Kindle Fire!!!!
"I have seldom been as disappointed in a product:<br />Two reasons NOT to buy:<br /><br />1) This thing comes with ads. That's right ads.  The first thing you see when you turn on your awesome beautiful machine is an Oreo commercial in HD.  And I can pay $15 to make that go away.  Nickel and dimed into hating a brand.  I really can't believe it.  Since they had a sale on their own product they now use that as an excuse to show ads.  &#34;Here Mom!  Happy Mothers Day! Just swipe right past that commercial on to the front screen.  Oh and you can't personalize the backgrounds.  Or if you can, hell if I can figure out how without consulting multiple boards&#34;<br /><br />2) Even worse than ads... this is not easy to navigate.  I got this for me mom and quickly realized that she would not be able to figure it out.  I had to sit at the laptop and try to find help screens to figure out how to navigate this thing.  And I didn't find much help.  This is complicated by the ads and the content pushing which is overboard.<br /><br />My 13-year-old nephew would view youtube all day on this and probably love this.  For a senior, it's a terrible product since it's hard to navigate and for an 11-or-under-year-old it's terrible given all the clickbait.  And I personally as a regular adult find it really annoying.<br /><br />I have an Amazon FireTV stick and have been an Amazon prime member for years.  And this product makes me sad.<br />I will be returning mine"
Extremely versatile. GREAT resolution. Lots of apps. Great buy for $99.
I had the kindle fire and just wanted to upgrade I'm happy with it I also brought my Mom one
I Absolutely Love this device.  It's like having a mini i-Pad; however the Fire HD 7&#34; charges faster than my sister's i-Pad.  The screen resolution is AWESOME!
Absolutely love the Fire HD. It is a perfect size to carry wherever you go.
I love my kindle fire. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read and be on the internet. It does everything you need a tablet to do.
"For the price, you can't beat it. I picked up this bad boy to read digital comics and watch instant flicks. It crushes it.<br /><br />Pros.<br />For basic tabulating (reading comics, YouTube, e-mail) it rules. Great screen for the price. WiFi works great.<br /><br />Cons.<br />It's a little cheap feeling, but for $100 and change, come on! The OS is a little janky.<br /><br />Five stars, if you can get it on sale."
"I love this! The colors are vivid, it doesn't crash and I have had no problems at all.  I have owned two other tablets and they constantly had problems, the Fire has been the best and I highly recommend it!"
Love them! These were for my grandchildren and they spend hours on them - primarily for learning. We enjoy Amazon Free Time.
Very nice tablet for the price.
Great little toyq
Love my Kindle Fire!
"bought this after buying one for my wife to read books, but I have a prime membership so tried it for movies and was impressed with the<br />quality of the movies and kindle"
"The Fire is on fire!! It's an awesome tablet, especially at its low price. I use it to read and to stream movies from my Synology server."
Great product. It arrived when promised.
"This is my 2nd Fire...so far so good.  Love the quality of the screen and it's lighter, and fast.  The charger looks like it will go the distance (which was the issue with the first).  Use it primarily for books and love being able to access my library wherever I am/go."
"I love my kindle. This is the first tablet I actually purchased for myself. I wanted something not oo bulky, but large enough to use with ease..this is perfect."
Works great
Excellent
"I have a Kindle that I have had for over 3 years, and I like this one better than the new one. It is slow, and some of he apps can not be used."
Enjoy it.
This was a gift for my great granddaughter who is 6 years old.  She loves playing all the games.
Received kindle fire hd 7 16g today. Spent $99 on an amazon prime deal and got a $50 gift card to longhorn steakhouse sent with it as a gift from amazon. I'm very happy with the awesome deal I received. Picture is very clear and the kindle seems very well constructed.
"Love it! Wish the abc app worked on this model, but hopefully it will be updated. Everything else is great."
Everything I expected.  Great buy
One word to describe it AWESOME !
Everything that was expected! My son loves it!!
"I love this tablet.It is just the right size and the cobalt is a very nice color.<br />The picture quality is great,crisp and bright,better than my desktop computer.<br />I would have given it 5 stars except the battery life seems to wear down quickly and a couple of the game apps freeze every once in a while.<br />Overall though it is something I would recommend especially in this price range.<br /><br />Update-I am still enjoying using this but I am disappointed on how quickly the battery life runs out. I have to charge it up every day.Playing games will run the battery down with about 3 hours of use."
Excellent
Still getting used to ir
"I am very happy with my new kindle. This is my 4th one I am never disappointed!  I wanted a small kindle to take with me since I have the larger one.  I could not live without my kindle. But being a prime member I was disappointed that I was supposed to get my kindle in 2 businesses days, it  took over a week!"
For the price a good value. Android software cannot compare with IOS
Light and easy to use. Charge it up and go
It's everything I would have liked and more. I get to try some things that I would have to wait a month or two to try on other systems.
bought this for the hubby!
This is our 2nd one.  Love it
My first kindle!  I've been through three of a different brand in three years and gave up.<br />I like the ease of use for most features but am severely disappointed with the battery life. Reading requires recharge every 2-3 days but if I use Internet or play a game(not even an RPG!) the Fire needs charging daily!!
"Works great, the price is excellent."
Awesome tablet awesome price. My son loves it
I love my Kindle!! It is the best gift I have ever received.
Love the better graphics.
#loveit
Great...
Still learning. But great display at a good price point
I received this as a gift. It is much lighter and has newer software than my Fire HD (1st gen).
"The on and off button is hard to work. It is flush with the case, it is not raised."
"Love it, still getting used to the changes, I'm glad it came at 79% charged so I could set it up right away. It came earlier than expected. I bought it to use with the Amazon register and card sweeper. Nice sound, glad it has audio reading and sound buttons on the side. Thanks for including the dual plug right away without having to spend more. Easy set up."
"Terrible battery drain,had less than a week only reading and watched the battery drain one percent every 6 mins.Called support they walked me thru  what I already knew and had done. Still have the older kindle works great just wanted to update but did not read reviews before buying or would have seen the issues that people were having with battery drain. I have other tablets to use the amazon app on that are not a drain like the kindle. I would not buy this until amazon fixes this, there is to many other tablets that can be used for reading that do not have this issue."
Not received yet.  Should be just as great as it's predecessors.
"Good, except for one of the reasons I got my tablet was to get Next Issue, an online magazine service - and now something has changed and I can't get that on my table anymore. It is as if I had purchased a car from GM, and then 9 months later some men come from GM and take the bumpers off and, gee, it no longer has bumpers. Being able to get Next Issue was a feature that moved me to purchase this device in the first place.<br /><br />This is really disturbing and frustrating."
It crap
This is a great item!  We bought one 5 years ago and its still running strong but we wanted to update and it's worth it!  It does take some getting used to with the parental controls I added but very well worth it.  There are so many games the kids can play both fun and educational.  We added the $7 a year game up-grade and sit and play some of them together as a family.  I use and ipad at work and would pick the Kindle Fire over the ipad always!
Timely delivery and great device
MY 2ND FIRE HD TABLET!
My HD shipped faster than expected and it was a great deal for the price. I got it to facebook and watch videos on the plane so its definitely a great investment!
"Much better than my old keyboard model , like the touch screen and color."
Excellent!!! It is exactly what I wanted.
Love it!
"I love it, all of my books were pre-loaded :) and I can read in the dark now!!!  So glad I upgraded."
"Unbelievable price for $79! I have downloaded a lot of music (which I can also listen to on my TV using Fire TV Stick), a few games and some books.  Battery time is great.  So glad I was able to find this great deal!  Would highly recommend."
"Better than my first fire, but no .net Bluetooth,sound and camera are good,picture great"
Im happy
recvd fire hd 7 today did not have the 5w power adapter inth pkg.pls send to william a curry...
Very good !
My wife loves it
Love It.
It is so nice to get a device all ready to go and it works perfect.
I love it.  It replaced one that I had.
"Okay, so I came from the Kindle Fire.  Not the Fire 5&#34; HD, not even the Fire HD.  My kindle is from the era when the Fire HD was just coming out:<br /><br />FIrst thoughts?<br />This is insane!  It's light, and unlike its (generationally old) predecessor, it has a textured back, bevelled edges, all the great things that slabs have learned a lot about.<br /><br />Long story short?  It's a joy to hold.  It's barely-there weight-wise, which is amazing, and the textured back makes it easy to balance in one-hand without a strong grip.<br /><br />It's also insanely responsive.  This is probably due to my comparatively old-tech Fire, but OMG, does this thing burn rubber.  If you have the old Fire, click something now.  This time you're using to read while whatever the hell you clicked loads?  It doesn't exist on the HD 7&#34;.  Responsive is something it does.  The one area this isn't a massive technological leap forward over the Fire is plain downloads.  Videos, Apps, etc might be marginally faster to install, but it's hard to tell.  They're close to the same amount of time they used to take"
Happy
"The worst purchase I've made in decades. Where to begin? It's is a pretty little thing. The display is alright when it works. However, sometimes it takes several hours to boot up. I turn it on and just as often as not it doesn't work. One symptom is after it shows the Amazon logo the fire logo just sits there. Sometimes the animation works, sometimes it doesn't even do that. That can go on for hours. If I get past that stage the log in screen might show and it might not. When it does, before I can even swipe to unlock it, the confounded thing turns off and starts booting all over again.<br />Ok, let's say I am fortunate enough to get past the log in and am playing a game for example, pick one, any one. they all have frozen  and stopped working. This just should not happen. I've tried to get rid of some of the apps. They magically reappear with their advertising and malfunctions. My particular Fire is probably the bad apple, but I can't stand the *&@?!! thing. It's aggravating and frustrating. That others are thrilled to the point of purchasing more than one is mind boggling to me. Buy this at your won risk!"
Love it
"It's a good device. My wife had one, so I knew I'd like it. Works as good as her first one. I MEANT to have gotten the white one, but that was my bad, not their's."
I love it
Love my Kindle.  It is eveything and more than I expected.
This is a neat device.  I think it will serve as an ereader and also replace my IPad.It seems sturdy and durable.  I bought a cover for it and I highly recommend that you buy a cover when you buy it.
"Being my first tablet, I am quite pleased with it. Wanted to stay with Amazon platform being a Prime member vs. another brand with Google platform - I think it just makes sense."
So far so good.
This is a nice tablet for the price. We have only used it for couple weeks now but I like it :)
Easy to use and works great.  Availability of apps could be better
Awesome tablet. My wife really enjoyed having it. I will by another without a second thought!!
"It's great!,"
"I love my new Fire HD 7! My new pal goes mostly everywhere I go, along with my knitting, wallet and keys, and it has given me an opportunity to catch up on my reading, email and my favorite &#34;Masterpiece&#34; episodes."
My boys love their kindle fires!
"Got it at a good price. Good hardware, terrible OS. You can't use Google Apps and don't have access to Google Play... meaning all that money spent in Google Play apps is worth absolutely nothing in Fire OS. Not cool. At. All."
Seems like I can't stay away from this tablet lol and I Loved the color.
No substantial difference from the HD6. There is no noticeable difference in the screen size and I expected a longer lasting battery which this version did not offer. This is my fourth Kindle and I expected more
I tried a different tablet but sent it back! I love my kindle fire!
"I bought this Kindle for my nephew's ninth birthday. He LOVES it! I can't keep him off of it so I made him download learning games too. I hooked it to my account so I could watch everything he is doing with it. He ran out of room the first day because he tried to download a hundred games but I figure he can live with a smaller memory tablet. All he has to do is delete a game to download another. I actually have a Kindle HDX and this new Fire HD is better than mine! It has a front and rear camera, which comes in handy when you want to take pictures and make videos when you don't have your cell phone charged. I purchased a generic case and screen protector with it because, you know, he's nine. He hasn't had any problems with it at all."
They have worked out so far
"The more I use this tablet the more restricted I feel and disappointed I become. I even bought this at a heavily discounted rate of $100 and don't feel like its worth that. For starters, it does not offer Instagram or Snapchat- two of the most popular social media apps for young millennials. Many popular apps aren't available on Amazon's platform- those two just seem like staples to me and you can't even get them! You also can't install background photos without installing an app that overrides the Fire's settings- I realize this is a minimal issue in the grand scheme of things, but come on! The ability to customize the background of an electronic device has been standard since 2004. It also frequently drops the WiFi signal when streaming any music or shows making it very frustrating- I don't think the antenna is very strong. I have always been an Apple person but wanted to see what Amazon had to offer for an e-reader/tablet but I've been sadly let down. I am most likely going to return an get the original kindle just for reading. Or maybe I'll pay up and get an iPad already...."
"Great durable product, but storage is minimal. If you rent movies from amazon for your flights be ready to downgrade the quality of the movie so it fits on the device."
This tablet is awesome!!!<br />I bought it last Christmas for my wife and she loves it..<br />the picture quality and sound is amazing... You can't beat it...
WAY faster than my previous Kindle! Love it.
Excellent device.
Love it!
it meets all my expectations
great price
"As a replacement for my previous Fire (touch screen died) it is perfect. My only complaint is that Amazon would not &#34;ship&#34; me the screen protector nor the extended warranty, saying that they could not ship those to the Virgin Islands. Not sure how an extended warranty would be &#34;shipped&#34;."
"I bought this kindle for my wife.  She thought she wouldn't get much use out of it because of its size. She assumed there would be severe usage limitations compared to her PC.  She and her new Kindle 7 are slowly become good buddies though.  I'm sold on the device.  I've had a kindle now for a couple of years.  They are durable, reliable, and the size makes it easy to take almost anywhere with you, unlike a bulky laptop."
Love it!
"I have a Kindle, a Kindle Reader and now the Fire HD 7, all have met my expectations and represent money well spent."
"Like the new size, and added upgrades.  Still getting used to using it."
I love it! So glad I bought this.
It was as advertised but I had to get a 2nd Fire because the camera did not operate. However<br />the Help provided by Amazon performed very well and when the camera could not be fixed they Fedexed a new one the next day. All is just fine now.
Well worth the price. .
Much better than my old (gen 1) Kindle Fire. Very happy so far.
Left my original FireHD in plane last Sept.  Order second one and love it.
It was everything expected.  My 11 year old loves and I love the the parental controls.  We chose Kindle Fire just for that purpose.  As a parent I love that it can just be reader and then apps with time limits are available on an as needed basis.
"I love my new Kindle. So far no problems and runs smoothly. I love that you can take things off the carousel, but not the device. I love that there's a home or favorite's under the carousel so I can easily access anything I really want."
I turned it on and it told me I  had to restore it. I just got it and it telling me to restore it? I brought other Kindles from Amazon and never had to restore it as soon as I turned it on for the first time. I wonder if I got a new one as I paid for or a used one?
Awesome device
Took a little long.
"If you're looking for a paper weight, this would be it.  It's pretty useless and every app and anything to do cost money or you find out that you are under a subscription that you didn't know about.  Buyer Beware!!!  They just try to steal your money, purchase a tablet like an iPad so you know what you are getting."
"I love my kindal fire HD. Works great. Its lighter than my last kindal. Price was fantastic. So easy to use, and had a few new options. Much quicker than the last addition."
"For those of us who basically want a reader, this has proved annoying.  In addition the camera, which was the only extra I thought would be fun, isn't very good."
Very good quality. Sound is amazing.
"Good unit for the price. Unable to easily download my contacts from aol, nor is there the ability to activate a sound alarm when emails are received. Other than this it meets my expectations."
iPad who?  I love my Fire!
I like the weight and size of the tablet. I don't like how if you barely move it it rolls to the horizontal or vertical size and you lose your focus. I also have an old tablet that is slow in downloads and when I order books from amazon kindle it says it is downloading and then I never find it and when I go to order the same book it tells me I already have it on my tablet.Then I went to my tablet I bought from you and it downloaded fast. So now I can read the second book of the series. This one is easier to erase already read books. Thank you.
I love it. Can't wait to build my library and enjoy reading again.
Moved up from Kindle Fire. Works so much better!!
I love it!  It's exactly what I expected and needed.
I love the size and the clarity of the screen
Still a novice on this product so I don't feel right commenting other than the book I read was easy to read.
I absolutely luve this HD 7&#34; .. I got it on sale and it is worth every penny! Guys but his item!
I love my Kindle Fire HD 7.  I use it mainly for watching videos.  The display and sound are great.
Very happy with the new fire had.
I just love it.
"I wish I had known that this edition is not compatible with flash player and certain other apps that just can't be loaded onto this device.  I have tried many times to load a different browser that could support flash and a video chat app but no luck.  So, in conclusion, I would not have purchased this even though it was a good price.  Just a bit disappointed in the kindle product now."
The HD 7 kindle arrived on time and in good shape.  The HD kindle fire has a noticeable better quality picture than the regular kindle.
"So far so good. I still love my Toshiba Thrive, but I do like how light it is and the apps. I am excited to find out what this thing can do. :)"
Love the speed and crispness or the hd screen
"I have 2 Kindles and LOVE them but I purchased this one after seeing the new commercials on how tough they are and do not break (the one where it is on the roof of the car and woman slams on breaks, the kindle flips and flops onto driveway but doesn't break); I gave this Kindle to my 9 year old son for his birthday and 2 days later the screen shattered when he dropped it in the house."
"Had 1st generation that was still working, so didn't feel justified in ordering new one. However, the price was right on this one (a one-day special). Glad I bought it! This version has so much more! Since I had already &#34;passed&#34; the learning curve on first one, it was a breeze. There are short How To's with arrows to walk you through if you need it. Speakers are so much better, and like that the on/off button is at top instead of bottom."
It is much heavier to hold than other tablets its size. It freezes and malfunctions at least once a day or more. I also didn't realize when it said it comes with &#34;special offers&#34; that it meant it comes with constant adds. I Igor it for my daughter but am not too pleased she has to look at constant commercials. I think I will be sending it back.
It has limitations.  Apps do not work very well.
"I really like it.  It is a nice size, not too big or too small  The screen is very clear and the resolution is great."
"I got this for $79 and for that price point, I feel it is a pretty good tablet. I have had this for only a day though. Will update periodically.  The good: 1. Nice hardware. 2. Easy to use interface. I already have a Kindle Fire 2012 and just had to connect to Wifi, download my apps from the Cloud and I was good to go in 10 min flat. 3. Sideloaded Dropbox, Viber and other google apps such as Google Drive. Fairly easy to set up. Not able to edit google documents though. Need to find a way around it :-) 4. ES Explorer is an absolute MUST. Connects to all cloud drives and effectively makes the low onboard storage an after thought. 5. Good enough display. I don't use the device much in the sun, so it works just fine for me. 6. Camera is an upgrade from my previous Kindle and I use it mainly for video conferencing. Serves the purpose very well. 7. Connected to a generic bluetooth keyboard easily.  The cons: 1. Opening screen makes it pretty hard to spot the arrow to swipe, but this is because of offers - a problem I knew about beforehand, but still a pain. 2. Need to figure out a way to disable that security feature! 3. Keyboard occasionally vanished and only way to make it reappear was a reboot. I installed a Swype keyboard application from the appstore and I have not seen this issue since. 4. The firmware update process was buggy - a lot of my icons vanished from the carousel and I had to re-start a few times to get it right. 5. Updated firmware is laggy even on the new hardware. 6. Battery life seems to be low. I have charged it 100% and it drains in about 6 hrs. My old Kindle Fire used to last 10 hours.  Update:5/8/15: 1. Figured out how to unlock the security screen. Simple enough :-) 2. Combining profiles worked really well for me and my wife.  Update: 5/18/15 1. Has been horribly laggy. Particularly loading the home screen when exiting an app and vice versa to the point I am considering returning it. 2. Battery life is worse than I had thought."
I'm Pleased with this purchase so far. The battery seems to go quickly but not sure if it's due to many things running or not. Also only one speaker on this items works when music is on not sure if both should..still trying to figire this out. But like it so far.
Great device!
Love my Fire HD 7!!
"Good screen, decent speed.  However, handicapped by the limitation to Amazon market for apps (no google play).  Does what needs to be done well, but nothing more."
On off button more difficult to use.
i love the brightness of the fire
"We splurged on one of these during a recent price drop, figuring it would be a &#34;good-enough&#34; second screen for whoever wasn't using the iPad (a full-size iPad 2). To our surprise, we actually like our Fire better than our iPad, for most everyday uses (watching TV/Movies, web browsing, etc.)<br /><br />The main reason – it's smaller and lighter. We were worried the screen would be too small, but it's just right for hand-held use. Also, the sound is great – better than the iPad for sure. The touch pad is one of the most responsive I've every used – seemingly better than the iPad as well. You also have really easy access to all your Amazon stuff – videos, shopping, books, etc. I've even found the Amazon Firefly app useful.<br /><br />There are some negatives. The available apps are more limited than the Android or Apple App Store, unfortunately. You'll have to check to make sure there aren't any of your &#34;deal breaker&#34; apps missing. All of the most popular apps seem to be there, at least. Certain apps seem sluggish, though (e.g., NBA app.) The hard black plastic body feels cheap; something more &#34;rubbery&#34; (like the back of the old Kindle Keyboard) would have been better. Battery life seems shorter than the iPad.<br /><br />If you're thinking about cutting the cord (canceling your cable) think about this: with this inexpensive tablet and a Netflix/Amazon Prime/Hulu Plus/HBO Now subscription, you can have enough entertainment to last a lifetime in the palms of your hands for SO CHEAP. I was even floored that I could watch great looking live (LIVE!) NBA games on the NBA app (via TNT Overtime.)<br /><br />Overall, this tablet is a joy to use. I can't stress enough how nice it is for the money. Recommended."
Great value for the one day discounted price.
Best bang for the buck . Love how user friendly the fire tablet is and the quality of its parts
I love mine
"The kindle Fire HD 7 is perfect for me. It's been great so far, and couldn't beat the price of 79.99!"
"Good, graphics; sometimes diffult to get back to the home page."
Screen turns off ALL the time for no reason.  No way to fix it.
Love it
I would like to return the whole thing
It's really good. Me and two of my kids have one. The parental settings are great. And I just watched a movie. Im so impressed with the quality of it. Sounded and looked great. The kindle is my favorite tablet by far. They last longer and take a beating and it easy to keep your content between multiple devices. I actually had the very first kindle ereader made and I have been a fan ever since.
"This definitely has better graphics than my previous Kindle Fire, which I loved.  It is faster, too. Only glitch is it sometimes goes to a black screen for no reason.  Also is touchy when turning it on, have to hold the button down just right or won't go on. I gave my husband my old Kindle fire, which was definitely a good move."
Love it!!!
Enjoying it very much!
"Very pleased with my first fire HD works well for me. Not heavy user but can read papers and watch videos, and play games."
Does everything I need in a compact size.
Super buy!
This is the fourth Kindle I've purchased for the family. I've been using a third generation Kindle e-reader and a Kindle fire for more than 3 years. I receive my daily newspaper subscription and thought it was a good time for a replacement. My rationale for buying the Fire HD was the fantastic sale price and concern about the battery longevity on my current devices. I've also noted that my new HD is faster than my wife's Fire HD although she has 16GB. Highly recommend the product.
Do not like where the plug-in and on off button is located....right where the cover straps are.
"So for i,m enjoy singing my kindle hd7.just learning how to use it."
"I wish I had got one that wasn't so &#34;bright&#34; at night, when the lights are out and I'm reading in bed.  But overall I like it."
We were sad that we couldn't replace my husbands last Fire 7 that he had...  But given that he loves this one even more...
This is my first tablet is very user-friendly . It performs tasks fast . I am very happy with it.
I like the new Kindle hd 7......but I absolutely hate the cases! I simple can't find a decent case for it.
Great Mother day gift.
My Daughter loves it!  Especially the camera!
"Great device, but has some shortcomings. You can't upload from the YouTube app. There's no Weight Watchers app. Some things are harder to do than they should be. But my wife loves it - it's the first piece of technology she's ever used that she enjoys!"
Very satisfied.  Met all my expectations.
"My second one, love it!!"
I absolutely hate the built in pop-ups. I refused to pay the ransom to have them removed. If I had known how annoying they are I would purchased something and downloaded the kindle app.
"Very good unit.  For games and web, it does very well.  Picture is<br />grand, sound is tolerable.  But for the price it is 5 stars"
The reason I bought this tablet was because I got tired of using the small screen on my cell phone.<br />I also ssw a presentation of the tablet on one of those home shopping shows which sold me on the HD7. I<br />I am still learning about the tablet as I had some wifi issues in my area but things are now working out. This product will also be shared with another family member.
A little slower than my phone for youtube video but all in all a great gadget.
Love it!!!
Love my kindle fire hd7<br />I can do everything on it like my  PC. But with tge convient of a light weigh compact side tablet that I can take with me anywhere...
I love the Fire but am very unhappy with the short battery charge life. I use the fire for lengths at a time and find it very annoying to have to charge it so often. If there is any way to fix this I would appreciate knowing.
"I haven't yet spent much time with it, but I'M SURE this little device IS incredible! All the potenial it has is fabulous (plus the price is GREAT)."
"seems good, but very lightweight and plastic."
"My HD 7 far surpasses my expectations. Even though I've had it for nearly a month, I'm still discovering features that I didn't know existed, and I am very pleasantly surprised each time. It is very intuitive and easy-to-use and compared to my paper white, It's like trading in my old Plymouth fury for a new Mercedes.<br />You did not give me enough stars for me to accurately rate it. Should have been at least 10."
I am very excited about our new kindle fire HD7.  I have been wanting the kindle with rear camera for some time and was more than excited when I saw it was the deal of the day.  This is the 3rd kindle in our family and I love all of them.  I took some pictures with the new HD 7 and they turned out very nice.  I love all the features on the kindle.  I especially like to read and Amazon has so much to offer in the way of very inexpensive good books!  The kindle is the perfect size when we travel.  It is light and easy to hold.
It's great.
the fire HD 7 was well worth the money.
Absolutely love the kindle but I can't take photos unless I download an app and I just don't have the extra money right now
I just rec'd my Kindle and I am having a lot of fun with it.  I got it on a whim and it has met all my expectations.  Thank you.
Love the color. And the easy of use.
Our son loves it!!
Love it!
"Slow, maybe the CPU needs updates?"
"Ok so this is my first tablet and there are some things i like about and others not so much. Now I already knew that this tablet wasn't gonna take the place of my computer because it's limited, by that I mean.... i can't just plug my usb cable in to my laptop and transfer pictures,music and videos onto this device....Nooooooooooooooooooooo, from what I hear you need some type of app & cable to make that kind of  &#34;magic&#34; happen. Note: You can however buy & download from Amazon's Instant Video and you can upload pictures & videos that you create on your Fire HD7. IMPORTANT : ADJUST YOUR SETTINGS because the pictures & videos take [depending on the setting] could automatically load to the clouds. The built in camera takes low grade pics but that's ok for me because I have a digital camera so that's not a feature I'm really concerned with. Browsing the web is cool and buying games is easy, one click and it's transferred and installed to your tablet [now I love that] !  The sound is excellent  .  The HD experience is crisp & clear . I'm not the social butterfly on the internet and my computers and their content are not community property, so all this &#34;sharing&#34; jive is a bit much not to mention intrusive, that's why I mention the settings [you need to know this]. Oh I can't believe I didn't mention this earlier but the manual [of sorts] is on internet. I don't know I feel like i'm better off figuring it all out myself ! All in all this is a good tablet that you will enjoy. UPDATE: After having this Fire HD for a little over two months i can honestly say that the camera takes far better pictures than i first thought, i think because i was in a badly lit room that that's why it look horrible. Since then I've taken many of outdoors pics and they've came out just fine and they can be made better with the built in photo editor [you can make them HD quality] or you can add text,stickers and some other cool stuff that you can do. You can take screenshots just hold down power & volume down together, it wont take shots of your INSTANT VIDEOS. All in all it's still a great product the rating remains the same.d down power & volume down together, it wont take shots of your INSTANT VIDEOS. All in all it's still a great product the rating remains the same."
"This is the best value in my opinion, and I've had the original $389 Kindle and am on my 3rd $119 Paperwhite.  My stepdaughter bought a Kindle Fire HD7, and even though she owns an iPad, she never touches the iPad after buying the Fire.  After playing with her Fire HD7, I was convinced and promptly returned home and bought one for myself.  I was amazed at all the features right out of the box and love it!  I very seldom use my new laptop anymore.  I can do everything on my HD7."
Arrived right on time and is a great item to have.
"I love the kindle HD7.  However, with the ads, battery drains quickly.  Don't understand the purpose of the ads if everybody ignores it."
"The you tube videos freeze a lot making it difficult to enjoy, other then that it's cool"
So far I do like it but I'm still trying to figure it out.  The on line device support hasn't been a lot help.
"Gift from work, love it!!!!"
"Absolutely love it !!! The fire speakers seem to be louder than my kindle fire 2013, the camera is awesome low mp but takes alright pics in the right light, the touch screen is more receptive than my older kindle, and have no complaints so far...Love my Fire, at such a great price I was able to purchase one for each members of my family, they love it !!! thank you !!!"
I Like it very much.
great tablet
Love it
The Fire HD 7 is a LOT of BANG for your buck.  I love it.
Very pleased with the quick delivery and the upgrades from my Kindle Fire. I'm having fun learning to navigate with the changes.<br />Thank you!
Wow! Very nice! I purchased this to go with my new Amazon Fire phone. Very happy with my purchases. Super nice!
I'm very pleased so far. only have had it a couple of weeks but it is certainly a good upgrade from the first generation fire which is what I had
charging cord is stupid short... otherwise a nice addition to the techno pile..
I. Love it!!!!!
"Great, dependable device!"
"Kind of disappointed. I need more apps. The ones available on the fire quite frankly don't even compare to Google play store for android. There is no way to organize photos and the apps available to do so aren't worth the trouble. So far I spent over $100 (product plus warranty) to play 2 games which isn't even why I bought it.<br /><br />As a couponer,  I need a way to organize photos into albums. I need apps such as walmart, lowes, kmart, etc. I need flipp and favado. This thing is worthless to me without it.<br /><br />Not to mention Firefly NEVER finds an object I point it at. Ugh. What a waste of money."
Great product great price
Great afternoon read! Enjoyed fast pace. Waiting  for #4.....RDN
"It's nice, but different than my previous Fire HD.  It would be nice if you wouldn't keep changing everything; continuity is important for us seniors."
I am new to the tablet world and so far this has been easy to learn to use and read with. Very happy with this product.
"Myself and others have voiced concern of not having enough gigabytes.  8Gb is not enough. After calling Amazon about this they stated that there is no way to add more. They recommended that I send data to cloud,  which I did and it helped a little. Yet, the kindle would still come up with message that I ran out of storage.  I have no pics, no email, a few apps, and no books, etc. At this time I continue to get the message of no storage.  I also purchased a sundisk and I am not able to search or watch movies.<br />I'm going to try and connect to the computer to see if there are any programs running in the background.  I loved my kindle but it looks like divorce may be inevitable.<br />Check out the reviews or problems from other users that experience the same thing."
Fantastic for the price I paid.  Purchased it during the 79$ sale.  I use it mainly for Web browsing and playing Hearthstone.
"Ready to work right out of the box.  Beautiful screen. Nicely built. Good for email, music, Amazon and Facebook.  I'm also looking forward to using it like a Kindle reader. However, I've already spent half a day trying to load card reader apps for Square and Paypal with no success. I'm not sure it will work with either one. That could be a big disappointment."
"I wish I hadn't left my original Kindle in the rain.  I loved it.  Thought I'd like this one, but I really don't.  It's not intuitive like the apple products are.  Oh well, my fault for drowning the Kindle I loved."
"After 7 months i'am sorry too say that this is very disappointing. I can't go through todays deals with out it going back to the beginning. I can scroll down and click on a deal and I have to start all over by clicking view all again it will not go back where I left off. When reading a book and I try to go too the next page and it go's to home to carousel. Now I use fist kindle, it may not be as fast but it doesn't leave you starting all over. The first and second kindle's are the best no problems with those."
"The size and functionality of the Fire HD7 are great, the only downsides I see to it so far are the glare and the battery life.  So far, the glare seems pretty bad it most light settings when you have something dark on the screen.  As for the battery, I know it is a tablet and not an e-reader with e-ink but I think they could have done more regarding the battery life.  My battery only lasts 1-2 days even if it is in standby mode most of the time."
"Purchased for my niece and she loves it.  No problems at all, now have to purchase online books for her to read."
thanks
"Disappointed with all the ads. I have the original Fire, which suits my needs, but I figured this one would be a good upgrade. This one is more like the Google Play. Battery won't hold charge. Now it has died 10/14/16. I can't imagine buying another Amazon product."
"I never thought about owning one, until my Father sent it to me as a gift to help me recover from surgery. It's Great! Thx. Dad"
The Kindle Fire HD 7 provides a vivid display and great ease moving in and out of apps. We have had no issues with our purchase for the last few months and it is easy enough for my mother and my 2 year old child to navigate through it with ease!
"I did love it until 3 months after purchase when Amazon is now telling me there is nothing I can do and no way to get a replacement. I had one of the original kindle keyboards which Amazon replaced no questions asked after mine starting sticking keys after 6 months. That kind of customer service made me a lifelong supporter of Amazon. However, denying warranty claims less than 3 months of use on the fire is making me reevaluate Amazon as a company altogether. My kindle fire started to crash apps left and right recently. These are not foreign apps but the Amazon video and Netflix ones. Multiple times it has crashed while I'm watching a prime video. I have to turn off the device and reboot in order to resume my place, which is also not saved. Now the battery depletes within hours when it's in resting mode. There is something defective with my model but Amazon doesn't care."
Love it!
"the charging port stopped working after 6 months..i love the device but this is a common defect if you read the reviews..well i called amazon and they claim they changed the port and it is now better.They could not direct me to any site where it states this so i must take an amazon staffs word for the change,I would hesitate to buy another w/out the extended service plan. It is a common problem and amazon never mentions it..There are even like over 20 you tube sites that show how to fix it. BUT as i love it when it works i gave it a 5 star ..This is my second fire i am buying in 2 years due to the port being broken except i bought the extended warrenty this time as amazon will do nothing about the port problem"
I've had this tablet for a few months. I like it a lot. This is a brand that I trust. The price just made it even better.
I love it. Thank you
I love my kindle fire hd 7!
"Just picked this bad boy up at best buy due to not willing to wait for shipping. 99.00 WOW great price I paid 219.00 for the first gen fire hd and thought that was a check of a deal. So far the typing is 100% more responsive, the browser just works great compared. Love the new user profiles especially since me and my wife have 2 Amazon accounts. Just a beautiful experience lightweight and love the new size profile easier to hold. My only complaint is I miss the unlock button being in center I'm weird I had my other kindle set up for the button on bottom and since I'm right handed the button on bottom left will not work. All and all not a deal breaker especially for the price. O and sitting here typing I've really noticed the predictive text is freaking BEASTMODE and the autocorrect as well.. bottom line if you read at all with a tablet this is a better choice, if your looking for a gaming powerhouse nvidea has what you want."
"Love it. Have the original Fire, but when this version was offered at a special price I couldn't pass up the upgrade. Much faster. Still getting use to the changes."
"This is a fabulous very user friendly tablet! I got it for a bargain for only $75. I use it primarily for reading,Facebook and shopping. Perfect!"
excellant unit
Still trying to learn it but its seems to ok<br />Having issue loading book which were purchased through Amazon but will figure it out
"This is a great device but I wish I had purchased the 16gb because 8gbs goes very quickly, especially if you consider the operating system is included in that space so in reality you get a about 4gbs of free space. Thankfully you can also store data on the cloud. I bought one in Magenta and its a pretty hot pink color which suits my personality.<br />The HD quality on this is absolutely gorgeous, everything is clear, bright and colorful and watching Netflix on this is great. The kindle store is very similar if not BETTER to google play in my opinion for apps, games and books.  The sound quality is perfect. It isn't too heavy and I can easily read books on my kindle without any trouble. I paid an extra $15 to get an ad free device, personally I think its ridiculous that you have to pay extra money to remove ads from your OWN device and I think amazon needs to rectify that or lower the price dramatically for devices that have the ads.<br />Overall though, I am very happy and haven't put it down since I received it."
Great product. I just wish I had purchased one with more storage space.
"Great tablet!  Got more features than expected.  Will never buy another B&N Nook. Wish I could transfer my 900 Nook books to the Fire HD.  If there is a way to transfer my Nook books to the Fire HD, please let me know."
Love this little tablet!
The camera is good! I like that you can choose the color of your kindle as well. I have the 3rd generation kindle  and I love this new kindle!!
I love that I can access every site I want and see it fully. Just like a laptop.
I can not get the Fire HD 7 to connect with my internet.  Need more information with the product when you get it.  Whatever happened to instruction books?
Was not informed of a 3 month warranty when your defective device is replaced with a new one. Now I'm being offered a refurbished one with 20 dollars off of that. The replaced one is not even 7 months old. I have yet to have one of these last more than 8 months. I would not recommend the kindle or kindle fire hd to anyone.
love my kindle fire. My husband is reading &#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; and I finished one book and am on my second one.<br />The cover that I ordered won't fit but the &#34;Fire&#34; is wonderful.
"While I like the bigger size, it does not fit my other fire case which I love and had ordered it from Amazon. Now the case is much more costly and not in my reach."
This is the first Kindle I have owned.  It was very easy to navigate and start using.  I am very pleased with it!
I would give it negative stars if I could.  I  bought it to play Minion Rush only to find out it's &#34;incompatible&#34; with the Fire HD 7. Waste of money!
I find it hard to navigate.  My Kindle Fire is so much easier to use.
"Got this as an anniversary gift for my wife since she loves to read and she loves it. We have iPads, iPhones and laptops but this tablet fills a void those devices can't. The 7&#34; is perfect for reading and games on the go. The sturdy build means we don't have to baby it and no one builds ereaders like Amazon. The only downside is now I want one. Thanks Amazon for a great product at a great price."
My only complaint is that there is a really bad glare on the screen. If I am trying to watch a movie anywhere but a completely dark room it is impossible to see when the movie goes to an unlit set.
Love it!!
"Device just 'hid' all my (736) personal documents and &#62; 400 books. After 3 years of satisfactory use, the Fire has just hidden all personal documents and books loaded on it.  They are shown in the Directory when it is attached to a laptop, but are not accessible on the device itself.  I had patient help from someone in the US and was then referred to a 'technical expert' overseas who started soliciting information by e-mail from the engineers while I was talking.  This is very poor customer service for a customer who chose Amazon over Apple. Won't make that mistake again."
I thought I wanted a tablet with a larger screen but I am quite pleased with the Fire HD 7.  So glad I didn't spend all that money on an iPad!  This tablet is perfect for me.
I just love the Fire HD 7.  So far it has been easy to use.
picture is extremely clear
"I just wanted a replacement for my original Kindle but this one is way too complicated and I still don't know how to access my books.  Someone who needs Internet, email and tablet or laptop-type capability will love it.  For me, a simple Kindle replacement would have been preferable."
"I bought 2 of these when they were the Daily Deal.  I have nothing bad to say about them, especially for the price.<br />They are pretty snappy and do what we wanted them for.  My wife wanted one to read books, check email and look at her sales ads on Sunday.<br />My son wanted it to read books, watch movies and play a few games, again it works great for those things.<br />I may end up getting one for myself before all is said and done."
"We bought 3 2nd generation 7&#34; Kindle Fires for our boys in February of 2014.  They boys only use Kindle Freetime.  When we first got them, we were so happy with them that I talked everyone I could into buying a Kindle instead of an iPad for their kids.  Late last year, a software update was completed.  Since then, we have had nothing but problems.  We fight with storage issues almost every time the kids pick up their kindles.  I have spent countless hours on the phone with customer service and uninstalled and reinstalled software, done factory resets, and done every force stop they told me to...as well as repeating it on the other kindles when they start doing the same thing.  Even customer service is stumped at this point. If it were only one of the 3 kindles I would assume it was a glitch, but all 3 kindles are having the same issue.  The last factory reset gave us 1 week of usage (less than 5 hours of actual playtime).  The only games played at this point are the games provided by the Kindle FreeTime Unlimited subscription we have.  They are sending a replacement for the one kindle that is the worst at this point (the one most recently reset), so hopefully we will find a solution.  If we hadn't gotten so much enjoyment out of the Kindles when they were functioning correctly, I would have given fewer stars."
the cord should be longer otherwise I am happy with it.
I love my new Kindle Fire and the freetime app and firefly app.
"Really great product. Does almost anything you would want your phone to do except make calls and send texts. Of course with a much bigger screen. If you want a small computer this is not it. The battery life is a disappointment. I would recommend getting the case, screen protector and a stylus to go with it."
Excellent!!!!!
It's hard for me to adjust to this being I have always owned apple products. It has been a challenge to learn how to work  a Fire HD. I'm unsure if I would ever purchase another one. Maybe it would be easy if India not have Apple products.
"This unit met all of my expectations and then some. Excellent product at a reasonable price. And of course, the tech support via Amazon is always there.  I highly recommend this unit."
I love this
love it!
"Problem with sound volume.  For unknown reason/s, the volume does not remain constant as set.  It suddenly fades and no matter how high I adjust it, it remains so weak, it is difficult to hear.  The only recourse I have is to turn the unit off and after about a minute, turn it on again - but this is not the way it should be."
We love it :-)
Great sale price... For my kitchen
"Upon initially playing around with this device, I thought it was pretty great. It wasn't till I purchased one that I found a myriad of issues. I simply cannot recommend this device at all.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Affordable<br />- Nice physical design<br />- Durable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Riddled with ads that you have to pay 15.00 to get removed. They state that the ads are there to subsidize the low cost but why isn't this information given anywhere on the packaging? Had I known the device was subsidized with ads, I wouldn't have even considered it<br />- No custom software:  I have the 4th gen edition of this device and the bootloader has not been exploited so no custom ROMS, no google play, or google apps for the matter<br />- The amazon software is garbage, looks nice but lacks functionality like custom backgrounds<br />- The app store is limited when compared to Google Play or App Store: many apps are simply not available on the platform. As of this writing, there is no way to get Google Play on this device<br />- The app store does not do refunds, all sales are final, unlike Google and Apple which have a time window to return app purchases. I purchased a manga reader app for my daughter and paid to remove the ads, amazon took 5 bucks and I still have ads with no recourse now"
"This is an amazing tablet.  I have an iPad but honestly, my Fire HD is my &#34;go to&#34; device.  I was somewhat apprehensive at first, but after using my Fire for a couple of months, I use my iPad primarily for streaming music.  Everything else I do on my Fire HD.  Great product!"
Love it
Excellent tablet!
just what I ordered and expected the Kindle to be
"I wanted to upgrade my old Kindle for my husband.  When I got the one day offer of $79 for the Kindle Fire,  I thought I would not only get an updated Kindle but a lot of extras.  The Fire is a nice gadget but I'm disappointed in the extra weight and size.  I'm comparing it to the old Kindle and my Nexus 7.  So far, I've not been able to discern any improvement of the Kindle reader itself other than flipping the pages with a finger.  Some of the apps I downloaded had to be opened with Facebook, so I deleted those...I hate Facebook.  I hope we enjoy the Fire as it is used more often."
"I bought the Fire tablet for my 11 year old after his iPad broke. I could not see spending the money Apple wanted so I researched the Fire and found great reviews! I loved the way I could customize it by picking the accessories/features I wanted.<br />The speed in playing/loading is good and matches that of the iPad. My son loves his and always carries it around with him! I did purchase the Poetic protection case to go along with it and was not disappointed in it's protection - one drop resulting in a direct corner hit and it is still going strong!<br />I have seen how much my son loves it, I plan to get one of my own!"
Bought this for my 6 year old. She loves it.
This is our first device like this and so far my daughter loves it. User friendly and great parental control as well. Definitely do not regret the purchase. Great price as well
can not read books that i purchased on device and on desktop
I've had all the kindles.  They are all great in their own way. Especially love the speakers and picture quality of the fire!  Have been an Amazon prime member for a long time and the deals have saved me hundreds. Can't go wrong with any kindle.
"Does not work goes to white screen multiple time a day and have only had for a week. Very disappointed! Had old kindle fire and loved it this one is terrible, so bad the wife wants to try another brand and she loved her old one so much. Not sure what happened but this one is a total miss fire."
Very nice!
Love my Kindle Fire!
"It's an improvement on my Kindle Fire 7&#34;. I like the forward view camera. The USB charger that came with it is excellent. Now you can charge while your using it. I got the added memory but I never ran out with my Fire, so I'll have to find out how valuable that is."
It would be nice if the ads were not there.
"Very durable, exceeded my expectations. Glad i chose this over iPad mini."
I really like it.
"This is My 3rd Kindle which I love as much as my children. Excellent product, compares to any tablet."
"Yes, Kindle Fire HD 7 did meet my expectations.  The only thing I would change at this point is how to make it lighter.  When I added the fold over cover, it was heavier that I would have liked."
"I like it to the extent that it was working fine and now after a week it is not.  It is (was) much better and faster than my first generation Kindle Fire that this unit is replacing.  However, I have to return this particular one because about 1/2 my apps, including Silk, are not working properly.  They either won't load at all or close inexplicably when I am using them.<br />Other than that the speakers are surprisingly good and the screen resolution is very good.  I'll update my review once I have the replacement for my defective unit."
"Got this as a gift for me. I really like it. Great screen images, light weight and didn't break when my three year old dropped it. Plus love the color. Already planning on buying more for my kids."
Great!
Seems a little slower than the 6&#34; fire but otherwise I love it  Update...I DO NOT LOVE IT! It keeps giving dhcp error and won't stay connected. Want to get it replaced/fixed but will not buy another one
This is my second kindle...I love it
Love it!!!  I purchased it for my eight year old and I use it too!  Very easy to use!
"The only complaint is the lack of written, hands on instructions - rather than the guide in the sytem itself.  When I purchased my Kindle ebook, there was a booklet that I referenced frequently until I was well versed - and occasionally still do."
"I got this for my son, and he absolutely loves it.  Says the picture quality is so much better, excited that it has a camera, says the sound quality is so much better then his old tablet."
"love it ,sounds great looks great"
Great
"I purchased the Fire HD for my daughter. She has multiple sclerosis, so she had some issues setting it up. I called customer service, and a Leona assisted her. My daughter loves her Kindle. I am so happy to see her so happy. For some reason I thought a cover came with it, she sometimes drops things. Will order one for her later. I love my Kindle!!!  Darlene Maalo"
Great!
Nice
"when the listing said that the device had a 16GB memory space, i expected that to be the case.  However, when i attempted to move files from one kindle to the other, it told me that it only had a 12 GB storage space.  Not what i was expecting, but the device has performed to the expectations i had for it."
Its great for the whole family
"I really enjoy watching prime movies, shows, music and shows so it meets my expectations.  I wish that there were more apps for it that is the only reason I did  not give it a five. I do not like Netflix on it though. Netflix is essentially the same as prime, so it is not worth the money to me."
Kids Love it!
love the new one. Has more on it then the old/
Very easy to use.  Really liked it.
I'm enjoying this kindle as much as I enjoy my original kindle 2.
I would buy this again . It is so much better than what is said about it .
If I knew it had advertisements I would not have bought it.  Annoying.  Preferred the format of the old Kindle Fire better.
This is the worst device ive ever used. it is useless.
"I have a laptop, and a smartphone and was wanting something to just slip in my purse and take anywhere without breaking the bank. I have the original Kindle and was a fan of that so I decided to take a chance on this and I love it. Perfect for me and I love Amazon Prime. It is a win win in my books. With the cloud storage you have more room for music, videos and tons of other features. Very well built since the first addition too!!!"
"Very good, fast, convenient. no complaints."
"Fire HD 7,7&#34;  I love it great buy."
"Great tablet, I'm older so the touch screen is new to me, but it's performing well. I need practice and to learn it. Great fun. Does what I expected and more."
this is my second Kindle and really enjoyed the first one.  I expect this one to be also.
love it
Love it! So easy to use. I plan on using it as my laptop while traveling.
"If you are looking for product that is larger than your phone, but much more convenient that you laptop to check email, shop or surf online, this Kindle HD Fire is it.  I bought my wife a kindle fire last year and she loved it.  I was able to take this HD version on sale and haven't regretted it."
"The HD 7 is the best Kindle I've ever purchased, and I've had 5. The HD display is very sharp."
The screen and ease of use are great. Just needs to be bigger.
Very nice.  Easy to use and carry
I now have no need of a husband OR a cat....Love it!!!!
"son loves it. Faster than previous model. color is eye catching and exciting. memory holds more than previous one unless your kids snap a lot of pictures. We use freetime for the kids and you can set time limits individually on books, apps, movies, games and educations apps. so when the kids time is up it turns off and they think the battery died. overall great device."
Much thinner and lighter than previous generations. Bright screen. Fast.
This is the best upgrade yet!  I have had all three Fire's - have to say this is my favorite one yet.  I would definitely recommend this purchase.
I love it. The promos are great on books. I love being able to use it for everything vs. Just reading.
Got unit on sale and saved a bunch.  It worked great right out of the box and is a great little gadget for games and web browsing.
Not what we expected.
I love my fire never getting rid of it
"Works wonderfully.  Picture quality is great, though not as good as Ipad"
I love my tablet! It's only been two weeks but it meets my needs. I learn of a new function everyday. The only thing I don't like is local retailers do not carry many needed accessories.
Really liking this tablet. Would recommend to anyone.
I LOVE this device!! Colors are clear; print is easy on the eyes; games explode !!! This was Mother's Day to me!!!
"Nice. Fast ,clear"
Very happy with this purchase.  I'm still learning how to use it so far no issues
I love it
"Small enough to fit in my purse, but larger than a smart phone. Ill be taking it on vacation"
"It was very simple to set up and is very easy to use.  Only two criticisms.  The button to turn on and off the device could be a little bigger.  I have only take a few pictures with the camera, but they have been grainy, so  not sure how good the pictures will be."
"Like it a lot, disappointed that I would have to pay around 20.00 for a screen saver....using a plastic baggie."
Love it. Awesome little device.
"Love it , it does everything, has some kind googling features. Couldn't be happier."
"I like it. I had a Kindle for years,  and wanted just a little bit more.  My Kindle was getting some age on it and i was thinking it may be time to let it be the back up. This unit came on sale and I just couldnt pass it up.<br />If you are wanting a &#34;full function Tablet&#34; this is not it.  It will however, read books (just like the Kindle) , being a color screen mags look better, it does handle PDF (something the Kendle did not do well). I also use it to watch Hulu and works very well for that.<br />Bottom line is, for the money its a good buy. Just remember its not a $400 Tablet."
"Seems to hang up sometimes. Not sure why - I am not on the internet when it does. Takes a little getting used to - didn't come with any instructions. I bought it for my mother and she wouldn't have any idea how to set it up, so I have to help her out and show her how to use it.  Otherwise, so far I think it was a good deal. I gave it 4 stars due to the hanging it does. I have had to shut it off a couple of times to start over."
great tablet and a great price!
"This is the excellent birth day gift from my son I love my Fire HD 7,7&#34; very much. this is the best"
"The Fire HD 7&#34; is awesome. This was my first tablet purchase, although I have played around with other tablets through family and friends. The Fire is best suited for my needs. I am having a great time using this device. So many available options to utilize and connect with. The size, weight, speed, navigation is perfect and the resolution is amazing. I feel right at home with the Fire. Received a fantastic deal on the purchase and it arrived at lightning speed. Thank you Amazon."
"I was disapppointed that you cannot read on the Fire Tablet in any kind of light - especially in the sun, etc. The Kindle Paperwhite was fantastic for reading anywhere!  I thought I was upgrading to the tablet for other uses in addition to reading books, but it is not as good as the paperwhite.  I am not sure why you would not put the paperwhite technology in your tablet.  My paperwhite device didn't work anymore (not sure why...customer service couldn't help either), so I took the Deal of the Day - great price for the Fire Tablet, but as I said, disappointed because there is too much glare!"
I love it!!!
"I want to know how to get rid of parental controls. Every time my Fire is off or just in sleep mode, I have to put in a pin #.  I am 72 years old. I don't need parental control - how do I get rid of it?  Otherwise, I am pleased with the product."
Great tablet. Only complaint is that it doesn't display the battery charge status when it's recharging and shuts down
I love my Fire  HD 7&#34;!!!!!
Most of the movies i like r not free!<br />The same with the music.  What keep of free where advertising?
Great so far
"This is my second Kindle Fire (I bought the first one 2 years ago and was very pleased with it) and I am thrilled. It is easier to use, lighter, and more comfortable to hold with the thicker case. Kindle rocks!"
love my new kindle. Like my access to good reads and also my collections ability.
Love it!  Battery life is good too!
This is my 4th kindle purchase. I love mine so much that I am buying them for all the gkids when bday come around
It arrived on time and exceeded my expectations operationally.  It was easy to set up and get running on wireless.
This small and VERY durable tablet has proven to be very convenient especially when it is combined with the Amazon Prime Cloud services.<br />Excellent Photo Display !!
"This is everything that I could have hoped for! Granted, I've only had it for about a week, but it has every little thing that I wanted it to have!"
"This is my 2d Fire.  I love my first one, and this one is even better!"
"way faster than my kindle fire first addition,i hope it stays that way my first one was fast until they came out with the 2nd addition and then the third now it wont hardly down load a u tube video,i think they stop supporting them so you will do just what i did,buy a newer one,that is ok because if this  one does what the last one did i am done with kindle,and will look else where for my next tablet,,,"
"I am not super tec savy. The graphics and sound are good. But I am an iPhone user and have a IMac.... So the flow of how it works is not natural to me. I do not like that the calendar isn't linked with my phone/ computer. However, I would have never paid the price of a iPad.<br />My kindle fire is still far better for just reading!"
Works great
"Battery life is solid so far.  Wifi isn't as strong as my MacBook Pro, but adequate.  Easy for my young son to use with FreePlay."
Works great and great price.
I love it!! It's a completely new way to read books! Easy interface and very useful
"The Fire HD 7 has exceeded my expectations.  It was easy to set up my e-mail and books from my old Kindle.  I was worried the screen would not be easy to read, but I dimmed it slightly, and have found it very comfortable.  I really like the versatility and easy access to all the Prime membership options, and seem to be taking more advantage of what Prime has to offer.  The battery needs to be recharged more often than my old Kindle, but not as often as my current iphone."
I never use a tablet but I really like this tablet..so easy to use and I can do almost the same thing on it i as I did on my laptop
"I'm still learning how to use it but what I have seen and learned so far I'm in seventh heaven. I've got games for my grandkids, I'm downloading books for them also for when they spend the night. I put a protective screen cover on it and it went on without air bubbles. It has long battery life. I love the protective cover that can be used as a stand. The little ones love to use it that way."
Easily freezes up.
Love it
Meh.
Kindle is amazing. This is my first fire but I have had multiple kindle readers. Customer service is amazing and the product is beyond expectations.
Great job
"Love it! I am glad that I purchased the 7&#34; screen, as opposed to the 6&#34; screen because of the dual speakers. In addition, I am glad that I purchased 16 GB, as opposed to 8 GB because this leaves more room for apps and other digital storage. I would recommend that you purchase the upgrade to 16 GB for storage. I think it is worth it. Of course, the 16 GB upgrade is not necessary, but personally, I believe the additional GB's makes things easier in the long run.<br /><br />I think this is a very nice tablet for the price. The picture is clear with good color for watching movies. In addition, it has good clear sound that is very easy to hear with the dual speakers. The sound comes through very loud and clear, so I had to turn it down about half-way on the volume setting. The dual speakers are very useful for outdoors. An A/C outlet plug is included in the package with the unit. The size of the Fire HD 7 is just right for me to carry in my handbag or in a case. It is a great size to take with you to a coffee shop, class, work, outdoors, or just to use at home.<br /><br />Amazon made everything very easy to use on the Fire HD7. I am very happy with the features and performance of this unit for the price. I highly recommend it!"
Love that it charges so quickly
Broke almost immediately.
I love this device!  I also have a Fire TV Stick and Fire TV box and they all serve me well!
I love it! This is one of the handsets little thingamabobs that I have yet to come across.
"The Device itself is solid, a great buy. I don't even notice the &#34;special offers&#34;. I would rate the amazon app store 1 star. Be prepared to have to side load any decent app you want, because it's guaranteed not to be on the Amazon app store."
"This is my second Kindle, but my first Fire.  I love to watch movies and shows.  Browse the internet.  Read books,  magazines and papers.  The Prime membership is a must have."
I only wish it had an SD card slot and I'd be very happy. Other than that I love my Kindle Fire!
Vast improvement over my old one. Love it
Love my upgrade!
It's okay
"I am enjoying my fire!!  I'm going take the Fire 7 HD with me on the trip to Alabama, will use with earphones to cover the &#34;are we there yet&#34; from the grandchildren."
Feels sturdier than my old kindle fire. Hopefully this one won't break
"Great product.  Quality craftsmanship.  Replaced my laptop with this fire, couldn't be more happy."
"Very nice. I still am working through the How to dt, but so far 2 thumbs up."
Love it!
"Good product, I just wish that certain apps were available (instagram, youtube, etc.). You also can't change the lock screen on this tablet."
I am having a blast with my BDay gift from my mom.
It's a nice tablet but I shouldn't be forced to see advertisements on something I bought. I dislike how you cannot customize the background and its ads. Please fix this and this tablet would be able to compete with any other brand.
"I love my new Kindle, it's my 1st. I currently have an iPad but the Kindle is faster with great HD quality. I love Prime the music is cheaper than iTunes. I use my Kindle Fire to read & listen to audio book. Best thing the Kindle didn't break my wallet compared"
"It would have been good but I needed to order with more GB.  the 8 GB was not enough storage for me.  I had already accumulated the storage, so when I tried to stream movies through amazon prime membership I was not able to."
Well haven't explore the whole tablet yet but so far so good.
I love it
"I went from a Paperwhite to the FIre and had great expectations.  It had to grow on me which is the only reason I only give it 4 stars.  It is heavier than my old one and not as user friendly.  I do like it, it's just that I didn't fall in love with it like I did the Paperwhite."
I love it.  I use it almost every day.
"Excellent purchase, very easy to use, great buy!"
"Really nice tablet, my kids love it.<br />Easy to use, im glad i bought this item now i just have to figure out how to get rid of the special offers. I really don't care for this offers but im sure other people do."
Beyond my expectations!
Absoletely love it and awesome price!!
Too limiting/ returned
Great
Former Nook color user.  Like the Fire much better
Love it
very nice little tablet and the price was incredible when I ordered ours
"Amazing!! I purchased this as a gift for my dad to replace his HP tablet, what a difference! This tablet is incredible!! The screen clarity is like no other. Needless to say my father loves it!!"
"A nice device, especially for the price. It's quick, has good sound quality, and a nice display.<br /><br />The minimal storage is problematic though. 16 GB doesn't really work well, particularly if your into reading comics and graphic novels.<br /><br />Another issue with the memory that I find highly annoying is the fact that wi-fi is disabled when you reach anywhere near your maximum storage space. I'm actually a little surprised that a portion of the onboard storage wasn't dedicated to alleviate this issue. I run close to maxing out my storage in all my electronics and have never run into this problem before."
Daughter is very happy
like it this tablet has everthing on it
Love it
visually very pleasing.  crisp picture.  i find the charging port annoying.  Have to fiddle with it to get it to connect.  excellent keyboard and easy to operate.
Very nice upgrade from my original Kindle.
Bad.  Doesn't have bookmarks.  Keeps returning to prev page when I rotate devi e.  Want to return<br />..not as good as the one I got 3 years ago.
Great value for the price!
The video display is clear and jumps off the screen.  Navigation is easy.
"Love it, Becky"
"Works great, my Fire is having issues so I upgraded.<br /> Definitely better.<br />Still learning how to use the new features and will add to this post if I run into any issues."
I'm very pleased with this tablet.  Prefer using this over the I-Pad.
"This item is fine I have not got quit use to it. There seems to be no instructions. Maybe in help but I'm not good at working this item. I will learn this new  toy, sooner or later."
"Big fan of the kindle. Had to purchase a new one when the old one died after daily use for two years.  I wish I bought three of them, one for everyone in the family."
very happy with it
It's Amazing I love it!!!!! Me and my fianc&eacute; watch Netflix on it everything looks amazing!!!!
Very very please with my Fire tablet!  Well worth the money !!!
Great. Love it.
This item is wonderful
"I like it, but........I have been using my iPad mini for a very long time, it has the Kindle app on it and that's the way I've been reading my kindle books. There is no difference between the Kindle app for android and Kindle app on Kindle other than I cannot purchase kindle books directly through the Kindle app for android---I must go through Amazon and purchase to download.  No problem.<br />I recently decided I wanted a real Kindle, as I saw a great value for it on QVC--7&#34; Fire HD.  I love the HD display, very wonderful to look it, however there are a couple of downsides as well.......<br />One:  My iPad mini had a better battery life.  I can read my kindle books daily on iPad, leave it unplugged for DAYS, almost a week before I have to recharge.  The Kindle HD does not have as long a battery life--it has a good battery life but not as good as iPad.<br />Two:  The app store for android is unquestionably better!  I play Candy Crush Soda Saga, on my iPad, NOT AVAILABLE ON THE KINDLE!  It's a very popular basic game and I can't believe that Kindle doesn't offer it.  There are a few other apps I use that aren't on Kindle, but I can forget about all of those if they'd just put Candy Crush Soda Saga on----I'd be happy!<br />So basically Kindle is good, but I can do everything and more on my iPad----If Kindle would expand it's range of apps, it would be perfect!!"
"The power button doesn't put the machine to sleep or turn it off. The volume buttons also sometimes jam (without appearing to be jammed) and will move the volume slider all the way down. When using the touchscreen to move back the volume slider, the jam is still persistent on moving the slider until the tablet is muted. Sometimes when powering on it boots into safe mode. Not a fan of the tablet. An Ipad would never have problems with its buttons on adjusting volume and power.<br /><br />On the plus side the device is pretty sturdy."
Does everything well and fast.
I love it!!!!
does all that I need
"I am so happy with the Fire HD 7. It is beyond anything I thought of it. It is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone. I am just starting to explore all of the wonderful options that it has. I had to order a new router, but I am so very happy with this purchase. Maybe someday I will order the keyboard for it. Thank you Amazon!!!!"
Like reading at night and turn light off but I am still figuring how to enlarge the reading material.
great price and first tablet . Works better than I expected
I love it!!!!!
Nice design and improvement over my old Kindle. The lock screen advertisement is a little painful but at least now I have a list of products and manufactures I will certainly not buy from as they now annoy me. Not sure that was the desired outcome but hey if you force me to look at an add then I will most likely avoid your product.
I am very happy with this device. I use it more than my laptop.
"What a great device for a great price! It has so many reasons to recommend it and only one negative, which is the small amount of storage space, either 8GB or 16GB. Everyone should get one of these!"
Loving it.
Great tablet at a great price!  Have really enjoyed using it and it has been easy to set up and load apps on it.
This is my fourth Kindle-I'm an addict!
This was a replacement for a previous  Kindle Fire.I hope it lasts longer than my old one! I'm finding little difference between the two.  It works faster and seems to hold a charge longer.
Did not meet my expectations. Volume constantly fluctuates between high and super LOW. The apps that I wanted to use on it are not available nor compatible.  Very slow to load/process. Very little storage capacity.
"This is my third Kindle. I paid $79 on sale for this one and consider it a great value. It has both front and back cameras, nice to have feature. Also sweet is that you may have your choice of colors, I ordered white. The cloud storage is wonderful as well. I can check email, surf the web, play games, listen to my music and of course read books and news.<br />I really don't need the MayDay function as I didn't have it on my 2012 Kindle Fire HD. As far as I'm concerned, Kindle Fire HD 7 is the best value in a tablet on the market. I love it. I have my fifth Kindle &#34;in color purple&#34; on the way, couldn't resist getting two for that sale price. Oh, yes, I have owned an iPad but prefer the Kindle."
The only problem was it said I didn't have enough storage to take photos.. It's 16gb! Why cant I take photos??
So far I'm loving my kindle fire hd!!!! The best thing I have invested in no more waiting on my books to come in the mail or waiting on the library to get the book in stock.
i hate the ads they are pissing me off
"This tablet is a great  tool to check e-mail, play games, watch movies, read books, newspapers, etc. I use it more than my laptop. My only complaint is that the battery charge doesn't seem to last as long as advertised."
Much prefer this to the Samsung galaxy Tab S
Met all expectations.
Upgraded from an older version to this one.  So far it is great.  Does things I couldn't do on my older one.  Great sound and pictures.
"Love it! Have the original kindle fire and just wanted to update. Great tablet for a great price! Does everything I need it for! Has front and rear camera, which is really nice just haven't used that feature a whole lot yet"
"Bought the Fire HD 7, 7&#34; HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB for my wife she loves it. It is fast and easy to read on."
Great
"Great price, couldn't afford to pass it up.  Its just what I expected but did not notice too much difference between this Fire and my gen 3 Fire except this one has a camera."
"It is easy to use, very clear and concise.  I love the clear colors and the sharp wording, so easy to read.  I am going to buy the one for my grandson."
Its awesone! The picures and sound is crystal.
"Really pleased with the HD 7.  I have been a Kindle Fire user and when they had the special offer on this, I decided it was time for a new one.  So glad I did.  This one is even easier to use than my last.  I love it!"
LOVE My TABLET.....Yaaaa
This was a gift from my son.  I love it....wish it came with an owners guide.
Awesome!
For a first time user of amazon my expirence was excellent .  The fire HD is for my daughter it is very user friendly and the parental controls are easily set. It is a great learning tool.
The price was certainly right and the Fire HD does all that is claimed. Already have a Fire so I guess I was expecting more. Probably will keep the HD and gift the older Fire. Set up is relatively easy and should bring many hours of enjoyment.
So far so good. Need more time to fully evaluate.
"It looks nice, and has a nice display, but since it is a different operating system than both Apple and Android, there are many limitations to what can be installed on it.  I bought it so that we could use all three of our favorite video services - Amazon Prime, Netflix and Vudu, but Vudo (Ultra Violet movies) are not supported on the Fire HD.  I'm afraid if I had known that, it would have been a deal breaker.  The other drawback is that unlike most android devices, there is no place to add more memory.  My daughter has a cheap android tablet that was less than half what the Fire cost, but I was able to add a 32 gb mini SD so that I could put a lot of content on it. It really works well except for the fact that it couldn't get Amazon Prime movies, and it has an inferior camera.  That's why I bought the Fire, but even though the Fire gives me Amazon Prime and a better camera, it doesn't give me other things that were important to me.  So, if I want to have it all, I have to either have two different tablets, or I have to buy an ipad.The other thing that really bugs me is that every time you turn it on, it comes up with a new ad on the home screen.  You can turn it off for an additional $15, but it is VERY annoying, and something that wasn't clear when I bought it.<br />  Again, the display, camera, and ease of use is great.  I also like the ability to set users for children that have restrictions and make it so they can't accidentally buy something, but I would only recommend it to everyone if it didn't have so many limitations and annoyances."
"We are essentially using this in the den as a glorified digital clock.  It sits in a stand most of the time with a digital clock app displaying the time over the entire screen.  This solution works better than any clock I could find since you can see the clock an the dart or with the lights turned up to max brightness.  I really had a problem finding a clock that was actually readable from across the room in both full light and dark conditions.<br /><br />It is also nice to have access to a small tablet in the den.  The Web browser works quite well and the interface is less annoying than I would have expected considering I am a pure Android fan.  The tablet plays streamed videos perfectly and the screen looks great, although the sound from the speakers is pretty poor compared to my Nexus7.  At full price it would not be worth it but for $80 it is a pretty good deal.<br /><br />I paid $80 for it on sale and at that price it is 5 stars but at normal price I can only give it 4."
More than I expected. Still learning how to use it since I am an almost Senior Citizen.  I love the &#34;pink&#34; case.
Love this device. I take it everywhere with me.
Awesome product
can't best it for the price I got it for. Very good deal!
I love having a Kindle to take with me anytime I have waiting time.
"Loving my new tablet!  I had an off-brand and was regretting &#34;saving&#34; money that way; had already decided to get a good quality one.  Then I found this one on a daily deal and could not believe the price.  The color is clear and crisp, it responds quickly and doesn't bog down when transferring from one activity to another, and it is super-fast.  My only regret is that I can't pull up my Nook app on my Kindle tablet; I guess that would be asking too much!"
love it!  I am buying another to give as a gift!
Really nice!!!  I love all the features and the ease of it!
"Love this tablet! Easy to use, and still great for reading"
Love it
Still learning...
I'm still trying to get some things to work.
Love it!
"This was an upgrade for me. I'm very pleased with it. When I had an issue,customer service replied quickly and the issue was resolved."
Excellent!!!!!!!!
Love it. Only one little thing I have found objectionable: the on and off button doesn't work as easy as the older model kindle fire 7.
Great!
Love it and I would give it 5 stars only if I can access my Google play books. Just seem to not be able to do this.
Absolutely Love it!
so easy for an old lady to learn to use.
"This one of 4, wife one me three. I DON'T like to read but the auto books are good"
"This product far exceeded any expectations I had for it.  It takes some practice to get around for all the features, but once you master that, it is an excellent product and value."
"This is my 3rd Kindle. They just keep getting better. Great graphics, easy to use, and kid friendly."
Very fine tablet!
I bought the fire 7 specifically because it has a camera.  But it has no flash so is impossible to use for taking pictures inside and at night.
Have had Galaxy in the past...forever...but I'm getting used to it.
Love it ... Great gift !
My computer is old and crappy and my new kindle doesn't get along with it.
Kindle Fire HD is great. It works much like my old Kindle so that is a plus.  I use it all the time.
Picture and sound quality is great. Some APPs are free. Installed a german language APP for free. Would recommend getting the 16GB versus the 8GB model. There are  sales on Fire HD. So look for a markdown on Amazon or Office Max/Office Depot.
Still learning the machine. Wish it came with a manual.
not bad
Awesome. Fast does the job well.
Love it!  Replacing my Nook tablet which was very disappointing.
"While my first generation Fire, that I bought refurbished, is still working, I could not pass up the special pricing if for no other reason than to take advantage of Family Library and share books and more with my wife who also purchased the Fire HD 7.  Once I got used to the minor differences to my older Fire, the improved display, cameras, and other features made this a great decision."
It's a ok tablet doesn't really blow my mind.
Nice
Fast good tablet but could use bigger screen and a little more customizable features.
I have had my Amazon fire for  about two weeks .  I am very pleased with its performance.  It is easier for me use this tablet.  I would recommend this to everyone.
This was a gift to replace my tablet that died. I would prefer another tablet but this will suffice.
"Love it. Haven't bought a kindle since 2010.  Nice upgrade.  A little heavy, but picked up a few of these on a one day flash sale. Super happy with it. Great way to leverage Amazon Prime on the go."
I like the wider area around the edges. It is lighter and faster than the previous Kindle and I like the updates and operation. Finally moved the power button! The slick finish and tapered sides on the case are hard to grip without a protector.(weight and ease of handling is a factor. Really liked the case on the older unit.) Overall worth the money and I use it constantly.
Its good for the price I paid. Maybe to small for what I am use to. bigger is better
"Item as expected, fast shipping! Thank you!"
The Fire more than meets my expectations
Great tablet own Apple iPad and iPhones very happy with the Fire hd7 . Like it so much will purchase another asap for my granddaughter.The tablet is in a class by itself. Lots of bang for your hard earned buck.
I received my Fire HD 7 3 days ago so I am still getting acquainted with it. I can see already that I am going to like it. This is my second Kindle and I am loving the new features.
"Computers now come in all sizes. Larger than my Samsung Note 4 &#34;phablet&#34; and smaller than an iPad Mini, this device has a fairly large screen that I can still hold in one hand. It was very easy to set up and has worked quite smoothly so far.  I'm looking forward to further exploring its uses, particularly as a Kindle e-book reader and to synch with various cloud-based content from Amazon (one of the major reasons why the device appealed to me). I expect this to be my screen of choice to accompany a mug of coffee at Starbucks and/or other cafes. I also plan to take it on road trips and leave my more bulky notebook at home. I was thrilled to purchase the Fire HD 7 at a special low price, which allowed me to get the 16GB version for under $100. All in all, an excellent deal. Good job Amazon!"
my first tablet... works well... I will be looking for more fire products
"All I can say is great,best money I ever spended"
I absolutely love it.  It is heavier than I wanted.  I purchased a Fire for my son last February and his is much lighter than this new one.  Not sending it back I like it too much!
I Love it!!! 😊
"I wasn't able to download&#34;clash of clans&#34; app game.  Overall,  crisp clear picture and fast."
Sometimes it takes a minute to surf
Great color.  It's everything I expect from a kindle.  Just wish the battery lasted longer
Great tablet
"Very impressed with my new Kindle. I love its versatility, portability and image quality."
It's great
Awesome
Awesome
As advertised
i like it
"I couldn't be more pleased with my kindle fire, love it !!!!!!!!! Has some features that my last one didn't have, like a camera, really love that. Totally happy with my kindle fire."
"Full disclaimer, got it for $60 off regular price. I absolutely love the kindle fire HD 7. The kindle does everything I want a tablet to do at a fraction of the price of an ipad. The app section is great and the device runs smoothly. I haven't dropped it to make sure that it's as durable as the commercials say but hopefully I never have to test that."
"I like everything about my new Fire except that I can't read it outdoors in sunlight.  I have a Paperwhite Kindle and I was hoping to upgrade to the Fire.  Overall, I like it.  Just the one issue that I don't like.  Trying to decide whether to keep it or not."
"I love my Fire that I have had for a few years, but there was some improvement needed in the speakers, especially when watching movies. I couldn't pass up the sale on the HD 7 in., though. The 1st thing I checked after receiving it was to check the speakers. What an improvement. The screen is larger and sharper, the sound is terrific and it loads faster. Thanks for making a quality product at an affordable price."
This is my second Kindle and I love it.  The price was great and the camera and new apps make it fun to use.  I use my kindle everyday.
Arrived ahead of schedule! Already had my prime information entered upon arrival! 10/10 would purchase again.
Have owned several Kindle's that I have passed down to my boys.  The best e reader out there.
I really would like it if I got all the parts of the order.  I did not get the Fire HD7 power adapter. I got the US cable but no adapter. Please let me know what to do .
"Looking for a tablet that this old guy could use even with having a stroke and I think I found it. Had a problem with messages from facebook, but son-in-law helped me with that. Only other thing was no manual."
Overall very pleased<br />Photos slow to upload.<br />Screen quality and definition are sweet
work great!!!
outstanding tablet for the price.  Preforms well
"I originally bought the Kindle Fire to watch when I workout on the treadmill. Have since used it for so much more. The screen is crystal clear, the sound is great, and it is very easy to use. I can pretty much get the same apps I normally use on my iPhone. Great buy!<br /><br />PROS:<br />Intuitive functionality/navigation, screen quality, sound, light weight, lots of accessories.<br /><br />CONS:<br />8G is not enough for watching HD TV shows and movies off line<br />Battery life could be longer"
Kids love it!
It is perfect. My husband loves it.
I love my Kindle. It does what I need & doesn't have the big price tag.
"It seems like the battery runs down quickly when using the internet. I don't even use it to watch movies, I just use it for the internet."
My kids love them! Great deal for the price
"Ridiculously flimsy. Feels cheap, works slow. Honestly I use it to watch Netflix and wwe network as well as read. Issue of that, it turns on when it feels like it, the camera is a joke and suddenly report's that's it out of memory with only five apps and 3 books on it. Returning this one and I've only had it for 5 months & it had given several problems. Last fire I'll buy for many years."
Wonderful little device.
"Had a Kindle Fire about 2 years ago, Gave it to my daughter because I got a 10&#34; tab, Missed my Kindle Fire so I got myself the Fire HD, Love it but still miss the original Kindle Fire, But this one is wonderful. Love Love  Love the Fire HD , Also with my first Kindle had a problem it became frozen so I called the help line late one night and they walked me through it and fixed the problem, Very impressed."
"It's like being a child in a candy store. There's so much to try, so much to view. The only drawback for me is, there's not enough space for me to do everything I want to do with it. Books, movies, tv shows, music. I run out of space quite often and have to do things in shifts. But other than that, I am deliciously fond of my new buddy."
"My 3rd fire, except for my first with charging port issues I can't recommend a better small tablet."
"I would have given it 5 stars but, it doesn't have my two favorite games. High 5 Casino and Caesars Casino. On my first generation I had both!! This is my third Kindle but I miss my first one."
I am glad that I purchased this item.  It does the things that I want it to.
"not what I thought it was, have to buy to much extra stuff just to use it!!  Think I will send it back&#62;"
Easy to set up and operate - love it !
It's a good product.  Unfortunately I dont have wifi at home so I can't use as often as I would like.
"We would not use it to access the internet, take pictures or video's.  We just need something simpler that we could just read books on.  We loved our first kindle since the day we bought it in 2009 .  We would probably be interested in the new Kindle Paper White as it seems to be somewhat close to the original kindle that we enjoyed so much.  I hope you understand that we are in our seventies and do not feel the need to have all of the electronic equipment that the younger generation couldn't live without."
"I love how easy it is to use, love that it came preset to my Amazon account. Love how easy it is to access all of my Amazon Prime benefits, but....I don't like that I can't access the Google Play store. There are lot of apps that I like or need to use that is not available on the Amazon app store. So either make all apps available or allow users to also link their Google account to the Kindle. Giving us more flexibility is only going to make your product better. I could of bought an Android tablet and it would of allowed me to use the Amazon app store. This is the only thing that I dislike about my new Kindle. Wish I had known before purchasing it."
Battery life not so good
"I believe it to be a very nice tablet for the money...there was a one day sale that made it super-affordable ($59 after discounts).  I have zero complaints about the product at this time.  It does what it is supposed to do, and does it rather quickly."
"Awesome product, great for kids in school"
Works great.
Great bargain with the free shipping. My fourth Kindle.
I love my fire!!! I use it predominantly to watch Amazon prime shows and movies. There are many more features available on the tablet that I haven't even used yet (like the camera). I have really enjoyed this purchase and strongly recommend it.
"Like always, I didn't know what it was I was buying. Old ladies, eh? This one will go back and I want the biggest, bad-ass HDX I can buy. If you are over 60 and you think this is going to do what your Chromebook does? That Facebook and Yahoo news will be configured the same? Not so. The screen on the Kindle is configured to Kindle and it's different. If you don't like change and expect this to be like your computer you will be disappointed. From what I understand, I can work my Smart TV with the HDX so, back this goes, on to a bigger memory', a nicer screen."
"Love it💕 Came earlier than I expected. Great price. Perfect size. Wonderful quality. I would definitely recommend. After I purchased mine I bought 2 more as gifts. They also came before I expected 😊. Came in a nice box,  with charger."
"Amazon has been a great company with good customer service until I called them regarding my son's kindle fire hd 7&#34;.  It was dropped from the top of the bath tub to the floor (about 12&#34;) and the screen shattered, not just a crack.  I saw Amazon's commercial the next day that shows the kindle being thrown down by a machine, then dropped from the top of a moving car where it bounces and it's picked up and it's perfect.  Apparently, this is false advertising as these (mine) are NOT as durable as advertised.  I know electronics should not be dropped, but accidents do happen occasionally.<br /><br />Amazon customer service offered a whole $20 discount for a refurbished device.  When the glass on mine obviously had some kind of defect causing the glass to shatter.<br /><br />Buyer beware!! Very disappointed!  I'm an Amazon Prime member and I will be rethinking how much I spend with Amazon from this point forward."
"I have been using an antique kindle for six years, so this is an amazing piece of technology to me. I absolutely love the back lighting, no need for a reading light! Also it is in color!"
Love it!
"I love it, just wondering what took me so long to try it out, now I am hooked"
"My new Kindle Fire HD 7, HD Display, w/ wi-fi 16GB is indeed pretty neat! I haven't completely sorted out what all it does over my old black & white unit but I'm working on that! So I'm just giving it a four star rating for now.. Shipping was fast. Amazon kicked up my deliver date by about 2 weeks!"
"I love my new Kindle Fire HD 7. I can listen to music apps, play games, check email, and (of course!) read my favorite books. It's easy to set up, easy to use, and allows me to change the brightness to a level I'm comfortable with - whether inside, outside, or in the dark."
Got it for my wife and she loves it. She had the first fire years ago and this is faster and better all around.
Worth it
I love it. I feel like I have to charge it a lot  but that might be because I use it so much. I forget to turn it off when I'm not using it.<br />It's a great tablet. Highly recommended.
"Takes too long to download. Freezes up at least 2x per day and has to be charged everyday. If I had more time, I would send it back. Not worth the price."
I have been very pleased with my fire exceeds my expectations
Great tablet for the price.  Bought to replace a broken iPad my children were using.  My son is able to use all the apps from school on this tablet for a fraction of the iPad price.
"I am SO HAPPY WITH MY FIRE HD 7 ! I got it for a birthday present, though I did read many of the reviews before requesting it..and I ma sure glad that I did.Though beautiful, sleek, with rapid fire browsing,..best of all is the kindle reader. I have a paper white which I love.. but I find this far less taxing on my eyes. The only issue  I have while reading in bed is that it gets heavy holding it. I love that I can hold my paper white one handed and turn the page at the same time. Not so this beauty..but it is worth the trade off for the clarity and brilliance... just love this!"
Very user friendly.
I love my new Kindle Fire!
Would be 100% better with google play or if it was rootable.
"much more lightweight and durable than the earlier models! I love it, my 6 year old daughter loves it, they must have for portable Entertainment!"
I bought this for my grandson who is 8 yrs. old he loved it but I wish there had been some kind of instructions.
Even better than I expected.  I don't have a PC and this is just as good!
An hdmi output would make this item 5 stars in every way
It's an amazing tablet and the price is amazing also.
Hands down one of my best Lil gadgets so far! Simple easy to use and always handy. No need to be bored anymore because there's always something to do on my fire!
Love this but I just wish it came with more instructions.  Since I am 70 yo I am having a time searching for books etc.
"Absolutely fantastic.  I bought it for a great price, and am very happy with it so far."
Wonderful! Great service and product just as described! A+++
No access to normal android store. I dislike that in particular. Other than that it's great.
So fire so good. Resolution is great. I'd like to see a video help guide.
I absolutely love it! Light easy to use and color is perfect. Good sound too.
"I like the larger storage space, the color, and the price I purchased it for. The battery doesn't last as long as did my  kindle fire hd. But over all the clarity & the speed of the web is awesome."
"This item has so many features, many of which I will never use.  A great value for the money though."
"this  is my second fire.  they are great tablets for our use.  But,  two weeks after i got it - it was a deal of the day on amazon, could of saved $40!  so check the sales first."
Easy to use.  Simplistic operating system with a fairly good battery life.  Excellent video and sound.
Love it! Only down fall is the glare.
It's OK but I thought I could do word documents and others without paying fro every application to do so.
Love it!!!!
My wife loves it
Love my new Fire HD
it is great
This is the fourth Kindle we've purchased and overall it's ben a pretty decent product for apps and books to read. I'd like to use it occassionally for streaming and every one has some new gizmo that Amazon sells you. I just ordered an HDMI adapter for this 4th generation Kindle Fire and we'll see what happens. Last Kindle we had to get a dongle device for miracasting. If Amazon hopes to sell me any more of their products then they need to put the micro HDMI jack back on their Kindles like the HDX we bought two devices ago. Good value for the money but I'd rather pay a tad more and have what I need. Okay I've used it for a week and also got the HDMI adaptor for this unit and it connects to tv fine and allows streaming from Kindle to tv. It's a little slower connecting to web pages on the internet verus our last two Kindles and you actually only get about 5GB of useable storage so people may want to consider the 16GB Kindle. Overall I bumped it up from a three to a four but wouldn't give it a five because of lacking HDMI micro jack and slow browser.  OKAY UPDATE! I've now used this Kindle for over four months and this is the worst one out there. I constantly have to turn the unit off because it locks up and it's too slow connecting compared to my spouses and the one I gave up to my grandson. I would only get a 16GB unit at minimum. Sorry but have to downgrade this device as unsatisfactory.
"I purchased this kindle fire as a replacement for the original kindle I purchased four years ago.  I was happy when I received this new one. The new kindle is simpler to use, faster, with a great HD screen.  Amazon was very helpful and pre-registered the kindle so when I received it, reinstalling the apps was a breeze"
I am very happy with my Fire HD 7.
Bought a maintianace program and it wouldn't let me register the Fire HS.  Plus QVC send two so I sent one back
"I love this thing. Great price, great device."
ok.nothing to brag about.
Great for me and my 3yr old!
Easy to use. Good clarity. Much better than original.
Loved it !
"I've had a Kindle Paperwhite for many years and am very happy with it.<br />The Kindle HD7  is amazing, it's so lite,the pixels produce a very vivid picture and the processor is very fast.  I couldn't be happier, thank you Amazon."
This is an awesome peace of tech. Especially if you get it on sale
"I like the size a lot. My computer crashed and I thought I was going to have to buy a new one, but my best friend got a Fire HDX 7 and I liked here's so I thought I would get one too, but I didn't need the &#34;X&#34; version because I don't download music our movies like my friend, so I settled for the regular HD 7 version.<br /><br />I like it a lot! It's much more compact than a computer, less expense,I can very easily take it anywhere!<br /><br />I highly recommend it to everyone. And I'm a very skeptical person too."
"The protruding horizontal-bar start button on this model is awkward; must be held down for a while to turn pad on or off, unlike regular Fire HD 7, which had a recessed round button that only needed a brief press to sleep, wake, or power on/off. Otherwise, meets expectations."
This was a good deal with the special offer price of about $80.
"Perfect for me, easy to maneuver around.Good size and screen resolution is very nice.  Can't beat the price, either!"
"Bought it to update from 2012 Fire HD (spurred by the special one day offer). Some remarkable differences in the upgrade, especially the quality of the display, the new ease in operating, and the two cameras. I am quite happy with the upgrade and find I am using it more than I did the 2012 HD, (which, by the way, I gave to my wife, who is now happily using it to get and read books, and is learning how to use it for its other aspects.) However, I do wish there was greater ability to now acquire some of the apps available through the Google Store."
Awesome I got as a birthday present from my daughter it's awesome aloha Yvonne owens
"This is a great tablet.  It's lightweight, easy to hold, and has many of the features i was hoping for."
Can't do much with it it's more made for kids then adults
Gets hot but work and I'm not paying for a used one
Awesome and then some!!!!!!!!!
"Great tablet, I just hate how the battery gets drained even when I'm not using it though. Maybe I'm doing something wrong! Great for college students that need something to hold their books and also some leisure apps. Great tablet though!"
Very great kindle fire!! Love it!!
"Paid to download a movie and well...  It doesn't FIT on the Fire.  Really?  If you are supposed to be able to download movies, don't you think AT LEAST ONE should fit?  Nothing like watching 97% of a movie, and not know how it ends.  Over it!  I don't return things, but this is going BACK!!!"
Adding a manual would have  got a fifth star.
A sure deal not to be beat! I got this on sale for $79! Wonderful price for a first class tablet. Color is great and sound is crystal clear. Not done familiarizing myself with it but so far it is great. Sure not a better deal to be had! My last kindle suddenly died for no apparent reason. So as long as this one does not do the same I will be thrilled.
Just love my new Fire HD 7.  It's so easy to use.
I love my kindle fire. This is the first one i have ever owned and for a first time user I find it very easy to use. The only problem I 'm having is with Skype.
Great tablet!!!
GOOD PRODUCT
Ok...
I'm  really glad I purchased this note book.  I'm still in the learning process but I'm having fun.
Love it!!!!  Met all my expectation and then some.  Beautiful screen and sound.  Fast internet
"I'm 61, but these kindles have a beautiful picture!! It's going to take me awhile to learn how to maneuver around in the programs."
"Tablet works as expected. Price was good. Use it for email and web browsing. Camera not that good.  6 Gig memory - would be nice if they had A SD card!  Or at least they let you pick A 16 G or 32G model!  Holds one movie..,  Amazon offers 16G  version for $119 on May 25.  For the money, good product. Would pay a liitle more for SD card version, at least 16G memory desired"
Exceeded my expectations for performance and general ease of use.
"I was disappointed a little.Expected<br /><br />Disappointed a little,"
Thanks . Nice product.
Just what I expected it to be. No disappointments here. Actually though it is faster than I expected and I would not hesitate to purchase another Fire.
"I just received my new kindle hd 7. So far the only thing I do not like is the carasol feature. On this kindle the carasol only holds/shows 30 books or apps. Everytime you open a new book or app the item at the end of the carasol drops off. I don't like this because if my nieces or nephews are using it they are going in and out of many of the app games which, in turn, ends up dropping my books off the carasol. I then have to go and look for my books because they are no longer conveniently located on the carasol. And when you're reading several books at one time that's a real pain. My other kindle kept everything on the carasol until I decided to take an item off. I prefer having it that way. I called the kindle specialists, because I thought something was wrong with the kindle, but then they told me that is how this kindle is set up. I don't like that."
Very happy will be ordering g books soon
Great device for the price!
This brought me into the 21st century.  My first tablet ever but I got it for the Kindle. The only negative is when playing an audiobook the speakers are very 'tinny'.
"It's great for what it can do - reading books and stream certain things like Netflix and Hulu. However, it is terrible at surfing the web and a majority of apps do not work that well. The device is rather small - I tend to use my computer instead if I want to watch something and actually see everything. But, can't beat for the price."
"Love it! Works perfectly--easy to use, beautiful graphics."
it's k
Very useful and easy to navigate.
Love it
My daughter is very pleased with it.
i like being able to read in the dark. i am very old and it is taking a while to learn to operate it but i like it.
Great
I love it!! Great tablet
Absolutely love my kindle!!
My third upgrade. Nice hd display more options.
Very happy!!
"Handy little tablet, very pleased for doing basic tasks."
This fire came quickly and it is just what I expected . And a bit more I like the prime music and audio books (with adjustable speed of narration
"It's fast, easy to operate."
i have a kindle fire but its not good for school stuff. i try to do my online quizzes and practice guides and it wont let me open them. it dont support it. To me its like a huge phone.
"So, so handy...I can take it anywhere."
I finally updated from my second generation Kindle. I'm glad I did.
Exactly what I wanted.
I am still learning about it -- wish I had a comprehensive user's manual but so far I love it.
"I got this kindle on a day it was heavily discounted. Great deal. Even at full price it is still a good deal. Not as intuitive as Apple products are to use. But after using it a while Im sure I will figure out how to use it. There is an ad that shows up Everytime you turn it on, which is annoying. But I guess that is why it is cheaper than an iPad. It is an advertising machine."
Great got 16GBP.  No not use my laptop except for printing
Bought this as a gift for my 9 year old. We set up parental controls and let her have at it. She loves it.
I have been very pleased.
"Arrived on time. Was simple to register and start using. I know everybody is putting the help books online, but I still would have liked a print copy in case I'm not able to get a wifi signal."
I really like it.
Working great!  Came out of the box ready to use. I've thoroughly enjoyed watching movies on it with my Amazon Prime account.
Nice little device. Replaces my original nook. Got it for $99 and it is the 16gb model.
This is my 2nd Fire HD purchase and we love them for our kids.
"I got this at a great price and I am very pleased with it. I have a laptop and a desktop so this is just something I can carry with me to use while waiting in airports, doctors' offices, etc.  Display is good.  It is easy to use and I am enjoying my new gadget."
"Great for the price- if you have Prime, it's a no brainer. I have an HDX 8.9&#34; and looooove it. This is obviously not as good as that, but for $99 (on sale), it's great. The screen is good enough, it's fast, and the wifi card is fine. Of course it's not fantastic, but it is damn good for what you get.  The only negative for me is that this tablet was for my husband. I have an HDX 8.9. We share a Prime membership- DUH, we're married. He can't get our Prime stuff on his HD 7&#34;. I used the Mayday button on MY HDX 8.9 to ask about his HD 7 lack of Prime, and they said that they were working on it and that currently, he couldn't use Prime music or Instant Video on his tablet because the membership is in  my name. They said they knew about the issue and I could go ahead and pay for a prime membership for him and they would refund it.  Once again, Amazon provides great customer service. I just with they would think about issues like this beforehand.  That's the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5."
it arrived on schedule and was easy to set up.
I have the first generation kindle and this is far superior.  The screen and kindle free time are. Amazing
I've had this item for about a week I was looking for light reading and Internet access. This was exactly what I was looking for. Only issue is that the battery didn't hold up to my expectations but beside that it was amazing couldn't be happier
"It is great - ease of moving around from one thing to another - like it very much, would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of buying one."
Great tablet!! In love with it!!
"I don't see or have any of the special offers advertised as &#34;...included in purchase...&#34;.<br />Also, the screen is highly reflective so as an e-book reader or movie platform it is very difficult to use as such.<br />I really don;t know what to say that could be of great help to other prospective buyers.<br />H.Rojas"
I had no idea the Fire HD 7 could do so many things and do them so well.
For the money ($79 special sale price) this is a phenomenal deal.  Responsive enough for the cost and the best parental controls of any tablet out there.
Can't use yahoo messenger very cheaply made
Love my new Kindle Fire!
Love my fire!
Love It!
I love it!
Thanks you amazon the table fire HD thank you you are the best place to buy stuff
Really like the Kindle Fire!
Very handy device; L's learning to like it!
I really love it
"Hoping to play some games, but Android games not available on these<br />tablets. Still a nice tablet."
"I bought this to replace an older model. Although the screen is not much larger, the clarity is incredible. Amazing technology puts HDvideo right in my hand! Bonus it is lighter and thinner."
amazing  great for the sale price
"So far so good, would have been nice to get some type of manual or users guide."
"It does not have the Instagram app I have to go online for it, and I cannot change the ads on my display, I wanted to change my background to a picture and I could not do that either, I guess i will just work with what I have"
The HD 7 is great for reading books and magazines/newspapers. Of course the experience depends on the app. But overall I am satisfied.
"I'll be honest. I thought I would get a lot more out of this product then I did. its great for music and books, but it lakes as a tablet. Many apps you can not get and the fact you can not customize it at all. Not even your screen saver can change. I don't want to  bad mouth it because it's great for some one who reads a lot and does not mind the lack of apps."
"I'm glad I got it - I had a kindle fire but not a tablet - my other kindle was easier to navigate - this one not so much and there was no directions sent with it, the help is on the kindle which for me is more difficult.  The screen is very sensitive but I am getting the hang of it and would not consider that a detriment to buying his kindle.  The price was great."
I Like it!!!
So...so... I do not like the constant advertising...
"So far, this has been easier to work on that I expected and it's easy to use for reading. However, I'm a bit surprised at how quickly it runs out of juice when I read. Not sure what that's about; maybe I'm doing something wrong? I will do more exploring with it."
"The bomb! I loved my first generation Kindle fire, but this overcomes it's limitations, is better looking, loud AND CLEAR music, WONDERFUL VIDEO, longer life battery, and almost as much processing power as my wife's Acer ultrabook. Big Win Amazon!<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, the 2011 model is still very nice, a great good idea, but this is far beyond it in every way. I think I will sanitize the old one (erase all) and give it to a poor child up the street to get them started.<br /><br />Now to get it a nice white protective cover..."
Love it!
Love it!
I purchased this new generation Fire HD as my current one will only hold a charge for about 3 hours with use.  I had thought this new one would solve the problem.  The problem is the same and the battery life is no longer than the old one.  I'm disappointed.
Love it
I found it to be only slightly better than the Kindle fire I have now. I was unimpressed with overall operation and design. After a few days of using it I decided it was not worth the seventy-nine dollars I spent and afterwards I find that Amazon is charging two dollars and some change for shipping but really it's a restocking fee. I would look else where for a tablet.
Nice just what I wanted and needed it work great .
"This is my fourth Kindle, including an earlier Kindle Fire.  Not disappointed.  It is a great tablet for a remarkably low price !"
"I have had the device a few days and am figuring it out. It replaces one of the original Kindles that broke. In my opinion, the original was a far better device but is no longer available. I figured most out on my own but also called Kindle support. They were very helpful and patient and answered all my questions."
This is my fourth kindle fire and it is great.  The kindle was delivered as promised and is everything I expected. Fabulous!!!  Highly recommend.
"I really like my kindle fire he but I don't know what the specials that come with it are. The picture is great, I haven't watched a movie on it yet but I plan to."
I love it
"I wish there were more iOS games on it, or clash of clans, boom beach, etc"
I love it☺
Very easy to navigate.  Met my expectations.  Will enjoy this one as much as my last Kindle Fire HD...which I gave to my granddaughter😆
Fast shipping and wonderful Kindle. I love it.
I love my Kindle Fire ! It's more than I expected!
Good product.
"My granddaughter loves it.  She always wanted to use mine when she came to visit, so I surprised her with one in pink. One happy little girl."
Love it!!
It works great and it's a good price. Maybe a little less intuitive than some other tablets. Over all I'm happy with it.
Enjoying my Kindle. This is the second one in our home but the first one for me. Love having one of my own.
It would be better if you could read it outside.
Great tablet for the price. Love the cameras and great speaker quality!
I love the kindle but I never got the cover
I enjoy this tablet very very much
I love it!!
The size is just right for small hands.Display is excellent. Performance  is great.very happy with this fire hd of mine
Works very well downloads very nicely
love the back lighted book reading screen.
"I have mixed feelings about this tablet-- it's still new to me, so take that into account, however.  The screen images are pristine and the sound is far better than former tablets... that's the plus.  The negative is that it seems like they tried to create a wanna-be mac format, which I find uncomfortable in the first place.  Also I have yet to figure out how to get some of my favorite apps-- like nook (I realize that is the competition, however I have quite a library on it and don't want to give it up), and am having trouble even getting my playlist icon from my Amazon Prime music.  It's pretty far from &#34;intuitive&#34; and I suspect there's quite a learning curve. One thing I really don't like is that there is no option for an additional storage card--- everything goes to the &#34;cloud&#34;, which I think  is ultimately a recipe for disaster.  It's like having a car with a lease-- you can buy the equipment, but you have to keep paying in order to use it.  Don't think I would buy this a second time.  I look forward to seeing what kind of help is available by way of real human beings!"
Worth the 79 dollars. Had trouble running some apps. Parental controls are good. Not as functional as older iPad ie iPad 2<br />Good for kids to play games and watch Netflix and read books. Adults wanting adult toys should go Samsung or Apple.
EXCELLENT
Tremendous Value.  Beautiful display & faster than my IPAD.
Good for reading. Like the size. Don't like the web browser. Some apps are out of date...
"I love it! A nice upgrade from my Fire 1st generation.  I am still learning how to navigate as many things are very different from the last one.  I am also surprised at how quickly the battery level drops compared to my last one.  All in all, a pretty amazing device."
"I bought this for my grandson to replace his 2nd tablet that had not held up well (which was a replacement for the first one that didn't either) and could no longer be used at school.  When he opened the box his eyes just got huge and he come over and gave me the biggest hug--he is 13--he never hugs.  He also threw in a huge thank you.  I had ordered the citron green one out of the color choices as I figured everyone needs their tablet to stand out a little from everyone else's.  He was elated with the color.  Also had gotten the cover for it which is nice and substantial, has wonderful features including shutting down the tablet when you close the cover.  He takes it to school everyday, keeps a close eye on it, and has downloaded all sorts of free apps (I mention free because that is important).<br /><br />I had been looking at this tablet for quite some time and it was listed at $139 plus the cover.  Amazon notified me that it had gone on sale to $79 and I was hooked.  I do not really know the difference between one generation and the next for tablets and had to call Amazon to make sure the cover I wanted would fit the one I wanted to order.  I was assured it would (based on the 4th generation thing as apparently all covers for previous generations will not fit the newest generation).  That is nuts in my opinion, but that is the tablet and cover world apparently.  The cover is very firm, covers all edges of the Fire within itself and prevents trauma to the tablet, so to speak.  I had watched lots of those commercials talking about this and how they are tested.  Knowing what the previous tablet had gone through, this is the one that fit the bill.  I also opted for 8GB rather than 16GB when I ordered it as another 8GB your bill goes up another $20.<br /><br />All in all we are extremely happy with this purchase.  It arrived slightly ahead of schedule and very well packaged like a heavy book would be.  I would recommend this highly.  Of course it comes with the charging cable and was ready to go right out of the box.  It is not quite as large as some others but offers everything the others do.  And it does everything  my grandson needs it to do at school."
I did not receive a AC Power cord.  The only way that I can charge it is if it is connected to a USB Port off my computer.  Why isn't there an AC Power Cord to accompany the Kindle so it can be charged by plugging it into the wall socket.
"Love this thing, only problem with it is that you will need a 16 GB. The 8GB only comes with 3.5 gigs of useable storage. Wasn't expecting that at all, thought it would be at the most 2 GB for the OS. Other then that it's great."
Bought as a second tablet. Display is very good. Very happy overall. Would give five stars except some apps are not yet available. Also like sound better then my HP7.
Wow.  n do so much.  And I don't need the 16MB of memory.
I had the Kindle fire and really like it except it doesn't hold a very good charge. I love all the new improvements on the Fire HD but I also noticed it still doesn't hold a very good charge...better than my first one but not as good as I hoped. Would have rated it 5 stars if it had longer battery life!
I like the graphics.it is very clear.
Great internet pad for not a wholen lot of money. I got mine for $79 during a one day sale. The display is stunning and the speed is as fast as I need it to be. I was pleasantly surprised that I could download most of my favorite apps including Netflix. I haven't signed up for Amazon Prime yet but I am looking forward to exploring all the possibilities.
$79 special one day sale
"Purchased as daily value. Great value.  Great device. This is my second fire (third Kindle).<br />I am a Prime member and very pleased with membership perks, tech support and costurmer service."
Got mine for $80!  Great price.... easy to use. So far I am quite happy!
I like it but wish the page turning button;s of the original kindle were still there.  still learning how to use all the features and capabilities.
Irritated by the forced use of the web browser but overall very pleased with the kindle fire.
"I still have my Kindle fire, but wanted the Bluetooth and HD available on the kindle fire HD, so when Amazon ran a great sale, I got one.  Extremely satisfied!  (but I have been extremely satisfied with all my Kindles!)"
"I liked my old one much better. This one was supposed to have an output slot and an input slot. It doesn't have either one. Also, it is much too expensive for."
"Graphics great, easy to use, and lots & lots of apps available. The whole family enjoys using. Plan on buying another on soon."
Not much information enclosed.
Love it!
"I love my Fire HD, it is easy to use and lots of apps available. I can do so much on it and take it with me."
Adding an account for children meant re-downloading all the apps I allowed them access to.
"Awesome! Got them for my 6 and 8 year old children. Easy to use, many free game and educational apps available. Was the daily deal for $79 !"
"My wife has a kindle fire Hdx third generation, and I was really excited about getting mine.  Hers can get a wifi signal all over but I have to be almost on top of the transmitter to get a signal.  It takes forever to down load books and forget prime music.  I tried Prime but the music plays in spits and spats and forget about any video.  Very disappointed in my fire and Prime."
It is frozen!! Only able to use it for a week. Sending it back!!
I recommend Investment in extra memory
Great little tablet! Has everything I need except I cant get some of the Xfinity Apps I would like to use.
Very nice
Not anything like my phone
"I've been working through a learning curve for finding what I want to do on this but as a Samsung user it's just that things are differently located. All me, not the product :) The Fire is a great product, I also have a 6 and am very happy with both of them, thank you!<br />AND I got it on a sale price!"
"I love my new Kindle Fire!  As a lifelong reader, I was opposed to an e-reader for so long, because absolutely love the heft, smell and feel of a book, and knew I would miss out on those tactile aspects of reading.  However, as a lifelong reader, I knew there was no way to accommodate all of the books I want to read (yes, they still have those strange buildings called &#34;Libraries&#34;, but I like to keep my books all to myself lol!).  The Kindle is the perfect solution that storage problem.  The light, bookmark, and &#34;percentage read&#34; features are really cool and the graphics and display on the Tablet side are beautiful.  The thing that kept me from awarding 5 stars is that the Kindle Fire lacks a way of organizing the Library.  I would love to be able to categorize books by Author, or put a series in chronological order - the haphazard way books are loaded into the device is wreaking havoc on my OCD.  Aside from that, my Kindle is perfect!"
"Good , thanks"
So far so good. The table is working well. my Daughter loves it with some of the Apps that i downloaded in ...<br />The camera hummm don't know what to say. Not so good i shall say...
Nice unit. Still learning how to use it.
"Very happy, no complaints yet."
Awesome
Looked 4 months. Bought an Asus WiFi wouldn't work. Sent it back to Amazon recvd full refund. This tablet went on sale bought it been using it & working fine. Amazon has the books & game apps I like & use. Loaded my library. Still have 11 gigs free. I thought I needed an SD card but I don't d/l movies so I'm good. Didn't really like the thought of no Google but I'm on & off my phone a lot so I'll just continue to surf w/ it.
My 5 year old.daughter loves her new kindle fire & it was delivered sooner than it was supposed to..
My first one. Excellent.
I love it!
Excellent!!!-great battery life
I love it.....really enjoying it....
I love it. It does everything that I expected and then some . I bought mine when it was on sale for $79 wow what a deal .
"The Fire HD 7 works faster than I expected, processor speed is good, I can move around at a good pace, not much lag. Screen is good not great, battery life holding up 2 days with moderate use. I have mixed feelings about the power button, on one side I feel the button is too recessed and tricky to find the other is I'm not accidentally pressing it all the time. I'm pleased enough to seriously consider purchasing the Fire 8.9 HDX to replace my Nexus 10. I just ordered the origami case for it, hope to make it easier to hold, kind of awkward without case, hope I chose a good case... All things considered I feel I got a good value for the money."
"Great item, as usual."
"Excellent screen and colours.I still have a lot to learn about it<br />I was disappointed that it went on sale a couple of weeks later,but I still enjoy it.Reading books on it is wonderful,so clear and bright."
"I have the original Kindle, and this version is such an improvement in capability. I am very pleased."
"I still use a &#34;flip phone&#34;, and until now, used only a lap top. This is my first tablet, and I'm still learning stuff, but I can tell, already, my lap top is going to collect dust! This Fire tablet has blown me away!"
"wasn't cobalt blue, but I like it a lot.  They sent me a black one just like my husband's"
Great value for a tablet
Lots faster than my old one. I really like it.
An early 18th birthday present from my mom. I love it! She figured since i'm always playing her kindle she'd get me one of my own. Tomorrow[May 2nd] is my birthday sooo happy early birthday to me. Lol.
An excellent product I use every day!
Still learning about all it can do.
Exceeded expectations!
Love it. Saw it as a daily deal for $60 off and bought it. It has a good selection of Apps and as a Wi-Fi connector I can access my online material. I am hard of hearing (wear hearing aids) and the sound is incredible. 1 critique is the micro USB port and no being able to add a flashdrive or external harddrive but even this is negated by the uploading to servers (amazon or apple).
Fantastic overall. This is my second fire and I have very impressed so far.
Very easy to use
"I bought one for myself and one for my husband while they were on sale. We are absolutely loving them. I've been reading books, listening to music and playing games. My husband loves how he can play his sudoku, keep up with his favorite football team and listen to music. My daughter has had her kindle for a couple of years and I am so happy to have my own now. I didn't pay the extra to have the ad taken off, but it's no big deal. I did pay to get the 16GB so we have room to grow, so-to-speak. My only complaint is that I wish it had the ability to use an SD card. But, otherwise, couldn't be happier."
Love it!
Great item :)
Excellent screen & speed. The clarity is amazing.
Sweet!
"Arrived fast. So far excellent. I have been using the original Kindle Fire for years with no troubles, and gifted it to my hubby when my new Kindle arrived."
Pleased with all
It's great. Easy to use battery last for a long time.  I love it!
Got one for my mom and she loves it aha she cant put it down...now im gonna get one!
Love it..
I like the rear facing camera which is why I ordered it.  however the print sixe does not go as large as the older version which is one of the things I liked about the older version.  the older version was easier to read.
Love love love it so bright
"For the price point, the tablet is good. But the Amazon store lacks in terms of the offered apps. Its good for first time tablet users but not for experienced users."
"I like the tablet, but really wish there was a slot for an sd card as well as the ability to download apps from Google's play store.  We bought 1 there and we have to rebuy the same app at Amazon's site if we want it on the kindle.  I strongly prefer Amazon over Google, but we are unlikely to buy more kindles if we have to rebuy the same apps.  Thanks for making a good tablet otherwise."
"I got the Fire 7 HD on sale and for the money, it's perfect! It's portable which is great for traveling. I use it for entertainment... watching shows, reading, music, and social networking. It's a little slower than other tablets I've owned, (ipad, galaxy) but, like I said, for what I paid ($79) it's great!"
Love it..the color ..the clarity and now with a camera its great...and then getting it on sale ...i just couldn't afford not to buy it
Perfect for all my needs.
Love it! I had an older one which I will give to a friend.
love the new features
"gave it  one star cause there is no choice for zero stars.  total disaster for me. no instruction manual on the device, on line support was a joke, shows an index, but information is generalized and not clear or in depth. tried to work my way through camera use and took several pictures, then the camera decided to go from back hd camera to front, and started taking selfies of my ugly face.  after using kindle readers for a few years, and loving their simplicity and ease of use. this , to quote obama, &#34;is way over my pay scale&#34;. tired of trying to figure out how any of the features work, and am asking amazon for instructions to return it."
"My first Kindle Fire, bit the bullet suddenly with no warning, I use it so much that I had to order another, thank goodness there was a wonderful sale on it. I still would like to know what happened to my first one, I had planned on getting a 2nd because the 1st was full. I have Prime, and the monthly books to borrow, I love it, and cant live without it !!!"
"Love it!!! Much better that previous one, picture and sound quality are excellent, and it's easy to navigate !!"
This is my second Kindle.  The first one lasted three years.  I am soooo very happy to have my new Kindle Fire.
"My original tablet was a Kindle. I switched to another brand (Samsung) and hated it. Every day I would turn it on and say to my wife, &#34;Have I told you how much I miss my Kindle?&#34; So I am back with my first love."
I didn't purchase from this particular seller but I'm proud to be an owner of this product. It's amazing and very easy to use. It's a definite upgrade from my old tablet. Great product
"It's awesome, as good as ipad. But much cheaper than ipad"
A fun toy.  I like reading on it; I didn't think I would.  I still have to decide whether I like it better when I want to mark a passage.  I wish there were more foreign language magazines available.  But it's fun learning the abilities.
Love this little thing. Has quickly taken the place of my laptop. Great apps for kids and of course- books! :) Happy I got one!
This is my fourth Kindle and I do love being able to use as a tablet and for reading. It is small enough to carry easily in my purse for appointments and travel. Thank you.
Great love the way the movies look in HD
"love my new Kindle Fire, i love the color purple, beautiful HD colors, thank you Amazon"
Just received this the other day and I love it! I have a ton of e-books that I transferred over without a hitch. Super fast and great clarity!
"I like the graphic and the size of the Fire HD 7, and a good value too.  I can take this device everywhere, I am very happy with the product."
Great best display ever😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🎻
This is a great item that I am still learning on how to use.  I have Amazon Prime and this really comes in handy to enjoy all the stuff you get for free!
I have enjoyed it so far.
I was surprised at how good this tablet actually is. The display is crisp and very clear. The camera good as well lots of free apps and tech support resolved the one issue I had before I had spent 3 minutes on the phone with them.
Awesome product.
"Love the size and weight of this reader.  A bit of a learning curve coming off a regular &#34;read only&#34; Kindle. Nevertheless, it was certainly a great value when I got it on a daily deal at almost half off.  To do it again, I would have picked the one without the ads.  They're just annoying."
I was disappointed. I loved my kindle fire I received a couple years ago.  I enjoy reading and the ease of the carousel and the easy organization of my magazine and books.  I miss.  Plus knowing which books I have read.  along with the favorite section.  Since I already own two tablets. I really didn't need a third.  Sorry I'm just not a fan
"Great price, fast and free shipping to Alaska and I'm impressed with the quality of this product."
"The Fire HD 7, 7&#34; HD Display more that met my needs. What a surprise! I absolutely love it and even my husband is impressed!"
love it
Awsome
So far not impressed not as user friendly as the iPad and the advertisements in the apps are annoying. Great price though.
"This Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD tablet is perfect.  I purchased this specifically to take when I travel.  I have a 10&#34; tablet that I take with me on vacations but I wanted something a little smaller that provided me with all the benefits of my tablet.  This is perfect!  Large enough to watch Netflix and You Tube but compact enough to throw in my purse.  This is easy to use, efficient and has a crystal clear image.  The price was too good for me to give up!"
"Really enjoying it,  good speakers, fine for games and Skyping. Not so good for reading, too much glare on the screen. Using my Kindle Touch for reading."
Very nice more than expected.
"A little less advanced, I think, than my first generation Kindle Fire, and the cameras are terrible, but it's an all around good Kindle.<br /><br />Came in a TERRIBLE shipping box that wasn't even sealed shut, though."
"quick, clear to read and versatile."
Awesome! Love it!
The Kindle is great but the shipping was terrible.
Seems to work well was bought for grandkids they like it so far
"Paying to remove ads sucks. No SD card slot. Harder to add and search for books than it should be. Nothing special. Better than my old Coby, but not by much. Cheap tablet and it shows."
Love it.
Great<br />The only thing I'm not to impress is the camara.
"LOVE the new tablet!!  Though it is smaller than I thought it would be, turns out to be the perfect size!!!"
The kindle fire was easy to set up apps are good but much different from Apple products I will have to get used to the difference
Great tablet- but battery runs out very quickly!
"Bought it for my wife for Mothers Day and gave it to her early. What a great, excellent tablet! We would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a quality product at a reasonable price. BUY IT!"
My first tablet and I love it.
Still figuring everything out...but still loving it!
Very pleased with my purchase!
Great
"I had used an Apple iPad for five years but when it finally started to fail I looked at some other alternatives. The Kindle Fire had some great reviews and nothing could beat the price so I decided to give it a try. This is a great tablet for internet surfing and email,and of course easy access to Amazon books and videos. I have not missed any function of the iPad, and I certainly didn't miss the price."
Love it. But is a little hard sometimes to move things with my finger. But still love it.
"Wow! I am upgrading from a generation 2 Kindle...and baby, you have changed! I love the front and rear cameras...and firefly does come in handy. The sound is wonderful and I love it!"
Good item at great value.
"I bought it for a gift for my wife & she loves it. We have been a iPhone / iPad family in the past , but for the price fire 7 blows mini iPad out of the water.  Now amazon needs to make a smart phone"
The picture and sound quality of the Fire HD 7 is remarkable. It is a huge upgrade from my old android.
I love this thing.perfect size.. great quality picture...the sound is amazing for such small speakers.woo hoo!
"This tablet overall is great! It has a beautiful display, and it's very durable. The battery life is above-average but not great. The main reason it didn't receive a 5 star rating is due to the annoying lock screen advertisements. If I find that there is a setting to disable it I'll update my rating. Overall this tablet is WELL worth the price!"
"I have an IPad and a tablet but prefer the kindle over them all.  Easy to use and just the right size.<br />And now I have a new Kindle Fire HD with front and rear camera I LOVE IT!  Nice clear good pictures,easy to read<br />Great library start a book and take it with you wherever you go .  THANKS !!!!"
i like it alot
"Kids bought these for themselves- they're easy to use, and I love the parental controls. I chose the larger memory so they can grow with them."
Exactly what I was looking for! Beautiful crisp resolution. No lag in selecting icons or navigating. This is my third tablet purchase and am definitely satisfied based on price and quality. Would recommend!
It is great but I did not like that I had to pay $15 to get the special offers screen off.  I would not have mined the special offers except that they came up every time in awoke from sleep instead of where I had been before putting it to sleep.  Otherwise I was very impresses with what the Fire HD could do.
It's okay.  The on off button is very small and hard to use.
I didn't know I could miss something as when my old one broke.when this one came on sale I couldn't wait and really love it.
Great!
"replaced my 1st Gen Fire. great look and feel to new version, but the carousel is even more goofy this time. need to research how to customize."
I'm so excited I can access my photos on my kindle.  So far I'm loving this kindle.
GOOD job
Needs more apps! No instagram???!!!
Freaking love this thing!!
I'LL LOVE IT MORE AS SOON AS I LEARN MORE ABOUT Personal set up
Expectations are met.  Although a bit heavy
"Okay so I really wanted to like this (specially I got 60 dollars off). The speakers are amazing. I like the feel very confident, and even it having a camera, though bad, was extremely nifty Netflix works. . .<br /><br />It lacks a bent for supporting Google Docs (no option for Chrome without sideloading apps). Multitasking is odd here. Plus they have a stranglehold on other apps (even instagram unless sideloaded) and files like EPub. The one redeeming quality was Prime's free book a month, but it would take to long (unless you have kindle unlimited)"
My daughter and my son-in-law know of my love to read and gave this to me as a gift. Best gift ever !  Still learning the in's and out's but overall very happy with it.
I love it. It has met my expectations.
"love it so far, trying it out and seeing what else I like about it so far is fun."
Love my Kindle!!!! It is great!!!!
very happy with the fire hd 7 and the help I needed with registration. It is just what I expected when ordering it.
"It is not quite like my 1st one, which still survives. I just wanted the great deal I got. Thank you Amazon."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get up and running. Bought this prematurely because it looked like my old Kindle Fire was toast, but it turns out, it still works. HD will make my wife's novel reading easier. So far, I prefer the flip through list of apps better. Also liked how the links embedded in my sports page app went right to YouTube and started playing seemlessly. Not true on the original Kindle Fire.   On the other hand, the print option is so far, a non-starter. It looks like you have to download a printer specific app (I did), but the directions offered after that are, to me, vague. (Irony: after struggling with Windows 8.1 a little, I turned on my printer, the new computer &#34;found it,&#34; and I was good to go. Why couldn't it have been this simple? And if I can't use it, well, the blush is off the rose, right?"
Best tablet I have ever bought.
Got this as a step up from my old kindle fire and what a difference in technology. No more skipping videos or slow loading. This thing is awesome. Wish I had gotten it sooner and am loving the camera that goes both ways. Great value.
I love this tablet! And I got it during the one day sale for $79!
My kids love it.
I love it.
Not a lot of memory and lacks micro SD slot
"I love my Fire! As a matter of fact, this is my third. I had to purchase this one since my battery died in my old one. The only disappointment is that I can't log onto my Google Chrome account to view my bookmarks and sync my content."
It's great!  I've owned two Nooks before finally taking the plunge and buying a Kindle. I'm so glad I did. I can do the same things on it that I can do on my computer. Won't go back to the Nook!
"Great pad, nice picture,  leading to use it"
My 3 kindle speaks for itself.
Some screen are little confusing to use. But I am very happy with my purchase.
"Well, I have mixed feelings. We bought the Kindle Fire HD for my daughter who is 3 years old. However, it wouldn't allow the download of abcmouse.com or the Disney movie app, which is why we wanted her to have her own tablet. I was set to return it to Amazon, but instead, we decided to give her my Samsung Galaxy Tablet and I took the Fire HD since I basically read work emails, read on Kindle and shop. I like the tablet for myself, but it has definite limitations."
"Slow and awful. Really bummed about buying this tablet. Can't change your background, and you CANT download any Google apps. And you have to have a card to download anything for this tablet even if it's free. Feels like I'm beenin told what to do WITH MY TABLET. Don't waste your hard money on this."
"Nice tablet but doesn't allow Google play, Amazon has stopped the fix called rooting so that you can use the play store."
HOT LIKE FIYA!!!  YUP...
This is my 2nd Fire HD. My husband took over our first Fire HD. Enjoy them both.
Awesome deal and my daughter loves it
"Love the kindle HD 7. My second kindle, love it, now have one for car to use at the doctors office for my books and games and one at home on my end table. Excellent tablet."
Love it! What an improvement over the 2nd generation. It even lets me print wirelessly to my printer. Processor is much faster too. Love the HD also.
"Very nice upgrade from my old Kindle Fire.  I DO miss the colored button that let me know the battery was charged on the Fire. The HD7 was reasonably  priced, arrived as promised, and was simpler to set up.  Nice reception, clarity and vibrant color."
This is my third kindle and I love it!  My grandkids love them too!  Easy to use and great for the price and durable with the kids!
"I bought this tablet for my kids and it is great. We had an iPad that stopped working properly and I wanted something cheaper that they could use to play games, apps, get on the internet with, and take pictures. The Fire does all of these things and for much cheaper than the iPad. There are some apps that do not work on the Fire, because they only make versions for the iPad, such as the Nick Jr. app, but other than that I have no complaints. It is the perfect size and very easy to use."
I love this device.
great product and super shipping  Really love the new one
Luv luv love it!!!
Came fast New in perfect shape as described awesome tablet
"my original Kindle had a defective wi-fi connectivity issue and was out of warranty, Amazon's customer service was very frustrating and I finally gave up and purchased this one."
Got it for my 7 year old grandson.  He's in 7th heaven right now!!!
Love my new Kindle Fire.  It does everything that I need it to do and works perfectly with my wireless flash drive.
I do not want to post a negative review.
Loving the fire HD so clear
"Got the 7&#34; 16gb version here, updating my original 5 star rating I gave it when I first got it only had using it for a week I had no idea the horror that I had purchased. I have had this since april of 2015, so 3 months later I have quite allot of time invested into using this machine and feel I have enough insight to give this review. First week, great, works amazing. Month goes by and I see that its getting sluggish, I do everything I know to remedy this 1. Ensure I am cold booting and not putting the machine to sleep so to refresh the ram and system everyday 2. Keep it well charged ensuring all the parts inside have enough power to work at their optimum levels 3. Get the best system cleaner app I can to ensure nothing runs that doesn't need to and everythings cleared out every once in awhile while using it. This did not help. I keep from downloading anything really mostly just using a couple books for school and the internet browser. Tried a couple game but uninstall when it feels sluggish.  2 months later things are even worse than ever. I do a factory reset after nothing works and the machine still runs like garbage. My cousins Nexus 7 2010 works better than this piece of trash. But I feel that after a couple more updates things might improve, maybe its a software issue. Well a couple updates later, 3 months later I am here to tell you this thing is a piece of trash. Is it worth buying? Sure, but not for what they are asking for. This is a $60-$80 machine at best. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I am very disappointed in amazon and I regret this purchase everyday. Todays inspiring review update is from the system completely crashing on me while pausing a youtube video and stepping away for a moment. Upon returning the machine was completely unresponsive and I had to hold the power button to turn it off, then it wouldnt turn on and I got a message that the system crashed and recommended restoring factory setting -_- quad core, 1gb ram my ass. I don't know whats in this but its trash. My dual core, 1gb padfone x mini is twice as fast as this somehow and it is way more responsive too. Thats just embarrassing."
I love it
Love it!!  So glad we purchased this.
Really Fun!
Great device! I'm loving my new Fire HD!
"I purchased this one, my second one, As a gift for a family member. She is enjoying it.  I kept my old one and love mine."
"I like it, it is easy to use"
Some said &#34;better than iPad mini&#34;.<br />Not!
"This is my first tablet and is a great beginner.  It came with my Kindle e-books already synchronized and was easy to set up our two email accounts.  Downloading apps is simple.  I purchased this as an alternative to carrying my laptop, power pack and separate carrying bag while traveling, for the purpose of checking our email.  This is a nice introduction to tablets."
"Love my Fire HD, one of the best gifts I have ever received. Colors are so clear and true to life. This can do anything my laptop can plus the fact its so easy to take anywhere,whether for reading, game playing or whatever. I have recommended this item to a few of my friends."
"I love it! I also have a first-edition Nook, and this just blows my Nook out of the water! I love being able to read in the dark, play my favorite games, check email, etc. And there are lots of other things my Fire can do, that I haven't even had a chance to try yet!"
"Replaced my original Kindle, which I gave to my son.  So far, I like it a lot."
Great but the storage sucks
"Great little device, especially when you get it on sale!"
Love the camera enjoy the I pad only wish the Fire HD 7 would have a connection for a HDMI hook up to TV
"This little device is amazing...I love the size and weight...As a photographer, I never wanted to carry around a lap top ( this fits nicely in the front of my camera bag) ..so i  figure i would try this instead, its really cool, i can or you can down load your images right away and see the results, which to me is fantastic, I got the usb connection cable and plug it in and then take the usb cable for my camera and connect them...and in seconds there are your photos. I have trouble looking at my photos on the back of the camera, lets face it a 2 inch screen is a little hard to look at, but with this its so much better, this is 5x7 and much easier to see. If i don't like the photo i can delete. If you like you can save them to the kindle or not..which is really great. After seeing them I can get prints made at any K-Mart,Walmart,CVS,Walgreens for about .25cents...which is really nice when your with friends or family and they always want a copy. Plus its nice to be able to show people my work and direct them to my web-site so they can purchase my work. So I hope this review is helpful. Thanks for reading this far ! Enjoy and Happy Shooting !"
I like it so far.
The battery doesn't last very long & every time I move my fingers I lose my place & can`t find it again. I think I like it but the old kindle was easier to operate.
"I've owned practically one of each generation of Kindle Fire (7 inch) model.  I purchased this model after seeing a promo in 4/2015.  I wanted an upgrade in the software over the 2nd generation of devices.  The interface was snappy and I was able to load all of my apps from my previous kindle.  After about a week of moderate use, the device stopped responding.  I was able to contact support to troubleshoot the device, for which they are sending a replacement.  Unfortunately, they are out of stock and I have to wait almost a month to use my new device.  I'm just a bit disappointed in the build quality of this device as I have never had any issues with previous models.  The stinger is that I was told that I could use the apps or other devices to view my content.  I know that I can, but it makes me regret making this purchase and I will now think twice about future kindle purchases."
I love my kindle.
"I travel so it's the perfect size, easy to use and easy on your eyes to read!  Love how you can download documents and they are clear! It has everything I need and use."
"Definitely great for the price. It's a bit on the heavy side, and it shows if you have to hold it with one hand for a long time, but otherwise this is an great deal. Videos and pictures are really crisp. Lot's of apps. I prefer it to my iPad because of its more compact size."
Awesome tablet for the money. .my daughter loves it. .
Amazon is very limited when it comes to apps its not like the Google playstore.<br />This im sure will change im due time but as for now nope. As for the device itself its very good! It feels great and im in love! In love with the speaker quality
ILove it. I needed something that easily fit in with my on the go life and this does. It was reasonably priced. In fact the family seems to want to borrow it all the time.
quick and clear very happy
Love It so Fun to Use The Books Are awesome
"Better than I expected! I have one that is a couple years old, it doesn't even compare!!"
"so far, it has gone way beyond my expectations."
