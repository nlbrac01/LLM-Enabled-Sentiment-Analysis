Great love it
Lots of ads<br />Slow processing speed<br />Occasionally shuts down apps<br />WIFI keeps having authentication issues<br /><br />Was cheap for a tablet and now i know why.
"Excellent unit.  The versatility of this tablet, besides being competitively priced is a solution to the elderly.  Poor eyesight and physical disabilities associated with age and using the supporting add on features allows the user to stay in touch with our changing world.<br />A realistic add on keyboard that you can see and use.<br />I cannot wait to use my Fire HD7 to show computer created work sheets and class instructions to my students. (HMDI) Good by to copiers and reams of paper, Farwell to those costly printer inks!<br /><br />Oh yes I have much more to gain back.  Just takes a little effort to learn more, open a book and read.<br />Noel"
I bought this on Amazon Prime so I ended up buying the 16gb one for $95.  The camera is okay and I love the edit features you can do to the pictures.  Amazon/Netflix/Huliu all run smoothly on this tablet. The internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too.  While over all I am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that I wanted to make sure other people are aware of.  I am an Amazon Prime member and I thought that with Amazon Prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free. :(  Also one of the main reasons we purchased  a tablet was because my kids love the Plants vs Zombies games.  The kids were quite disappointed that Plants vs Zombies 2 is not available for the fire.  There are also other games/apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the Fire that were available for our previous cheaper Neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet.  I recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying.
All Amazon products continue to meet my expectations
Good product. I like it ðŸ˜€
"This kindle works well but the battery goes dead more quickly than you'd expect. Really it is a version of the previous Kindle that weighs less. The internet browser works considerably better than the previous but still has issues loading certain websites. Pop-up ads are a challenge at times. Other than that it is about the same as the older version, a good product that serves its purpose well but I wouldn't rave about it."
"I really enjoy my new kindle, it is easy to use and offers plenty of useful and entertaining activities"
"It's what I wanted and performs perfectly. Everything works great, the menu system is awful. I'd go 5 stars if the menu system were better."
Made well. Like looks and style
Yes it met all of my needs 5 Stars
We have the old kindles but this one does a lot more.  Love it
Great product
The only complaint I have about this kindle is that the camera takes &#34;grainy&#34; pictures. After trying everything to fix the problem the pictures are not good.
great
"Just got it.  The promotional price was very good.  I was worried as my last android device was a real turkey.  My main purpose for this was as a reader .  It downloaded everything fairly fast and with no problems, from my Overdrive app.  I really need it for traveling.  It's a perfect size  The screen resolution if great.  I am not sure of the sound quality yet, but it expect it to be as good as most apple phones.  Amazon really bends over backwards to keep it's prime customers happy.  I really appreciate the good service."
I love this product
Love it!!!
"I really like using this HD display. I have not used all its features yet, but what I have used I live."
"Everything I expected and more. Have already gotten hours of entertainment and information. So much easier to read from, than paperbacks especially on vacation."
Its a nice tablet but I was disappointed to see that they deliberately made using Chromecast impossible
"Don't waste your money buying a kindle fire hd 7&#34;. You'll do 100 better buying any other tablet on the market. The Kindle is limited by Amazon and purposely doesn't allow downloads of apps that aren't on Amazon market place.  This tablet has soooo many problems !! AS in :  slow connection to internet, NO connection to internet possible much of the time, slow or no connection to videos, games, etc. NO support!!! Just reading other problems from other owners.  So, do yourself a huge favor and buy ANYTHING ELSE!!!  Mine was a gift from my well-meaning son."
"Still just as slow and glitchy as the first edition fire. Still not flash compatible which renders the browser useless. Freezes constantly, crap battery life and regularly occuring issues with loading the page you were on last.  Incredibly disappointing."
"I love it, I just wish I could download books without having internet service like I could with my keyboard Kindle."
Was a gift
Doesn't have as much space as I thought it has.
Excellent device. HD is top notch. Sound is great. Would definately recommend Fire HD
Just have to learn how to use
"I'm happy with my new Kindle Fire.  However, this is my second one because after a little more than a year, my first Kindle cannot be used since it refuses to charge up.  (Not happy about that!)"
I thought I would have to ask a professional to set me up with my new Kindle Fire HD.  NOT SO. I was able to program the Kindle easily on my own.  All of my previous books were already there. (In the Clouds). I was also able to download a few songs on my own.  I am enjoying my Kindle Fire HD.
Great item
I finally gave in a replaced my Paperwhite with a Fire. I really loved my Paperwhite and I think I'm going to love this as well. I use it every day and I get a little upset when I accidentally leave it at home and I don't have it with me.  This is one of the best purchases I've made for myself.
Perfect size with great capabilities. Very excited that  I made the choice to finally purchase one of these.
We've bought several for family members!
I have a Kindle addiction!
"Won't stay connected to the WiFi, am having to constantly log in no matter where I am (public, home, etc)."
The unit came with NO directions of use of any kind.  Don't know how to use it.  Guess I will have to buy a kindle.
Overall it's good for the kids.  I don't take advantage of all the things it can do.  But some things are confusing like how apps are loaded and then given to other profiles.  Each app uses space and must be loaded to each profile.  So for me the same app is taking up space 3 places for each profile.  And if you delete an app from the main profile it does not delete from the others.  And for the kids profile I can seem to get it removed at all!  It's not in the device screen but still shows in settings-it's really confusing.
Does everything I wanted it to do.
"It works so well, and fast! Not using it much yet until case comes in for fear of scratching fab display!"
Good value but the operating system is a little buggy. It periodically crashes and requires rebooting.
"I find that is not as easy to use as my regular Kindle Fire.  When I am reading the kindle it freezes up (because you hold it on the side).  Also you have to get out of it to brighten or darken your text that you are reading.  Lastly, the advertisements that come up every time you turn the HD Kindle Fire on are annoying."
"Returned.  Prefer a more open android tablet.  As far as quality...it is Amazon and they never disappoint.  So, if you are a strict Amazonian - this tablet is for you.<br /><br />The 2 stars are personal choice, not quality."
Love it!  Convenient and use the library to download books!  Should have done this a long time ago!
This generation has perfected the placement of all the ports. Very fast operation. Excellent sound. I love my new Kindle Fire HD!!
Can't personalize or connect with google.
It was a gift and  much appreciated.  I love it
Love it.
"The sound is amazing. The video is the best. I don't bother watching the news on the television anymore, I go straight to my Kindle Fire."
"This is the first real tablet I've used with any success. I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected."
Love it.
Great!
"Kindle is like a little computer that is lite to carry n your pocketbook n take with u everywhere.  The site comes n clear n safe. I use this device, more than my laptop. I can't wait to explore what else it has to offer."
Good choice
I like everything about it except that I don't think the battery lasts as long as my other one did.
"Five Stars, only one request to make it easier to exit full screen. ðŸ˜‰"
It is so easy to use. Books are easy to read and I carry it everywhere with me.
Great product
"Love it , everything I wanted in a kindle"
Great tablet from amazon love the new changes with HD and speed
I have two. One for each of us. We both love them!!
"This is my 3rd Kindle.  First was only for reading, 2nd was Kindle Fire which I really liked but did not have enough storage capacity so I got this Kindle Fire HD that has more storage than I'll need.  I have books and games on it and can use for anything I want on the internet. Great product!"
My third kindle and I have loved them all. Kindle support sucks but the device rocks.
Fantastic!ðŸ˜¯
We have two kindle fires. The 7 and the 6. They will not connect to my WiFi and if I finally get them to connect it only lasts for a few minutes. I have tried everything to fix but nothing works. I will never buy another kindle fire... Amazon doesn't offer any help to fix the problem.
My old kindle was actually a better one.The speakers on this one stink.sound is distorted and fuzzy at best.It sounds as if the speakers were blown from the day I got it.it's a fourth generation and if I had to buy again I wouldn't.
I love my fire
So far so good.  Wanted a small reader that could also be used to access my e-mail and this looks like it will fill the bill.  Will be able to travel and leave my laptop at home.  Love that it has a USB port.
love it
"Bad assemble, barely works."
i lve this tablet. it was a little different to get used to but now I love it. Very clear screen. Nice to hold. Very Durable!
Cumbersome to use.  Ads pop up all the time.  Carousel hinders more than helps.  I like to use hard copy of instruction manuals but I cannot find a way to print one so ordered one.<br /><br />I think Amazon Prime is great.  The fire is an ok buy for the money.
"Just received Kindle Fire last week and still getting used to it and learning new things. But so far, it's great. This is my second Fire and my third Kindle and thoroughly love it. I am an avid reader and would rather read from my kindle than a book."
Great product but hard to find a good case
It's so much faster. It's screen is a bigger.
I love this device but tried so many times still can't get wechat installed on my kindle fire. Help!
I love it.
Love it!
Works great. Couldn't be happier with this!
i returned item
This is my 3rd kindle. I received it for my birthday!!! The first one I gave to my niece and nephew. The 2nd one I gave to my son. I love it! It does everything that I need and with the prime membership I have access to so many free things from movies to songs! The picture quality is dramatically improved from my first one and I carry it with me all of time. Kudos to Amazon and I can't wait for the next big upgrade!!!
love it
Not that great. I bought for my granddaughters as a replacement and not big enough always saying delete out of room.Plus I thought it was all black like there old ones don't care for the white.
ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’›
Gift for grandson and he loves it!
"My mother bought this and it started having problems 8 months after she bought it, well it quit working 8 days after the 1 year mark and they REFUSE to replace it (told us she has to pay for a replacement).  They said that they don't even fix their products...Why would you sell a product that you cannot repair.  Mom is on a fixed income and cannot afford to buy another one.  I have 4 different Kindle products at this moment and now will be getting rid of ALL of them and going to the Ipads (at least they fix their products)"
Great product.  Received earlier than expected.  Expect to enjoy it greatly
"I am in love with my Kindle! It never freezes,with my other tablet could not even copy and paste.So easy to use and learn.Turned right around and let my daughter get one to!"
I paid 157.00 after the price with shipping and it is already giving me problems and I have not even had the item for a week...the Kindle will not stop freezing and the screen keeps going black... I am started to think I received a refurbished item because I should not be having these problems with the device this soon
"I love this little unite so far, and has more than I thought it would"
Very limited number of apps. Reading books it's ok but not a great tablet for all of the choices available on other devices.
Exceeds all expectations!
just wish when you buy the kindle from a retailer you could see the settings to show your memory and version instead of having to go to amazon website
I have always loved the kindle fire and still do
"This was a gift for my birthday and it was a wonderful surprise. The tablet exceeded my expectations performance wise and I just can't get enough of it. I would recommend this to everyone, it's a must have."
Excellent
Love the upgrade.
It was a birthday gift and I love it
My 8 and 7 year old love their tablets!
